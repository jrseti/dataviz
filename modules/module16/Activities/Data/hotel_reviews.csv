Rancho Valencia Resort Spa,5,Best romantic vacation ever!!!!,Our experience at Rancho Valencia was absolutely perfect from beginning to end!!!! We felt special and very happy during our stayed. I would come back in a heart beat!!!
Rancho Valencia Resort Spa,5,Sweet sweet serenity,Amazing place. Everyone was extremely warm and welcoming. We've stayed at some top notch places and this is definitely in our top 2. Great for a romantic getaway or take the kids along as we did. Had a couple stuffed animals waiting for our girls upon arrival. Can't wait to go back.
Rancho Valencia Resort Spa,5,Amazing Property and Experience,"We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again."
Aloft Arundel Mills,2,"Never again...beware, if you want sleep.",Currently in bed writing this for the past hr 1/2 there have been dogs barking and squealing call the front desk to advise basically to be told there's nothing they can do. 315.00 and I can't sleep.

Aloft Arundel Mills,5,Worth the money,"Beautiful rooms and the nicest people working there. The front desk lady, Olivia, was extremely patient and helpful. We had lots of questions and she had just as many answers. The rooms were sleek and modern. The only thing that would make this hotel better would be free breakfast, but I really am asking for a lot. A++ stay. Thank... More"
Aloft Arundel Mills,5,Great Hotel Experiece!,"We stayed here while visiting Maryland Live!. Cute hotel in a great location. Clean, with a very modern look, upgraded bathrooms and amenities and super nice staff. Would definitely recommend and stay there again!"
Aloft Arundel Mills,5,Short stay for business.,"I travel a lot with my job, so I'm constantly staying at hotels. When my co-workers and I arrived late last night at the Aloft the people at the front desk were more than welcoming. When I wanted to order room service I was told it was too late however, Olivia at the front desk informed me of a Italian... More"
Hampton Inn Suites PortlandVancouver,5,Amazing employees and facilities,"In my line of work, I use meeting space in hotels often. In my 15+ years of doing this work, this is the first time I've felt the undeniable pull to go out and write a hotel review, based solely on my meeting room experience. Though I did not use a guest room here, my colleagues who did shared that... More"
Hampton Inn Suites PortlandVancouver,5,I loved our stay here,"The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and nicely furnished. Feels new, as if we were the first to stay there. Actually it is more opulent than I require. The free breakfast was good with sufficient choices including fresh fruit salad, eggs, bacon, bagels and pastries and more. It was a great location for our purpose:... More"

We had a problem with the heating system in our room and they had someone fix it within minutes! Would highly recommend this location/hotel."
Hampton Inn Suites PortlandVancouver,5,Perfection,"Upon arriving I see modern yet elegant decor which is pleasing to the eye. The front staff are very friendly. The room was clean including details, I'm talking no dust,no hair in bathroom-shower or beds which I tend to find in other hotels. Kudos to housekeeping. Sheets were crisp,beds were comfortable especially since this is a newer hotel. Breakfast in... More"
Hampton Inn Suites PortlandVancouver,5,Good hotel. Worth checking out.,This is a nice hotel with great staff. I have young children and the entire staff from the front desk staff to the breakfast staff were there to help us. This was our first visit to the Portland area and we plan to go back later this summer. We will stay at this hotel when we return.
Hampton Inn Suites PortlandVancouver,5,Excellent!,"Beautiful property and every staff member I encountered (front desk, housekeeping, breakfast hosts and GM) provided beyond excellent customer service! It's also conveniently located near restaurants, grocery stores starbucks and is a short drive to the freeways. I will definitely be back!"
Hotel Phillips,4,Very pleased,Old hotel with many remaining architectural charms and most modern amenities. The staff is exceptional: friendly and very accommodating. Has a little bit of the wear tear around the edges associated with an historic building but remarkably clean. Passed the allergy test.
Hotel Phillips,5,Excellent Stay,Very comfortable room. Our son came and they had a couch that they pulled out into a queen size bed. Free wifi and bottled water. This hotel was built back in the 20's and the decor is fabulous. A very neat hotel.
Hotel Phillips,3,Beautiful lobby but rooms need help,Stayed here for second time recently. Gorgeous lobby. Friendly staff. Good free shuttle service. Our room this time was disappointing. King bed in too small space so that one side did not even have a lamp. Also the heating/cooling unit was right next to the bed and very noisy so we turned it off. Luckily it was not needed. Room...

Hotel Phillips,5,Hotel's 1920s charm and elegance remain fresh,"My husband and I always try to stay at the Hotel Phillips when we are in Kansas City. It is our favorite hotel and we have stayed at many. I feel at home there and the staff has always been exceptional, although we are not particularly demanding guests. Over the years we have probably spent at least 20 nights there.... More"
Hotel Phillips,4,Excellent stay,"Just stayed one night but very happy. Nice, comfortable top floor room. Staff could not have been more helpful. Great location right by the Power Light district. Be prepared to pay for valet parking. Price of this was Offset though by free wine and cheese reception."
The Inn at Solvang,5,"Thank you, Garth Brooks!","Everything was sold out in State College for Garth's concerts and the Inn came up as available...what an amazing find!! I'll be making the drive now each visit, just to stay there! The Inn is wonderfully decorated and I so enjoyed browsing all the books. Breakfast was amazing each morning. Thank you Stephanie and team!!"
Econolodge,5,Extended stay,I work here in Perry about 6 days out of the week. The People here are very friendly and willing to make your stay better. The hotel is great for my simple needs as I'm away from home. The rooms and hallways smell very clean each time I enter and leave. I will continue my business here for sure.
Hotel Zelos,5,"Convenient, cute and moderately comfrotable","The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again."
Hotel Zelos,4,Perfectly fine hotel for a visit to SF,"excellent location near convention center. friendly, willing staff. not a true luxury hotel in terms of the room I received, but a comfortable clean room, I didn't really need any more than that. After all you're here to visit San Francisco, not the hotel."
Hotel Zelos,5,Great Staff!,"Hotel Zelos was a great place to stay in San Francisco. The staff is definitely the highlight of the hotel. The hotel itself is great: clean, well decorated, etc, but the people who work there were very helpful and friendly. The location is great being right next to the Powell BART station but the neighborhood is under construction. This obviously isn't the fault of the hotel and won't impact your stay. We couldn't hear any of the construction, but it makes it a little more difficult to get around. Overall, I definitely recommend Hotel Zelos!"
Hotel Zelos,3,"Not so good, not so bad","Pros: the location is awesome, the room size is great, the bathroom is nice also with a nice tub. Bad: the style and furniture starts to get really old, no breakfast despite the high price, the price is high, nothing exeptionnal... We were 4 people and so 4 reservations. Unfortunately one was missing. It was 1am so very bad surprise.... More"
EconoLodge,1,DO NOT stay here!!!!!!!!!!!,After getting the bait and switch I decided I'd rather stay anywhere else. I'm sure I wasnt missing much as it looks like project style crack house apartments. The front desk (old middle eastern lady) was extremely rude and up charged me 50 when I got there! I travel and stay in hotels 250 days/ year and trust me this... More
EconoLodge,1,Filthy hotel and crooked people who own it!,"We had no choice but to stay here when a tornado hit the area and most of Vineland was without power. They charged us 190 for one night, wouldn't accept my AAA card and after leaving, we found out, we had been charged for 4 cats (which we don't own) and for another person. It was only my husband and... More"
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,4,THE DC TRIP,"Hotel is in the perfect spot at the perfect price with the not so perfect view. Expedia rep said that it was facing the water and in a way it was but at a 45 degree angel past the parking lot and a few other obstructions. You have to stretch your neck at the furthest corner of the window to gain a peak. But it was still good though. The room sleeps like nobody's business. Once your head hits the pillows its light out. What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!"
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Nice location,Excellent experience. Will come again and book stay in the future
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,2,Hampton Inn,"heat in room did not work properly, tv remote was broken excessive noise"
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Gracious and helpful staff,"Even though we were having problems, i.e. Feather allergy, Flat tire, key not working...the front desk personell were always gracious and helpful."
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,4,"beautiful, convenient location","Brand new hotel in brand new retail area on the water. Easy to access off the beltway. Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds. Only complaint is that the full offering of the Hampton Inn breakfast was not available at the two times we came down (at 7am and 9am on a Saturday). The food at 9am had been in the bin too long. Still more choices than the continental breakfast at other places, including make-you-own waffles and yummy egg burritos. The fee for parking in the community garage was free with room key and even included a convenient room key drop upon final exit. Pool but no hot tub."
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,great!!!!!!,It was a great stay
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,4,Awesome Stay,"My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!"
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Reasonable price for exceptional hotel,Free breakfast! Attentive staff Fantastic location
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Excellent!,"Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service."
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Great Room,The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,4,GREAT LOCATION,THE LOCATION OF THE HOTEL WAS OUTSTANDING. BUT THERE IS AND ADDITIONAL COST FOR PARKING JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND . IF YOU PAY FOR PARKING AT THE TIME YOU CHECK - IN BE SURE TO HAVE IT OUT BEFORE 1 PM THE NEXT DAY
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,4,great stay,"was too quick, but very nice area"
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,4,Best,"clean, good area, very kind crew, easy to park"
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,4,Easter Get Away,We had a great overnight trip to the National Harbor near DC. All of the sites and entertainment were within walking distance!
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Hampton inn,I loved my stay VIP service all the way. I didn't want to leave. I can honestly say I will visit again. I give it 5 stars
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Overall it was good but AC sucks!!,"The only problem I have was their sensorize INNCOM thermostat for air conditioning unit to start-up. If there are not movement inside the room, it will not kick in..... sucks!! the trick is, you have to keep moving while sleeping to keep the AC running (LOL)...."
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Extremely comfortable,"Convenient and comfortable. Staff is great, breakfast and WiFi is a bonus."
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,3,TV sucks,I was really disappointed with the TV service. Very few channels and poor quality.
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Will definately stay there again,"Awesome, Overall"
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Great conference stay,Better with more extras like breakfast. Preferred place to sleep for conference.
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,4,Nice,Very good experience. Staff was great. Enjoyed my times especially after my previous fiasco at that other hotel.
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,More than Expected,"The hotel is located near all the attractions on the Harbor. We were provided more than we expected. There was parking right across the street restaurants within 5 minute walking distance and most of all hot and cold continental breakfast in the morning and hot coffee and tea available all day in the lobby. The rooms were very comfortable. I slept just like I was at home. Oh, I can't forget the staff: they were on their job with an attitude of excellence!"
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Conference stay,"Repeat trip to this hotel for national conference attendance. Provides a quality stay, business center kept me in touch and great value for limited travel budget."
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Amazing!,I can't comment on the breakfast because we slept through it but everything else was excellent! I dont know why anyone would pay twice the price to stay at the Gaylord. 5 stars all the way!
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Happy in Texas.,Our room was a bit small. There was no microwave in the room. Location was more for couples than for family. The room itself And service were excellent.
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,"Great staff, great breakfast, great experience","This hotel is a peach. The staff are friendly, the hot breakfast filling and the rooms are immaculate. This should be a poster child for how to run a hotel."
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Great hotel,"Hampton Inn never disappoints. Always an affordable, clean hotel with attentive and friendly staff. The breakfast is always a plus too. Also, the National Harbor is a nice area full of shops and dining choices and seems to be a family friendly hangout destination for locals."
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,4,Good hotel,I stayed here with some friends for a convention. It was a good room and the free breakfast was nice.
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,Affordable premium lodging,"The hotel offers comfortable, somewhat elegant rooms but I suppose I was more impressed with the personnel and the warmth you get interacting with them. But for my phone call bills which seemed a bit high, my stay overall was great."
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,5,"Friendly staff, large clean room.","We were there for 3 nights and used it as a staging area for sightseeing in DC and Baltimore. It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast. Parking was 13/day and right across the street, which is quite reasonable for the DC area."
Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,4,Good place to Stay,"Reasonable rates with free breakfast and right in front of Gaylord National Resort worked for me very well. The rooms have good size bathrooms and the air conditioning in the rooms was excellent. Parking is 11 per day and that is why I did not give it 5 stars. However, at National Harbor 11 is not bad especially when Gaylord charges double of it per day."
Fairmont Grand Del Mar,5,Hosted Client Event,"We hosted our annual Client Event at The Grand Del Mar and it was excellent!! The service, property, rooms, restaurants, and GOLF absolutely magnificent.

Fairmont Grand Del Mar,4,A nice getaway for a price,We drove down for a weekend getaway and to celebrate a special birthday. Our infant son accompanied us.

Fairmont Grand Del Mar,5,Wonderful quiet resort,The resort and staff are wonderful. The hotel is very nice and the groups are beautiful. The location is secluded so you need a rental car or to book the house car in advance. The concierge staff has not been to most of the spots so use trip advisor to help find the right places.
Fairmont Grand Del Mar,4,It Almost Lives Up To Its Rating,"This is a very, very, very good hotel. My expectations were high because of the reviews I had read and it didn't quite meet my expectations. I know I'm knit-picking but while the abundance of fresh flower petals in my room were very nice I would gladly have traded them for a room service breakfast with hot coffee, hot ham... More"

Virgin Hotels Chicago,5,Awesome hotel.,"Awesome hotel. Virgin really took the time to figure out all things at are frustrating about staying in a hotel and fixed them - kudos!!! The hotel will become a regular haunt in the future. From free wifi, free cocktails, a mini bar you're not terrified to touch, not to mention the no check out time, they really are way ahead of the rest. Oh by the way did I mention the really cool room... Awesome! Highly recommend the hotel. From young teens to my parents in their 70's the hotel met our every need."
Virgin Hotels Chicago,4.8,Impeccable customer service overall experience,"Bad: The bed wasn't that comfy, which was surprising given all of the other amazing details. Sheets were rough/stiff- not cozy. Could be easily fixed, though!. Good: This was by far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. Check-in and check-out was super fast, staff was phenomenal, and the room was very intuitively set-up with thoughtful details technology. It was clear that Virgin isn't just a typical hotel. The chamber set-up of the room allowed for privacy comfort, even in a relatively small space. Snacks mini-bar had 7-11 prices. Everything was super clean, well serviced and wonderful. In short: STAY HERE!"
Virgin Hotels Chicago,4.6,"Very comfy beds, great lobby/bathroom","Bad: Noisy in lower floors, but not at all at higher ones. Good: Very comfy beds, great lobby/bathroom"
Virgin Hotels Chicago,4.6,Staff went out of their way after checkout to locate an item...,Good: Staff went out of their way after checkout to locate an item I had left in the room. The room had already been cleaned and the staff got the item back to me as quickly as possible. Roof top bar was beautiful.
Virgin Hotels Chicago,4.8,"Great city location, very clean and modern hotel with good staff . Don't miss the happy hour","Bad: A little bit of noise from the 'L' down below, but then again that is part of the character of the city. Good: Overall cleanliness, new feel, friendly efficient staff, great happy hour! Excellent location."
Virgin Hotels Chicago,3.55,Good hotel terrible room rate!,Bad: The room rate was terrible we had a Booking.com rate that was not honoured it soured the stay and was a big difference. We to date have no explanation!. Good: Location
Virgin Hotels Chicago,4.4,Comfortable hotel in a great location.,Bad: Had a couple of glitches getting the room serviced but otherwise very friendly and helpful staff. Good: Great location. Nice rooms with exceptionally comfortable bed.
Virgin Hotels Chicago,5,A fun place to stay with great staff and lots going on in...,Good: A fun place to stay with great staff and lots going on in and around the hotel.
Virgin Hotels Chicago,4.6,Honestly one of the best stays I've ever had (and I travel a lot!),Would be nice if the duvet were in a duvet cover as I just get tangled between the flat sheets and the comforter Gym could really do with some more variety in terms of machinery - Its impossible to do much leg work as there is no squat rack with a bar - or even a smith machine which has multiple purposes Super helpful staff 24/7 - very accommodating of my unusual hours Room service menu is amazing Views are amazing Cerise Bar on the roof is epic and the bartenders are amazing I will be coming back and SOON!
Virgin Hotels Chicago,5,Beautiful hotel and great value,Bad: The hotel is next to train tracks so there is some noise from that pretty often but it's really not so bad and you kind of have to expect some noise when you're staying at a hotel that's literally in the middle of the city. Good: Very tech friendly as the hotel has its own smartphone app which allows you to order room service and control the thermostat among other things. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is designed very well. Also the price of the mini bar items are actually reasonable.
Virgin Hotels Chicago,5,PERFECTION,Bad: Loved everything about Virgin Hotel. Good: First and foremost the staff - just wonderful. Friendly and very patient with all the enquiries we made! And we were there for the historic parade to celebrate the Chicago Cubs World Series win and the icing on the cake was another historic win - Ireland beating the All Blacks after 111 years!
Virgin Hotels Chicago,5,"Fun, Funky Energy to a Shiny New Hotel","Bad: A little sticker shock with 65/night valet parking, but I hadn't done my research for cheaper options, so not a big deal. Good: Super hip and definitely a young techy vibe, but everyone was friendly and helpful. Room was as described and very spacious for the location and price. Even though it is right at the corner of the L Tracks, sound wasn't a problem. Exactly what was needed!"
Virgin Hotels Chicago,5,Fun place and great staff,"Bad: Everything was great. Good: Superior experience. Loved everything about this hotel. Very comfortable, well thought out and fun arrangement of the room, great shower and products, good restaurants, wonderful roof bar. Looking forward to the next visit!"
Virgin Hotels Chicago,4.8,Cool hotel in a perfect location,"Bad: We were on the 9th floor and slept really well but could hear the metro. Earplugs are supplied which were useful to my husband. There were two tvs in our one bedroom suite but only one remote control - odd when we wanted to watch two different shows. Good: Absolutely perfect location in Chicago, within one block of the metro, walking distance to most of the top areas to visit and very good restaurants. Very comfortable room and bed, neat layout for the closet and vanity, wonderful shower, cool design features (Vespa chair, red fridge, furniture)."
Virgin Hotels Chicago,4.8,Great location and staff,"Bad: Intermittent barking dog!. Good: Spacious suite, recommend end room on high floor"
Virgin Hotels Chicago,5,I thought flying Virgin was great.... this exceeded my expectations,"Good: The suite was very well apointed, plenty of room for an inroom breakfast --the bed and bedding were very nice. The staff couldnt be nicer We had a great night on the rooftop deck.... we never left the propertysmall plates a DJ and wonderful views. Ill be back"
Virgin Hotels Chicago,4.8,Excellent stay -- I will return,"Bad: A very minor quibble: only one side of the bed had a nightstand. Good: Room design was well thought out and executed, making an average-sized space especially user-friendly for a couple. Also, the room had more power outlets than I've ever seen in a hotel room. Staff was helpful and friendly, second-floor bar was very nice."
Virgin Hotels Chicago,5,Everything,Bad: The view. Good: Everything
Virgin Hotels Chicago,5,Exceptional hotel,"Beds were very comfortable, room amenities perfect. Enjoyed the lobby level coffee shop, roof top bar and happy hour on the 2nd level every evening. A great bonus!"
The Boxer,4.6,Great location to attend a hockey game!,"Bad: Timing seemed to be off. Had to wait a very long time for breakfast, longer than people who had come in after us. Had to wait a very long time for the valet to bring our car, seemed to be some kind of communication issue. They were nice about it, and so were we, but it seemed to be a theme, which was a bit of a disappointment. Good: Nicely appointed room, great location."
The Boxer,4.8,I loved the quirkiness and style of the hotel.,"Good: I loved the quirkiness and style of the hotel. The staff were so friendly and accommodating. The drinks at the bar were top notch and the price for the location was unbeatable. And the bed, the bed was perfect. I slept like a baby."
The Boxer,4.15,Clean and cozy,Bad: I was supposed to get a room with two beds and ended up with a room with one full bed for me and my husband.it was very small!.
The Boxer,2.5,Poor hotel option. More like a poor 3 star.,Staff weren't helpful and no one tried to come and clean our room on several nights. Rooms were very small. Good location
The Boxer,3.95,Location to the garden,Bad: Cost of the valet. Good: Location to the garden
The Boxer,4.6,Complete and good,"Bad: (Valet) parking is expensive. Room was a bit small. Good: Very pleasant experience. The room was good, clean and had a rich minibar. Very nice bar/restaurant/breakfast accomodation. Personell (we were helped by luckas) was extraordinary kind and helpful."
The Boxer,5,Perfect,Good: Beautiful rooms and amenities - L'occitane products. The restaurant Finch great food and amazing bar. Loved the Boxer
The Boxer,5,Dont look past The Boxer for Boston accommodation.,Great location. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Wonderful friendly staff.
The Boxer,5,Great location for a reasonable price in Boston.,"Good: The room was very comfortable, great for a couple. We had a wonderful time, it was very conveniently located to the TD Garden, which is where we were attending a concert. It was also very close to the North End and Faneuil hall, which is a great area to visit for food options that are very plentiful."
The Boxer,2.9,nice place but way overpriced,the breakfast at 17 bucks was a bit of disgrace. it is a particular building.
The Boxer,2.9,The Boxer Boston a let down and should have been better!,"Bad: We had booked 2 rooms for our 3 night Boston trip - King Room for us and a Double Double (ie with 2 double beds) for our teenagers. I booked this in December for our July visit. I emailed twice before arrival to request that the rooms were close by (on the same floor) and both times got no reply - and that should have alerted me and to be honest sums up 'Boxer Customer Service'. On arrival we were told that there were no rooms available with 2 beds, the guy on reception seemed clueless how to help us. Our teenagers were supposedly 'upgraded' to a suite where my son had to sleep on a sofa / pull out bed (or share a King size bed with his sister). Totally unacceptable - I booked these rooms 6 months in advance. All in all we had interactions with 4 different staff members (including someone from Accounts who had to process a compensation refund) and at no time did either my wife nor I feel like the Customer . . . . you know the kind The PAYING Customer! So in terms of Comfort score - low because my son was on a sofa bed for 3 nights. In terms of Value for Money - low 1800 and my 16 year old son gets a sofa bed In terms of Staff score - low because they are in serious need of some Customer Service training. Good: The Boxer in Boston SHOULD be a fantastic hotel - it's a great building, location is excellent (we were able to explore everything that Boston has to offer from there), rooms are a good size but overall our stay was not as good as it should have been. Came away from our 3 night stay (planned and booked 6 months earlier) just feeling like we had been let down . . . ."
The Boxer,4,poor room comfort,Bad: poor room comfort no room for clothes very old bath accesories high price.
The Boxer,5,The whole 5 day experience at the hotel was superb- the...,"Good: The whole 5 day experience at the hotel was superb- the room,staff and location were all perfect- thank you The Boxer second time staying with you and all requirements were met."
The Boxer,5,The location,The location
The Boxer,5,Close to TD Garden,Bad: Parking a little expensive.. Good: Close to TD Garden
The Boxer,3.35,Good location.,Fitness center small and not well equipped. Good location.
The Boxer,5,The coolest hotel! Everything is excellent,Bad: Nothing. Good: The hotel was simply excellent. The coolest hotel I have ever stayed!
The Boxer,4.6,They were very accommodating. They offer a free breakfast buffet which was a nice surprise.,"I didn't like the size of the rooms, not as big as I thought they would be. I liked the central location to Downtown Boston."
The Boxer,5,IN THE HEART OF BOSTON...'cause they got heart!,"Good: Very quaint hotel, good location, great staff...amazing time!"
The Boxer,3.75,Good but not great.,"Bad: We had breakfast on two days in the hotel. One day (Sunday) the service was great - the next day it was very poor. While the hotel is quite central, the choice of restaurants very close to the hotel is not good. Good: Front desk staff were friendly and happy to give advice etc. Nice hotel with funky rooms. Room we had was a bit noisy at night - can turn the fridge off but still noise from air con or something else."
The Boxer,5,We enjoyed the convenience of staying here while we attended a concert at the Boston Garden.,Bad: This is really not a reflection on the hotel but the valet parking does take a long time to retrieve your car. They tell you to allow 30 minutes and you really need to do that. Good: Friendly staff. Clean rooms.
The Boxer,4.6,Friendly and prompt service.,Bad: Paying for parking. Good: Friendly and prompt service.
The Boxer,5,More please,"Good: Perfection - beautiful rooms, comfortable beds, great style. Centrally located for all the fun things in downtown Boston."
The Boxer,5,Made the trip even better bookending the day at the hotel.,"Good: The hotel environment, the staff went above and beyond to make our first trip to Boston better than we expected. Recommendations they made, help with directions, very friendly, didnt feel like a hotel, felt like staying with friends. Comfortable beds, cozy room, great food."
The Boxer,3.75,Great place to stay while taking in an event at TD garden,Bad: Room size. Good: The close proximity to TD garden
The Boxer,3.95,Free apples and fruit Infused Water in the lobby.,Bad: Room was small. Good: Free apples and fruit Infused Water in the lobby. Free bikes.

The Boxer,3.55,Free water and apples,Bad: Room too small and ice machine broke nice too small rooms. Good: Free water and apples
The Boxer,4.6,"Location, staff, aesthetics, price.","Bad: The pillows were very flat and uncomfortable, and there was no real blanket on the bed!. Good: Location, staff, aesthetics, price."
The Boxer,4.6,We were happy to stay there for a weekend in Boston. The location and amenities worked well for us.,"Bad: I think the hotel could do more to promote the on site restaurant with newly arrived guests. My husband tried it and thought the food was great but if there'd been a deal or something to catch our attention I'm sure we'd have eaten breakfast there both mornings of our stay. I also think that although the space inside the rooms seems to be well used that there are some practical challenges with storage where existing space could be better used for the ease and comfort of guests. Good: Very comfortable beds. Not massive but cosy and we all slept well. The linens were clean and fresh and we enjoyed the L'Occitane products in the bathroom. The staff were friendly, kind and helpful."
The Boxer,3.75,The staff were friendly and helpful.,Bad: The room lacked hanging space and was quite small. Good: The staff were friendly and helpful. The bar and restaurant were nice
The Boxer,4.15,A quirky and comfortable place,"Bad: The minibar and the heating were noisy, but it didn't really disrupt our sleep. Breakfast was good, but perhaps the avocado toast was a bit small for the price. Good: The staff were all friendly and professional. Our room was clean and warm (it was cold out!) and had everything we needed. The drinks and food were very good, especially the Finch burger and the crab bennies at breakfast. Overall, we really liked the feel of the hotel and would definitely stay again, especially if we were going out of North Station again which is just around the corner."
The Boxer,4.4,Had a wonderful time exploring the whole north end of the city on foot from this awesome location!,Good: The location was perfect for walking to everything
The Boxer,3.55,Very friendly staff.,"Bad: Shower didn't drain propery, was puddle in shower when we checked in. Someone else's shower water left over, very gross. Good: Very friendly staff."
The Boxer,4.8,Great hotel.,Bad: Room servicing late in the day. Good: Great hotel. Friendly staff.
The Boxer,4.8,I will stay there again!,Nothing Very friendly staff and very helpful
The Boxer,2.5,Restaurant closed,Bad: The restaurant was closed for a refurb and as a result we had to eat our breakfast in the lobby on our knees. We had tiny plastic plates and plastic cutlery and a poor food choice . I was not informed by booking.com that this was the case . It was not the service we wanted for 675 dollars for 2 nights!!. Good: The room was good
The Boxer,3.95,"nice hotel, well located near the Boston public market","Bad: the room was not very big and a couple more hooks here and there would have been nice to hang coat, towels etc. Good: nice decoration, well located"
The Boxer,2.9,At least it wasnt too far from TD garden.,Bad: Just want to say paying 330 for one night would have been nice too get breakfast included in the price. . Good: At least it wasnt too far from TD garden.
The Boxer,4.15,It was great,The bed was uncomfortable It was close walking distance to everything
The Boxer,4.8,"Staff was great, room small but clean and organized well.","Good: Staff was great, room small but clean and organized well. Location to TD Garden and restaurants awesome."
The Boxer,4.4,Perfect location if you're attending an even at the...,Good: Perfect location if you're attending an even at the Garden. Very short walk
The Boxer,5,Dont look past The Boxer for Boston accommodation.,Good: Great location. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Wonderful friendly staff.
The Boxer,4.4,Quirky and fun hotel.,Bad: The bed platforms! Perhaps if they were painted white they would become part of the bed and maybe missed a little more! They are now the colour of the carpet - beware!. Good: The staff! Very helpful and welcoming and happy! Loved the L'octaine toiletries. Free bikes were a good idea too but it rained during my visit.
The Boxer,4.15,Buffet food,Bad: Buffet food.
The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,5,Hotel with Personality!,"Loved this place! If you are looking for a chain hotel, THIS IS NOT for you. If you are looking for different, unique, friendly, fun...then this is it. We chose the little room with Queen bed, no windows..and it was GREAT. Best bed I've slept in while traveling in a long long time. Although there are internal hotel noises every once and a while..it was by no means disturbing or loud. Location was awesome! We mainly hung out on Decatour street/Jackson square/French market..but even bourbon street was a short walk. Hotel staff is very knowledgeable about places to eat and things to do. We didn't drive here so no idea about parking or valet. Staff was extremely friendly. It's just a super little gem in a crazy town."
The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,5,What a great experience!,"Great hotel. So much more character than staying in one of the big chain hotels. The building was a transformed warehouse, so walls are old brick, floors are resurfaced wood, etc. Very Cool. Super helpful staff. Great coffee shop restaurant downstairs. Definitely will return."
The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,5,Great hotel!,Nice hotel with a great restaurant! Only thing that would have been nice to have it a bathtub rather than just a shower.
The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,5,"Friendly, helpful staff and comfortable rooms!","Pros- Great customer service, comfortable beds, clean rooms, fantastic room style/decor and safe area. Cons- no pool, no meals available, just a few pastry type items at the bar/lobby"
The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,5,As Local As You Can Get,"The young, hip hotel guests probaby cringed when they saw me schlep my 4, 6, and 8 year olds through the front door and I immediately realized our family was not the hotel's target demographic, but we LOVED this place. As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect."
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,4.4,Value for Money,"Bad: Better return from the slots!!. Good: Bed excellent, pillows good, shower good with strong flow and hot. Very well maintained public spaces with lots of wood panelling. The piece of the Berlin Wall was quite interesting and all at a very good price."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.1,Never again!,Bad: Thumping music all night long. So loud the windows vibrated.
Fremont Hotel & Casino,5,Excellent,Bad: Losing money lol. Good: I like the attitude and service from the staff...i enjoy the atmosphere and the food
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.95,The staff at the place is extremely friendly.,"Good: The staff at the place is extremely friendly.Paradise Restaurant buffet good selection, good food, and reasonable cost."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,1.65,Non-smoker had to sleep in a smoking room,"Bad: The room I booked was a non-smoking but when we got to the hotel, the gentleman at the counter said they didn't have any and have not had any available for several days. The guy then said that in order for me to get my money back, I'd have to go through the third party that I booked the room through. Good: Nothing"
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,3.95,EVERYTHING WORK OUT JUST FINE,Good: HELPFUL STAFF
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.55,Great stay. Little pricey for the location. No post season MLB access in my room!!! Dodgers and Cubs,Bad: That the tv would not switch to the input channel. I wasn't able to use the HDMI port on the TV. Good: The company I had with me. Lol
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,5,Best gambling in Vegas and best comps!,"Good: Best gambling in Vegas and best comps! Brewery is great, rooms very clean, staff is wonderful. I only stay at Main Street."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,5,I absolutely loved it and will definitely be back in the near future!,Bad: I still really hate the cigarette smoke in the casino. But other then that (and all the crazies on the fremont experience at night) its fun and awesome!. Good: Location was perfect for our leisure trip. Free valet parking is always amazing (of course we tipped every time we picked up and dropped off our car!) The amount of things to do on the Fremont Experience is endless! What an awesome experience. Truly the 9th island for Hawaiians like us! We love it!
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.5,NIGHT MARE!!!,"Bad: 1st - PARKING LOT **BAD,BAD,BAD** This is 2017, nobody need driver to parking car, unless you're 85 yrs old (should not even drive). But drivers that steals quarters from your rental car, this is very low. 2nd - They asked a deposit of 100. Because I was planning to get it back, I used a BC and not a CC. On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway. The noise of that machine it's worst than sleep on LV international airport at 9am with your windows car open. Will I stay on this hotel again NEVER. Good: Location, access to shopping, and cleanning"
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.9,Cheap and this is it,"Bad: Dirty and old room. Valet parking is not comfortable. Casino is old and has no roulette. If you have a car, you can stay, cause the price is everything. Good: Pretty cheap for Las Vegas"
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.9,Need the minimum for an inexpensive price - this is the deal for you!,"Bad: The hotel is very tired - could use an update. Now, I understand why such a deal. Can not figure out higher rating given to it overall. Good: Location was in the middle of the Freemont Experience."
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,5,We'll be back.,"Bad: Not much. Good: For several years, a group of us has met for the SEMA SHOW. We have always come over a day early, and met for fun and dinner at your 777 Microbrewery. This time we were booked at MAIN STREET STATION as well.We'll be back, particularly since you didn't charge resort fees."
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,4.15,We'll be back again,Bad: Check out was too slow. Good: Buffet was excellent
Fremont Hotel & Casino,4.6,Definitely coming back!,"Bad: To be honest, nothing to complain about. Just too bad that there wasn't any free wifi in the rooms. Good: Considering that we only paid 88 dollars for 2 persons for 2 nights, this was great value for money. The hotel is located in the middle of Fremont Street, so you just step outside and you are in the middle of the action. Our room was on the 9th floor and we didn't hear any noise whatsoever. The room was maybe a bit old fashioned, but still offered everything you need. We were positively surprised that we had access to the pool and gym of the California hotel. We just needed to walk 2 mins to access their facilities. The gym was really good equipped for a hotel gym. Pool was really nice and quiet. Would definitely stay here again!"
Fremont Hotel & Casino,1.65,Bed bug city,Bad: This room is straight out of a horror film. Good: I like Fremont st
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,5,It's my favorite place go I've booked for November for my birthday this year.,"Bad: nothing!. Good: buffet is excellant! room are clean, great view of mountains and saw fireworks in distance."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,4.4,the location,Bad: access to parking. Good: the location
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,5,Very satisfied,Bad: Very satisfied.
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.5,Its was alright for what it was worth.,"Bad: The place was falling apart, the tub was cracked and broken. the bathroom shelf was barely holding on. The bed was extremely tough to sleep on. Good: I liked that it was close to entertainment. The shower held a hot water temperature for a long time."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.75,"Location, beds, price","Bad: Bathroom was small, noisy outside. Good: Location, beds, price"
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.9,Pro: Cheap Con: everything else,"Bad: The parking garage is so hard to find. I passed it at least two times trying to find it. You also can't self park, which is a hassle coming back from being out and about. You have to rush to gather all of your belongings, souvenirs, etc, because the entry bay to the garage will hold two cars at most. You can't dilly dally. Hope that makes sense. Only paid WiFi,which was a big bummer. The express snack bar/grill staff were very unfriendly. Every time I went to the buffet, the line to be seated was always sooo long. I never did end up eating there for that reason. Good: Near all of the Fremont Street Experience stuff."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.5,Take a gamble,"Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,4.4,It met all of our needs and had a great time in and around the surrounding casino's,Bad: smokey air out of elevators. Good: valet parking with security-
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.55,Location,Bad: Not sure about deluxe room i was in. Good: Location
Fremont Hotel & Casino,4.15,Great,Good: Close proximity to Freemont Street Experience.
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,3.75,excellent value for money in las vegas,Bad: missed not having a pool or somewhere to sit out and read. we were next to the railway so the train was noisy but we got used to it. Good: loved the food. beds very comfortable. excellent value.
Fremont Hotel & Casino,5,Lots of fun,Bad: I lost roulette. Good: Buffet bb
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.55,The Beds were great!,"Bad: The bathroom needs to be upgraded. It is very worn, the brown wall paper was dirty and the paint on the sink counter was pealing off. was also disappointed the room did not have a coffee maker. I like to have a cup while I get dressed in the mornings. would have liked a non-smoking area in the casino. I am a non-smoker and I had to keep taking breaks and go outside for fresh air. Good: The Beds were great! The location was very good. The gentleman at the Registration desk was very helpful and friendly. And the Lady at the Keno lounge was nice too."
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,3.75,The beds were very confortable.,"Bad: Not so quiet during the night, since it's really close to highway. Good: The beds were very confortable. The parking was for free, and the location close the Fremont street."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.9,"I really liked its location, and slot machines, the Paradise...","Bad: The beds were not too comfortable. Good: I really liked its location, and slot machines, the Paradise Buffet, and Duncan Donuts place within the Fremont Hotel."
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,5,Excellence - and without a resort fee!,"Bad: The elevator to the parkade requires some maintenance - at least a wet mop to kill whatever is lurking on the floor!. Good: This resort hotel is amazing - the location in perfect, the rooms are huge, and absolutely spotless!"
Fremont Hotel & Casino,4.6,The free parking at the hotel was great and all the staff...,Bad: Limited TV channels and no refrigerator or coffee making facility in room. Good: The free parking at the hotel was great and all the staff were very helpful and polite.
Fremont Hotel & Casino,4.15,Good stay,Bad: Small restroom. Good: Clean room with a great view.
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.15,Valet parking Duncan doughnut,Bad: Even though we got a non smoking room it still smelled like smoke. Good: Valet parking Duncan doughnut
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.55,"Nice to stay, but needs to be improved.","Bad: The hotel bathroom should be remodeled as the bathtub looks quite old. The drain gets clogged easily, and the basin tap handle looks like it is about to fall apart. No free WiFi. No fridge. And even no coffee-maker/kettle. Good: Good location with a few minutes walk to the Mob museum. The hotel is located in the heart of Fremont Experience. Both northbound and southbound bus stops are just beside the hotel building. Besides, the staffs are quite friendly. The buffet was satisfactory, and the price is cheap due to the 10 off for guests every meal."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.7,It was a beautiful hotal,Bad: It was hard to get into the parking area because of traffic (an event was going on) no coffee pot in the room. I like to sit and drink coffee for and hour or so before doing anything for the day. I'm not paying 3.00 per cup of coffee. Other than that it was ok. Good: It was a beautiful hotal
Fremont Hotel & Casino,4.15,Great location!,Bad: Nothing. Good: Location on Fremont
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.1,"Rooms small, air conditioning don't work!","Bad: Rooms small, air conditioning don't work!!."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,4.15,Location and price.,"Bad: Old, not many outlets. Good: Location and price."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.9,A great part of history that needs minor changes to keep up.,Bad: No business center..wifi wasnt free..it asked for ten bucks...the internet kiosk was 650 for 30 mins..but deducted 20 mins to print boarding passes and no shuttle to airport. Good: Location
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.35,Money worth but looking old and noisy,"Bad: I was in room 314, and its very noisy at night with the street ambiance, so dont expect to sleep before 2AM. I had to take my breakfast to adjacent hotels as continental / seated proper breakfast was not available (or couldnt find it...). Good: The bed was confortable and the location is just amazing on Fremont street."
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,4.8,Hotel and Staff -- GREAT. Parking: VERY BAD.,"Bad: Main Street Station recently implemented paid parking (I stayed last week and it was still free). Although parking is free for hotel guests, they have not worked the kinks out of the system. We almost missed our flight due to being unable to leave the lot. Security had to be called and that person told us that there have been a large number of similar episodes. They need to FIX this!. Good: Everything EXCEPT the parking."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,1.65,none,Bad: none.
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,3.55,"The breakfast buffett was good, the other 2 restaurants were...","Bad: Th e food wasnt that good. Good: The breakfast buffett was good, the other 2 restaurants were just fair, in fact in one of them I got sick with the food."
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,4.6,"The rooms were very comfortable, clean, and well maintained","Good: The rooms were very comfortable, clean, and well maintained"
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,4.6,Stayed here for a week and our stay was great! We will definitely come back again for vacation.,Bad: There's nothing not to like here. Though the maid service was good but they are kind of early to knock at the door for cleaning service. They're there at 8am and we were still in dreamland that we were forced to get up and open the door to talk to them to clean later. Good: We love our very spacious room though we didn't have a single king sized bed. They gave us twin beds but it's fine. The Garden court buffet was also great! It was very affordable. We almost eat there everyday because of its price. Please keep it that way.
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.7,It was ok.,"Bad: The airconditioner in the room did not work, and it made a very loud sound all night. We told the front desk and they were able to fix it for the next night stay. It's understandable because the hotel itself is very old. We would probably stay in a different hotel when we go back. Good: Staff was very helpful and nice. Tony Romo's restaurant was very good."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.75,Room was clean.,Bad: Bed was not comfortable - they need to replace the mattress. Good: Room was clean.
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.9,It was on my bucket list and I wanted to...,"Bad: The entire place smells like an ashtray. The rooms were small and the place is noisy. It's a complete freak show under the canopy---ugly people who are 90 nude with no talent. Wall to wall beggars and hawkers. The entire Las Vegas is full of annoying street hustlers and creeps. What a waste of our First Amendment Rights! Next time I go to LV, I will stay in a South Vegas Hotel, go to a show and leave the next day. Too bad Vegas is stuck with such a beggar and homeless problem. Good: It was on my bucket list and I wanted to experience the canopy light show---ok, check it off. Good deals on food: Tony Roma's is located within the Fremont Hotel and steak and lobster for 11.99 is a DEAL! The Valet Parking was free and excellent. The entire Staff was excellent but seemed embarrassed to be in such a dump. It was cheap but you pay for it if your not a smoker."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,2.9,Overall the stay was just okay but way over priced for the accomandations.,"Bad: The bathroom is very small, smaller than I am used to. The saimin noodle soup at the cafe was terrible, the noodles were mushy and blend. Good: Location was right. The buffet was so so. The food at the cafe was okay. The rooms are kind of small but okay."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,5,Loved It!!!,Bad: The pool was not at the hotel had to go to another hotel to swim and that is not stated when your booking your room. Just make it clear that there is not a pool at the hotel other than that loved the hotel!. Good: Great place to stay
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,3.15,cheap buffet with good quality,"Bad: in old town, far away from new main strip noisy air-con in room decor abit old. Good: cheap buffet with good quality big room comfort bed"
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.95,"Easy access to Fremont, hope you like valet parking.","Bad: The bed was stiff and valet parking only. Wifi is pay only and didn't live up to the speed expectations as advertised. Good: The location is great, easy access to all of Fremont area with a short walk. Not being a giant casino you don't have to walk far from the car or through the place to get out."
Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,3.55,"The hotel was very nice, much nicer than The Plaza next door.","Bad: Extremely disappointed in Fremont Street. It used to be my favorite place to play/stay in Vegas but I will not be back. Very strange people just standing in the middle of the street. Cartoon characters, men in thongs and even one in an adult diaper! It's Hollywood Blvd on steroids! Thanks for the memories, Downtown Las Vegas. The Fremont Street Experience is one I do not wish to repeat!. Good: The hotel was very nice, much nicer than The Plaza next door."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.55,Excelent location in the freemont Experience.,Bad: My room was near the ventilation system and there was a lot a noise coming from that. Good: Excelent location in the freemont Experience.
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.95,A moment to relax.,Bad: There were a couple younger staff at the desk during mid day times that seemed bothered by questions. Good: Easy to park. The room was clean and cool. Valet staff was really nice. Steve the maintence man was amazing. I dropped my pearl earring down the bathroom sink. He took the time to take the loop of the drain and get my pearl earring back. I was grateful for his extra service and care.
Fremont Hotel & Casino,4.15,Not bad if you get the right price.,Bad: Waitress didn't come around a lot even with tipping. The hotel was older and had some cosmetic problems. Good: Lots to around the property and decent food prices. The buffet was really good.
Fremont Hotel & Casino,4.6,Love the Fremont Hotel,Bad: When we left there was a valet parking worker that made us put are luggage on the cart. But other than we had an awsome time there. Good: The location and the restaurants were great I enjoyed the buffet!
Fremont Hotel & Casino,1.45,Horrible,Bad: Rude staff. Cleaniness. Bed. Had to change rooms three times. I will never stay there again!. Good: Nothing
Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.35,Good hotel at Fremont street.,"Good: Good hotel at Fremont street. But do not expect something special. Relatively old rooms, no WIFI in the rooms, but the bed was comfortable, the staff was nice, and the Hotel is direct in the heart of Old Las Vegas."

Fremont Hotel & Casino,5,Perfect location and best staff from top to bottom!,"Bad: Only thing I would have changed is the climate control.

They let me choose what floor I wanted to be on, which I've never gotten from anywhere else. Location is PRIME. Fremont Street is right outside their doors! The room is just like any other average hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. Michael Ovalles was very helpful in showing us around.

Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,2.9,Not worth the price,"Bad: The wait to enter the buffet was too long never got in the whole week.. When I went to the other restaraunt I was told I couldn't order certain items as they are for happy hour only so I left. They also did not have a pool or any alternative except travel 18 miles to their other facility and use their pool. They never even gave me a discount for lack of this facitilityor even notifying me as I made my reservation months in advance, I also did not like having to park outside of the parking garage only cause I was riding a motorcycle the parking garage was for cars only. I felt as though I was a second class citizen, no laundry facility service or machines . Good: The location was good and the staff especially the cleaning of my room was great."

One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster.

Fremont Hotel & Casino,4.6,Casino have finally decided to drop all resort fee's to make customers happy!!,Bad: One of the things we did not like was the fact that we couldn't wake up to a cup of coffee in the morning without paying an arm and a leg for one. The other was that they should at least offer free coffee and beverages to their customers. Washington State casino have a coffee and soda machines for their customers to enjoy as they play.

Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.75,Great Stay at the Fremont,"Bad: The room needs to be updated. The bathroom fixtures needs to be renovated.

Good: It was close to all the activities on Fremont Street. I enjoyed being in the center of Downtown, everything was within walking distance."
Fremont Hotel & Casino,4.8,Will come again!!!!,Bad: The bed was too soft for my mate and we need more pillows. They were happy to provide the additional pillows. Good: The entire staff was very nice. The room was clean and we stayed on the north-side and did not hear any noise from Fremont Street.

Fremont Hotel & Casino,3.55,We loved being in the center of action and its great value.,"Bad: I guess the lack of facilities in the modern world. No pool, hot tub, gym.

The Charlesmark Hotel,3.35,The location is central to a range of must-see sights,"Bad: Very expensive hotel relative to services eg Breakfast is repetitive and very weighted to carbohydrates. No skimmed milk, only half and half. Lounge area a little jaded, perhaps Remember to add in the tax etc as this significantly adds to the cost of the hotel. Good: The location is central to a range of must-see sights"
The Charlesmark Hotel,3.95,Adequate for one night stay in heart of Boston,Bad: Room is on the small side. I was on one of the back rooms. There are no views and other buildings can see inside your room since windows are high. Breakfast is not attended and no hot option. Very narrow corridors. Good: The decor of the room is very modern and pleasing with sound equipment for those that want to listen to music with speakers on the wall. Floor of shower is non-slippery. Decor of the bathroom is also very nice. Location is outstanding with Copley subway station accross the street as well as bus stop. Restuarants and shops in Newbury Street one block away. Bagels and donuts in breakfast were fresh.
The Charlesmark Hotel,3.95,"location, small comfortable room.","Bad: noisy room heater/AC unit. Good: location, small comfortable room."
The Charlesmark Hotel,5,Great find in Boston,"Good: Great location. Friendly, helpful staff. Good breakfast, nice to have a lounge to sit and read the newspapers provided. Stored luggage until we were ready to leave. Would stay again."

The Charlesmark Hotel,3.75,Boston trip for MIT graduation days,"Bad: One of the room maids kept forgetting to leave sufficient quantities of basic toiletries and the quality of bathroom cleaning could have been better. Good: Very friendly receptionist personnel, special thanks to Jesse! Nice view to the Library, added to the room booking for free. Plenty of varied places to eat out within a few mins walk from the hotel, catering for all choices."
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.15,Well located small hotel,Bad: Outlook from room. Good: Staff helpfulness Well designed use of limited space
The Charlesmark Hotel,5,I loved the room I was in.,Bad: Maybe it was just my room but the fridge was kind of hard to reach. Good: I loved the room I was in. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the room was quite cozy. The location was perfect as well. I would definitely stay here again.
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.6,Top location,"Parking is available at a parking garage a few streets away if you use the one recommended by the hotel. The rate the hotel give you is not the lowest rate you can get, I parked at the same parking lot for less using a parking app. It is worth looking into this if you are driving. Secondly, make sure you try and get a room with a queen bed. The doubles are tiny and this was my only regret with staying at this hotel. The location of the property is excellent. Easy to get to from the freeway, and easy to walk to Boston Common, restaurants, bars and local tourist attractions. Staff were very helpful on arrival and during the stay. No expense was spared in the room in terms of technology (had hard wired speakers even in the bathroom). Not sure they are needed, but was a nice touch. Rooms were clean, bathrooms small but had everything you need and was nice to have a shower not standing over a bath for once."
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.4,1. Outstanding location!,"Bad: There was NOTHING we disliked! The room was small but that was to be expected and the two of us were very comfortable there. The room size and the narrow hallways gave the entire place the European feel... nothing wrong with that, right. Good: 1. Outstanding location! Close to the T, the airport shuttle, historic churches, Public Library (also an attraction in itself), Prudential SkyDeck, the amazing Newbury St. with all the shops and restaurants... I could go on and on. 2. Excellent staff - attentive, helpful, understanding, flexible... overall very pleasant without being over the top. 3. A small place that felt like home, without that big corporate hotel feel. 4. A good continental breakfast that never ran out of any items. 5. Free WiFi that ran very well. 6. Reliable cooling/heating system. 7. All the small details such as nice toiletry items, modern plumbing, detachable shower head, hairdryer, iron, a huge mirror... Thank you, CharlesMark! We hope to stay there again."
The Charlesmark Hotel,5,"Modern style, great location, super helpful staff,...","Bad: Highly recommend. Good: Modern style, great location, super helpful staff, continental breakfast included, great value, clean"
The Charlesmark Hotel,2.3,"bad experience, doesn't worth cash at all","Bad: staff r not helpful at all, room was really soooooo tiny even I booked large room, but the staff gave me two options,, if I want the large room I booked,,,, I have to go up a stair with my luggages, then down a stair again with my luggage to the basement, then walk through a hall way to reach my large room,,, or get a tiny one so I can use the elevator and make it easier for me to reach a room with all my luggages. really Bad experience,, I paid 200 a day for this SH,, I would Pay only 160 at Bellagio LAS VEGAS and get the best service in stars hotel,,,better than this hotel charlesMark. dont book this hotel Pals in case u have other options. Good: location"
The Charlesmark Hotel,2.7,It was overpriced.,Bad: Size of room. Good: Leaving
The Charlesmark Hotel,3.35,Feels cheaper,"Bad: I don't really know why this hotel has such a high rating. It's decent, but definitely not worth 3* and 300+ I paid for the room. Nothing in particular, but just the entire feel and look of it was more in the 2*, 150-200 range. Also, there were some road works taking place just outside the hotel at 7AM that produced insufferable noise, so I wish I had known that before booking."
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.6,Really liked the modern feel to the place !,"Bad: Nothing to dislike awesome stay. Good: Really liked the modern feel to the place ! Nice looking spot, so I kinda look like a bum when I travel so not to attract crime or Theves . And I usually travel around walking and exploring so I travel light aka bum looking ... the staff was very friendly to me . The room was awesome nice touches classical music playing after a shower and some music I was rejuvenated and went to the bar an had great conversation really a good memory to my trip I'd defiantly stay here again like the small hotel appeal . Great stay ."
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.4,Fun,"Bad: Price did not fit the size of the room. It felt more like a cubicle. Good: The room was nice and clean, came with safe, and fridge."
The Charlesmark Hotel,5,Wonderful great city and the hotel was in the perfect location,Strange drainage smell when entering the reception area Loved the location and friendly staff

The Charlesmark Hotel,3.75,Good location to explore Boston,"Bad: The room/bed were a little small and the room was quite gloomy, very little natural light and the lighting wasn't great. Would have also preferred tea/coffee in the room rather that the large stereo/DVD system but that's just personal preference. Good: Great location, and friendly staff. Nice bar."
The Charlesmark Hotel,5,Excellent,I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet
The Charlesmark Hotel,5,Excellent,Good: I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet
The Charlesmark Hotel,3.95,Small rooms and beds but excellent location,"Bad: Provided breakfast is just bagels and doughnuts + tea/coffee. I'm not sure how that qualifies as continental! Beds are very small but OK for a relatively small couple - would be uncomfortable if you are much over 6 feet. Rooms are small but that's the only way you are getting a room at this price in this location. Good: Location is excellent (we walked everywhere including from Boston Back Bay station to the hotel with our bags - it's a 10min walk), staff were friendly, rooms are small but reasonably well appointed, hotel and rooms were very clean."
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.15,Pleasantly surprised,Bad: Closest parking was a 4-5 minute walk away for 28 overnight. Closer parking is available for 48 overnight. Good: Great neighborhood on Boylston and a block from Newbury St. Plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance to choose from. It is one of the better values compared to other hotels in Boston. Half a block from the Copley T station if you want to get to another part of the city. 15- 20 minute walk to Fenway Park for the Sox game.
The Charlesmark Hotel,3.5,Location and the New England style building and the room is...,Bad: Bed is too small for two people and the blanket is too thin. The staff are just ok not very friendly though. Good: Location and the New England style building and the room is cute.
The Charlesmark Hotel,2.7,Disappointing.,Bad: Room and bed were tiny - not even a queen bed. Bed took up most of the room. Breakfast was coffee and a bunch of cold bagels. Bathroom was also tiny. Not worth the exhorbitant price at all. Good: Location was good.
The Charlesmark Hotel,1.65,Not good,"Bad: Heater didn't work, so the room was very cold. Room wifi was crazy slow, so I couldn't use it AT ALL. Staffs were lazy and rude, especially when they call. Good: Location. Center boston"

The Charlesmark Hotel,3.95,The stay at charles mark hotel was comfortable. Affordable and in a great location.,Bad: I didn't like the siE of the rooms cozy but to small. Good: I liked the comfort of a small room the location and the staff that was working there
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.6,Great hotel for a quick getaway,"Bad: The fan in our room made a ticking sound throughout the night which was annoying. Also, there are not many choices for food. A couple of flat breads are offered for dinner. Breakfast is more reasonable with pastries, bagels, and fruit. Good: The bed was very comfortable. The space in the room was well used. Very clean. I loved the exposed brick throughout the halls, and that actual keys are given out, not key cards. Great location and staff."
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.6,"Nice staff, good continental breakfast included.","Bad: Too pricy, very basic for what you pay for. Good: Nice staff, good continental breakfast included. Excellent location."
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.6,Short stay in an excellent location.,Bad: Room too small. Late check in at 15:00. Good: Excellent location and the staff was super polite. WiFi was working good.

The Charlesmark Hotel,3.75,Boston trip for MIT graduation days,"One of the room maids kept forgetting to leave sufficient quantities of basic toiletries and the quality of bathroom cleaning could have been better.

Plenty of varied places to eat out within a few mins walk from the hotel, catering for all choices."
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.15,The breakfast is nothing special.,Bad: The breakfast is nothing special. Parking is 30 per each 24Hrs.
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.6,Good value for location.,Bad: Breakfast - hardly adequate. Good: Location and value for that location. Easy to get to - right across from bus station to/from Logan airport. Room was small but comfortable and updated.
The Charlesmark Hotel,2.9,Convienantly located with lots of places to walk to,"Bad: The rooms are tiny, but expensive. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They seemed bored and not so welcoming to visitors. They didnt refill the coffee thermos for breakfast and didnt care to either. It was awkward. Good: The place is clean and centrally located. I enjoyed the music playing in the room upon arrival. Its been updated although its an old building."
The Charlesmark Hotel,5,Perfect place for a Nostalgic Return to Beloved Boston,Good: The wifi connection in my room was loose and disconnected during the Inauguration weekend. But the nightclerk (red-haired Irish lass) tried very hard to fix it for me. In the morning William 3 came in and tried to fix it.

The Charlesmark Hotel,3.55,Good place to stay for a week-end in Boston,Bad: Breakfast is very poor. Good: Room was very comfortable. Ideally positionned.
The Charlesmark Hotel,5,We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we...,"Good: We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived till we left. We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future"
The Charlesmark Hotel,2.9,"Unimpressive, not worth the money","Bad: Room was very small and not comftorable for two people. It felt like a third the size of a standard hotel room with just enough space to walk around the bed and a chair in the corner. Bathroom is super small. View from our main floor window was a sketchy back alley with construction. Included breakfast is bagels, donuts and fruit, don't expect a warm meal.Our first night we asked the person at the front desk if there was any pubs or places close by to have a drink. He said he didn't think so... Well the next night we were out exploring the city and found half a dozen bars, restaurants and pubs a block away on the same street and discovered we were a block away from the famous Newbury street! All in all I feel like this hotel is over priced, unimpressive and uncomfortable. Good: The location of the Charlesmark is great for tourists and people wanting to be in a good spot to transit around but feel safe and enjoy some night life"
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.8,"Great location, staff and room!","Bad: Super slow wifi, Comcast kept getting stuck and I would have to wait about 45 seconds just for the channel to change - wish there's was at least oatmeal for breakfast. Good: Location - room - clean - right in front of public library of Boston"
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.15,Value for money,"Bad: The room was very small and dark. Bathroom was large. The window faced an alleyway. Good: Amazing location and great price, clean room and nice staff."

The shower has great water pressure and the shower head is adjustable.
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.6,Yes it's small put clearly stated and really set up well.,"Bad: The parking garage was farther than we thought, was inconvenient but realize its a city and parking is always difficult. I would of liked valet service and would of paid more happily for it. Good: Yes it's small put clearly stated and really set up well. Was very fresh and updated not to mention clean. Would defiantly stay here again on our next visit. The staff in the evening was very efficient and helpful."

The Charlesmark Hotel,5,Great! We plan to come back in February.,"Bad: The TV was on in the lounge during breakfast, tuned to GMA and Kelly Ripa-terrible shows, too loud, couldn't find a remote. It would be better on close caption with no sound or another channel, or have the remote so that breakfasters can change it. Thanks!. Good: Atmosphere. Location."

The Charlesmark Hotel,4.4,Cozy room and vibe to this place.,Cozy room and vibe to this place... many food options close by.. minutes from Fenway Park and the house of blues
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.6,"Great place to stay for the money, but don't count on the complimentary breakfast.","Bad: Complimentary breakfast. Good: Location was great, right where we wanted to see some attractions. Free breakfast was a little misleading, (just say appetizers, and fruit basket). But overall, would definitely recommend, and stay again. Staff was good, and room was quiet."
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.4,"Great location, excellent staff. Small room, but sufficient for a single person.",Good: Coffee and juice were nice to start out the day with! Cold cereal would have been a plus.
The Charlesmark Hotel,1.45,Excellent location in city centre,Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient location in the city centre walkable to most attractions
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.15,Great location and a nice play to stay in Boston,"Bad: Breakfast can be better. Its very simple, I had to go out and seek for a real breakfast because the hotel option was not attractive at all. Good: Very good location. Our room was good, you get what you pay, anything more."

The Charlesmark Hotel,4.6,"Wonderful Hotel, Awesome Location","Bad: Breakfast was a little sparse but was as advertised. Good: Nice room, small but cozy."
The Charlesmark Hotel,3.55,Good spread of breakfast.,"Bad: The room we stayed in has a window was facing an alley. We were woken up at 3 am by the garbage truck and they were there until 5.30 AM picking trash from the entire alley, not a good idea for light sleepers. The hotel should invest a bit in better soundproof windows. Good: Good spread of breakfast. Friendly staff Great shower and toiletries"
The Charlesmark Hotel,5,Very nice hotel in Boston center,Nothing to complain about Everything was fine and week with the price. It is very central in Boston and close to the public transportation.
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.6,Excellent location,Good: Excellent location
The Charlesmark Hotel,5,Boston Marathon runner's ideal location!,"Bad: Breakfast a bit simple, but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also, the safe in our room didn't seem to work, but it wasn't a big deal. Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April), the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line, which could be very useful or very inconvenient, depending on whether you're a runner or not!"

But what was there was absolutely fantastic. Good: We were super-well accommodated, the staff was super-friendly and helpful. Location is great, and even on a loud street you couldn't here a thing."
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.15,Location and staff.,Bad: Tempeture control. Fan was not automatic. Had to manually turn off and on. not a deal breaker. Good: Location and staff. Staff was very friendly and helpfull. We arrived a few hours before check in and they held our luggage while we explored the area. Lots of shopping an dinner choices close by. T was 2 minutes away. Room was nice.
The Charlesmark Hotel,5,a Boston great!,"Good: continental breakfast was great - and length of time offered was excellent. 24 hour desk personnel was a special plus and very helpful - at any hour. location is excellent - nothing better for shopping, restaurants, public transportation, sightseeing, etc. Close to everything you visit Boston for and great staff plus affordable."

Good: Great location, right near two T stops and directly across from the Boston Public Library. Super nice staff. Great bar downstairs. Great price. We loved having music speakers overhead in main room and bathroom. Roomy, hot shower with great water pressure. Free continental breakfast with good coffee."
The Charlesmark Hotel,4.6,Was a great stay!,"Bad: I think there could be more options offered as breakfast (there were only bagels and donut like something, and fruits), but it was still enough. So it's not something I didn't like but something that can be improved. Good: This hotel was a great one! When we entered room, there was classical music coming from the stereos, which give us a very nice feeling to start with. The bathroom, the towels, the bed, everything was clean, organized. I wish I could stick around more and enjoy the room as I stayed for 2 nights and was in the hotel to sleep only. The room was also facing the Boston public library, which was a blissful view, that makes you feel like you're in full luxury. The surrounding area was great, the parallel street (I believe it was Newburry) is full of nice clothing boutiques. It's really close to variety of food options and also right next to Copley station which makes public transportation a total ease. But I think when the weather permits, it's totally walkable to go around Freedom Trail etc. Also, I arrived very early in the morning and left in the middle of night, both felt okay to be out in the street, which is something I value the most."
AC Hotel by Marriott Boston Downtown,5,Excellent stay. Hope to stay there again.,Bad: Dont change a thing. Good: Staff was very accommodating even those we shared elevator rides with. Location was central and easy to walk places. We enjoyed our stay.
The Hotel of South Beach,4.4,Great hotel like the rooftop pool,Bad: Pool close too early. Should be stay availble all the time overnight. Good: Room cleanness and staff
The Hotel of South Beach,5,A comfortable hotel in a great location,"Bad: Couldn't find fault with anything. Good: It might sound strange to say that I was ill in bed for most of my stay but still gave the hotel top ratings!. However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service. Wish I had been well enough to take advantage of this great little hotel."
The Hotel of South Beach,5,"First time in Miami and had a great stay at The Hotel, South Beach. Loved it!","Good: The room was lovely and spacious, bed very comfy. Staff changed our bed every day and fresh towels. We could not have been better looked after by manager Lewis. Events organizers Ricardo and John were great help for tours."
The Hotel of South Beach,5,Unreal,"Bad: Expensive of course, wish the hotel restaurant was more reasonably priced because we wanted to go but couldnt justify. Good: Bed was great and the staff was so genuinely kind"
The Hotel of South Beach,3.55,"Next to Ocean Drive, so the beach is over the street.","Bad: Very noisy at night (24h party directly below the rooms in the other building, traffic). We didn't stay in the main building, we weren't informed before. So please check before, otherwise there's not much sleep possible. Good: Next to Ocean Drive, so the beach is over the street. Room was huge and clean. Valet parking was very fast (39/d), staff was friendly. Also the roomservice was fast and delicious."
The Hotel of South Beach,3.15,For 169 plus 39 valet fee -should be better!!!!,Bad: 1. Elevator was broken room was on 3rd floor--moved after a time to another wing with working elevator. 2. Pool under repair--sent to another hotel--no available chairs at the pool - so no pool on a 95 day. Wasted 3 hours of the day. 3. Told there was a 30 minute wait to get a car from valet--called at 7:20 AM--valet was not told to get the car until 7:53 AM. Almost missed plane. Good: management staff was very good when they were there
The Hotel of South Beach,4.6,Lively stay at a wonderful hotel,Bad: Can be a little noisy at night but that is the compromise for being at the centre of all the action. Good: If you are looking to be at the centre of all the South Beach madness then this is the perfect hotel. Located right across from the beautiful beach and in the middle of the Art Deco district. Large comfortable rooms that offer full amenities. Good rooftop pool with great snack and drinks bar. Staff very helpful and John the concierge was great.
The Pearl Hotel,5,Perfect location,"This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again."
Hotel Renew,5,Close To The Beach.. and now My Heart - Ocean Tower Resort,"We have just returned from 10 days at the Aqua Ocean Tower Resort in Waikiki Beach, HI. While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu."
Hotel Renew,3,Lenore is truly great and an asset to this hotel,"When you read the information about Lenore, believe it. She is the bright and shining asset to this hotel. The staff are very personable and helpful. The rooms definitely need some upgrading. The location however is wonderful."
Hotel Renew,5,Well kept secret in Waikiki,"This well kept secret has excellent and friendly service with reasonably priced rooms. The absence of a restaurant and bar in the hotel is barely noticed as numerous restaurants and bars are only steps from your room. I would put this hotel up against any on the beach with service and cleanliness. The hotel is updating all the rooms, which are slightly dated, to reflect an Asian influence. This includes projection TV and steam shower. I can't wait!"
Hotel Renew,4,"Great Value for the Money, Location, Location, Location","The staff was very helpful and friendly! Lenore was awesome! She delivered a bottle of champagne for our anniversary! Our ocean view room was wonderful and we are looking forward to staying again once the renovation is completed!The rooms were clean, but need some upgrading--But we were only in the room to sleep so it really didn't bother us...The mini fridge came in handy as well as the ABC Market a few steps away. Subway, Coldstone, Wolfgang Puck's are two minutes away walking...Sushi place within 5 minutes walking!!! McDonald's Burger King within 3 minutes walking...Check out the Pacific Hotel for some awesome cuisine and a huge aquarium!Thanks for making our 4th of July fun....Hey, everyone, don't forget to pick up the Entertainment Book for Hawaii...We saved a lot on Parasailing, Hiking, Snorkeling, Restaurants, Pearl Harbor, etc...Great two for one offers! I got mine on Ebay!"
Hotel Renew,4,great value for money,"The hotel is very near the sea...I think about 30 seconds on foot!The rooms are comfortable and clean. No luxury but very good value for money, if we consider the wonderful location of this hotel. Moreover, the staff is extremely kind, friendly and willing to help you...I will never forget the housekeeping manager, who was so sweet, and always gave me breakfast (and in abundant helping) after 10.00 am, since I was always late (let's say I enjoyed Honolulu's nightlife...). All in all, the aloha spirit is so evident in this hotel, which I strongly recommend."
Hotel Renew,5,Wonderful Surprise,"Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed."
Hotel Renew,4,Great location and nice price,The hotel staff was great as was the location. The only thing I'd say needs improvement is the actual building and rooms. The rooms seemed a bit old and could use major renovations. But for the price we paid with a last minute booking we were happy with the accomodations.
Hotel Renew,4,"Friendly staff, great location","I stayed at the Ocean Tower Hotel for a week in early May based on positive reviews from TripAdvisor. These reviews were completely fair. This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)"
Hotel Renew,5,Great stay experience!,"The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. My fiance and I have made 3 trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Leonor in particular (and as mentioned by numerous reviews here) made us feel more 'at home' than at home.Also, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms. The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs."
Hotel Renew,5,The Best stay I've had in Waikiki,"Everything positive you've read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on. I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu."
Hotel Renew,5,Great Value,"We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!"
Hotel Renew,4,Hawaii,"I really like the trip to Hawaii, and I think that everybody in the hotel was really nice to us in every think, the rooms were really clean, the breakfast were good too, and all the people help me when I had a question. I would come to the same hotel if I'll return to Hawaii. It was a really good experience.Ana"
Hotel Renew,4,Comfortable hotel near the beach,"Had a really nice stay at hotel renew. Was close to the beach near to where they have a concrete break to stop the waves crashing, so would be good for young families. The bed was really comfy. Only a couple of negatives, the room we were in had a window in the bathroom, and a frosted glass door to the bathroom. This meant light streamed in through the window and door in the morning. Also there wasn't much for breakfast if you are trying to avoid sugar and there wasn't a lot of space.Aloha!!!Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for choosing to stay with us and for providing valuable feedback of your experience. Were glad you enjoyed our close proximity to our famous Kuhio Beach, restaurants, shopping outlets, and tourist attractions We are dedicated to touch all we encounter with integrity and the gracious spirit of Aloha as we fulfill the dreams of our guest. Overall we hope you had a positive experience on Oahu, and enjoy all the adventure our island has to offer. If your travels bring you back to Waikiki, we would be delighted to host you again. Mahalo,Thomas Harris Jr. General Manager"
Hotel Renew,5,A Perfect Hotel for a Perfect Getaway!!!!!!,"My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki - my first time there, and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!"
Hotel Renew,5,Excellent customer service!,"We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our 10th anniversary trip to Oahu. After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!"
Hotel Renew,5,Loved it....Location and Friendly Staff!!!,"We stayed here because it was 1 on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all! It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT"
Hotel Renew,5,Good Time in Waikiki,"My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel."
Hotel Renew,5,"Great Location, Excellent Hospitality!","Stayed here for a week and had a fantastic experience. After reading other great reviews, decided that combined with price, this sounded like a great place to stay. Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!"
Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown,5,Great New York Hotel,"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit. After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons. It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park. However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations. They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room. The breakfast provided through room-service was delicious (you must try the truffle scramble eggs). My dinner at the Cut was outstanding. This is an exceptional addition to the Financial Area."

MOXY New Orleans Downtown/French Quarter Area,5,Southern Hospitality at its core,"I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly."
Bienville House,5,Fabulous First,"It was our first visit to NOLA and first stay at Bienville House but it will not be our last!

Convenient beach service as related to provided towel, chair, and umbrella service. Very good happy hour prices as related to that areas prices."
Room Mate Lord Balfour,4.4,The valet parking was the worst at one time waited 45 min...,Bad: The valet parking was the worst at one time waited 45 min then 30 min for my vehicle to arrive. Twice the excuse given was the ticket inside vehicle was wrong.

There was an issue with our room and we had to spend one night in their sister hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful to make sure we were comfortable. The hotel offers a portable wifi hotspot for guests to take out with them - very cool!
Room Mate Lord Balfour,4.6,"Really modern hotel, very very clean room almost like if we...","Bad: Its not something i didn't like, its more like a recommendation since its not something quite important, and actually i don't know if other rooms have it but particularly my room didn't have a big mirror other than the one in the bathroom. Also, i think breakfast can be maybe until 11:30am, like other restaurants or hotel provide, more like a brunch style and serve more options. Good: Really modern hotel, very very clean room almost like if we were the first to use it, excellent staff. We arrived at 10am approximately since our flight was early in the morning and they managed to give us an available room. hotel is at an excellent location since its ocean drive but not at the crowded noisy part so we could party, and still be able to rest and sleep well!"

Room Mate Lord Balfour,3.75,Pleasant hotel with friendly staff,"Bad: As others have commented the Valet Parking at 35 per day is steep however it is known before you sign up to it, there is a parking lot close by that only charges 15 per day although not sure what they would charge if you wanted to leave overnight. Good: Very good location on Ocean Drive but away from the noise of the main area. Breakfast was ideal, plenty of choice and had the added bonus available until noon Rooms were clean and tidy and we did not find them small and we had two large suitcases in each as well as other hand luggage. Staff always acknowledged you"
Room Mate Lord Balfour,4.4,Nice staff in clean hotel in good location.,"Bad: The house is built in another age - access to rooms and room size are not large - but OK. The rooms are not well insulated reg. noise. The other guests behaved very nicely - good clientele - but when the garbage truck etc. is working out back, you will know it! Bring your earplugs and you'll be fine. Good: Staff was very helpful, courteous and professionel in a good way. Front desk staff responded quickly to my requests (WiFi code renewal, instruction in how to make calls from phone in room, air-con etc).

Room Mate Lord Balfour,3.95,"lovely decor, super friendly and helpful bilingual staff.","Bad: quite a bit of noise from the upstairs 'neighbors.' They could do better with soundproofing... also, the breakfast was a bit weak.

Room Mate Lord Balfour,2.1,Bed Bugs,"Bad: Bed bugs. Room too small. Too expensive When I was going to sleep, I found some bed bugs in my bed. It's terrible! I went to lobby to find someone help me. The receptionist helped me change a room. This room is even smaller than the previous one. I can't sleep all the night because it's too noisy, and I am still afraid of the bugs. The next day, I told the receptionist I would like to check out, even I booked for 3 night. She agreed, but didn't give me any compensation. I paid 300+ for a room which had bugs and was noisy, small. Good: The attitude of staff."

The staff was amazing and friendly, very courteous, always made sure you were ok and comfortable. They gave suggestions on things to do and places to go...simply amazing! The hotel smelled amazing, it's the first thing you notice walking in! It's very clean and nice. You get beach towels, a chair and umbrella. The beach is literally a block away, and you're also located a block from all of the action of South Beach. The hotel is located in a quieter area, so it's great to wind down after a long day.

The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,4.4,Best spot to be AWAY from Vegas while IN Vegas...,"Bad: I didn't like that check-in 'begins' at 4pm. You check in and wait for them to call you when your room is ready. Ours was ready at 6p. This was more of a plain hotel, not like a 'Vegas' hotel. Food, entertainment, and 'gambling' were limited. This is the best spot to be AWAY from Vegas while IN Vegas...if that's what you're looking for. Good: All amenities were top of the line."
The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,4.6,"Great hotel, will return on our next trip to Vegas","Bad: Nothing!. Good: 1.Great location, although 1 block back from the strip it is very central and perhaps better than staying on the strip to the far left or right. 2. Value for money for the size and comfort of the room 3. Short walk from hotel room to lobby entry unlike most mega hotels in Vegas 4. Small bar/casino across the road with 1 beer... unheard of on the strip"

The third time I went to follow up myself. They overcharged me 130 dollars for the room. The hotel was under renovation so it was not good being on a partial construction site with the sound of drills going off. I would advise to shop around on the strip. Good: Bed was comfortable

The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,4.8,"After the hustle and bustle of the strip, it was nice to walk into The Westin.","Bad: The elevator was tricky to use as you had to insert your room key which didn't always work. The front desk never mentioned it either so I had to figure it out on my own. Good: The location was great. The room was basic but still nice and clean. The pool was low key, perfect for relaxing."

The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,5,A nice hotel and I will stay again if I return to Vegas,"Bad: At breakfast the waiter gave you a receipt stating that although the breakfast was free (included in the price of B B) it was worth 49.98, ie they were after a tip.

Good: The hotel was less than 1/2 mile to the strip (an easy 10 minute walk), which allowed me to be close enough to take advantage of it, but far enough removed to get away from the mega-ness of it. Check-in was easy, the staff was friendly and helpful, the size of the room was pretty standard (which is all I wanted or needed), the bathroom was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was comfortable."
The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,4.15,"Nice clean and comfortable room near the strip, if the staff is willing to let you check in.",Bad: Check-in process as staff was deceptive and misleading as to when we could check-in.

A bit pricey... Good: Location, quality of free toiletries"
The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,3.15,"Started off well, but refusing to give you another room when your bathroom is flooded - disappointed","Bad: Our toilet overflowed at 1am and the water wouldn't stop. When we tried to call reception the phone didn't work. My husband went down to reception whilst I packed our clothes as I naturally assumed we would be given another room. He returned with a maintenance employee and a housekeeping employee. They refused to give us another room (so we could go back to sleep!) instead keeping us awake until 2am whilst they sorted out the problem, extracted the water from the floor (the bathroom was flooded), mopped the floor and brought fresh towels. Good: The reception staff were very friendly. A bottle of sparkling was sent to our room to celebrate our wedding anniversary upon our arrival. That was a really nice touch."

Very very inconvenient! Apparently from what the staff said they have key problems all the time n i saw lots of guest going through the same problems. Staff is also rude in a professional way.

Good: The bed was very comfortable, what I'd expect from a Westin."
The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,5,Pleasant!,"Bad: Although this hotel was a pet friendly hotel, guests are not allowed to leave their pets in the room unattended.

The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,2.7,"Choose another one, there are plenty in Las Vegas!","Bad: I will write in English so the staff can read if they wish: we arrived exactly at 4 PM (declared check in time), the room was not ready, the reason being 20 people having done an early check in, please notice that check out time is 11 AM (so they clearly have a workforce planning problem)! An extremely unfriendly staff representative told us that we had to wait, asked me to give her my phone number so that I can receive a text message when the room would be ready, meanwhile we were granted a pass for the pool (which was no extra given that the pool was available for all hotel guests as we were). I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message. At that time your room will be available!. So we went to the pool (definitely small and overcrowded), no seats available, very noisy. We waited, and waited and waited and waited... 2 hours and 20 minutes, then I went back to the lobby extremely upset, I started complaining and magically the room was ready... By the way: the text message never arrived. Good: Free parking (is this something to be appreciated)"

The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,3.35,Mediocre experience that did not meet expectations,"Bad: The hotel is very outdated. Old rooms (we were moved because of an old airco that made a lot of noise), old elevators, tiny beds that should not be sold as double unless you like sleeping on top of each other, mediocre breakfast with very little healthy options (mind you, a 7 extra charge for a cappuccino is outrageous).

The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,5,Good value near the strip.,Bad: Not a fan of cigarette smoke. But I guess you can't do anything about it in the gambling area.

Good: The proximity was great because it was easy to access and close enough to the strip. They have a great sandwich shop at the shell station on the corner open until 2 am which is a bonus and saved us a ton of on food.

The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,2.7,Extremely Disappointing.,"Bad: The fact that the Casino was being renovated and not in use, and that we weren't notified about this prior to arrival.

The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,4.4,"Pleasant stay, normal facilities would have been nice but overall an excellent option for Vegas","Bad: There is no longer a casino, and the pool is seasonal despite it easily being warm enough to be used.

The Broome,5,Chic design transports you to tranqulity,"The Broome doesnt feel like NYC at allIt captures the elegance of Morocco and you feel a world away from the traffic and bustle of the city. The rooms are small, which is standard in NYC, but I did expect a bit more space for the price. The beds are comfy with super luxury sheets. This might be an odd point, but many of the luxury hotels I have been in lately have moved away from using a fitted sheet on the bed, which leaves the guest with a flat sheet on the bottom that twists and bunches by the morning.

W Boston,2.3,Wouldn't stay their again.,Bad: When we arrived we were met by a unfriendly doorman and it was so loud due to the bar that we could barely hear the person at reception. Each day the room was made up apparently but barely even folded the sheets. towels weren't folded etc. We have stayed in lots of hotels over the years and had recently stayed at the Loews Boston which was a far far better experience with far friendlier staff. Good: Food was awesome.
W Boston,5,Wonderful stay,"Bad: The parking rates are outrageous (59 USD/day for valet), but this is for all of Boston, not just this hotel. .

W Boston,3.75,Hotel W,Noise Excellent location
W Boston,3.75,"Great staff and location, bit pricey given room decor","Bad: There was an anti-noise device plugged into each of two sockets to compensate for the fact they are in a noisy road. In fact, this emits itself a loud roaring sound. When unplugged, things were fine. The road noise was not bad at all (we were on the 12th floor). One of the senior staff kindly refunded a breakfast bill given this and another issue (cordless phone by the bed wouldn't stop beeping through the night). The restaurant and room service were extremely expensive. There was a slight sense too that some of the decor (wood-appearance veneer on cabinets, shower curtain not panel ) was a bit cheap and scuffed given the price. Good: Staff were great - thoughtful, friendly and clearly dedicated to running it well.Decor and atmosphere of front lounge area welcoming and stylish. Location is very good."

W Boston,4.8,The hotel is in a great location and is clean/modern...,"Bad: The only negative was some mysterious in-room snack bar charges that appeared on my bill after I left. I contacted the hotel, and they promptly removed them. This has happened to me at other Starwood properties before, and I'm not sure why. Good: The hotel is in a great location and is clean/modern with a courteous staff. The room I was in was spacious and quiet, and had everything I needed."
W Boston,5,Central and fun place to stay in Boston.,Bad: The only draw back is the noise at night from th people coming in and out of the lounge and adjacent nightclub. Though it didn't bother us personally. Good: I loved how central the location was. The hotel is in the theatre district. We walked to the harbour as well as Shopping and all the parks around us. After a long day of walking around we enjoyed A massage at the Bliss spa. We also enjoyed having a drink at the lounge before going to bed. It was a great experience for us. It might be too noisy for people who want peace and quite. I also had the best sleep in those beds. I would recommend staying at the W Boston.

W Boston,4.6,The welcome was great.,"Bad: The doormen could have reacted a bit quicker to open the inner doors, which were very heavy.

W Boston,1.9,This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in my career.,"Bad: This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in my career. Out of hotel stays in 29 countries, hotel W made the top of the list in poor customer relations, poor cleanliness, and horrible problem resolution. First they gave me an occupied room, then they down graded me to a lower grade room over night. The next day they didn't even clean our room when we returned, and they gave away the original room they were hold for me. The suites bathroom smelled like urine so bad and when we complained, it still was not cleaned by that evening. I had to fight with the hotel to apply a discount rate they never even offered. They have a slogan what ever when ever I can't say they once lived by that motto. This is not my first time at the W hotel organization but it certainly will be my last! Deplorable customer experience and engagement."

"Mandarin Oriental, Miami",5,Dazzled,"My wife will thank me forever. Wonderful hotel in Miami, not on the main beach strip but I would say in a better position, if what you want to do is relax and enjoy the area. The rooms were superb and we had one with a huge balcony overlooking the harbour and pool. Breakfast was just and simply amazing especially when sitting outside in the morning. Pool area well maintained and serviced by staff. There are very few amenities outside of the hotel, one has to walk for about 10 minutes to get to shops etc. Concierge services was very helpful, a big shout out to Carlos who was the most helpful concierge guy we had come across for a while, he is a mine of information about the local area. This hotel oozes luxury and very family friendly, my family of 4 was really looked after, Two small gripes, the hotel should have somewhere in the evening where a family can enjoy drinks and desserts, that is not the bar, very often we could not get a space there in the evening or felt uncomfortable to be there with kids, the other point being in room dining could be improved, the menu was a bit short for us and the kitchen was not flexible enough to tailor some dishes, for example making the pasta spicy, we ordered some rice with our chicken and it was just undercooked , it was changed immediately and we were given complimentary glasses of wine but it was too late when one is starving !"
"The Ritz-Carlton, Boston",5,Great family friendly stay,"We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in a club levelSuite. Location was wonderful, right by Boston Common and multiple T stops. Service was wonderful, especially from the concierge, front desk and club lounge staff. Staff made my 4 young children feel special and they enjoyed the scavenger hunt and little toys provided. The room was lovely and well appointed though a little smaller than it appeared in the website. I would definitely stay here again when I Boston! In fact Im planning on a business trip to Cambridge soon and considering staying here and commuting.Dear mnmorange,So glad to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with your family at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston, with all of the city so easily accessible just outside our doors. It is wonderful to know that you and your children were well taken care of by the friendly and professional ladies and gentlemen throughout the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your visit. We hope you will return for that upcoming business trip - getting to Cambridge from the hotel is a breeze - as well as many more occasions, when it will be our sincere pleasure to welcome you back.Warmest regards,William P.

The St. Regis New York,5,Best Hotel in New York,"Service was outstanding from the valet, bellman, front desk to the butler. Everyone is top notch.

The St. Regis New York,3,Underwhelming,"Checking in was the worst part of my experience. As I was standing in line to check in, there was one person in front of me who was being assisted and two other guests in line behind me also waiting to check in with only one front desk employee. I was in line for 7 minutes and never did the lady at the front desk make eye contact with me or signal her customer to hold on while she got some other employees to assist her. It was rude, unprofessional and totally unacceptable from any hotel of thus caliber. 2 minutes is the maximum amount of time you should wait before being acknowledged. Clearly the staff needs better training. That frustration aside, at approximately 6pm I ran into a friend from back home who was waiting for her room. She arrived at 4 and had been relegated to wait at the bar because there were no rooms available to honor her reservation. She had theater tickets and needed her room, so at her behest I inquired to the manager about its status. The manager was apologetic but couldn't guarantee when the room would become available. In the end it all worked out, but the my being neglected at check-in and her room not being ready are two things that you should never experience at a hotel like the St. Regis. Yes the rooms are nice, yes the hotel is well maintained, but the service is for me the most important, and the service that I experienced was slightly below average.

The St. Regis New York,5,A first class experience.,"Le St.-Rgis est incroyable. What a gorgeous hotel and what an upscale experience you will live by staying there. It was a dream come true. And if it wasn't enough, I bumped into Kate Mara in the elevator. I tried to act cool but totally failed. The rooms are perfect. The staff is perfect.

The St. Regis New York,5,City Break,"Stayed here for two nights and had a great time. This hotel has the best redemption for SPG points value, and we took advantage to pamper ourselves. It was really very nice, though one mishap occurred when we were billed for something in the bar that we didn't order. The reception cleared it for us right away without the hassle we may of experienced at some other hotel. We didn't receive the 5th Ave view we were hoping for, but that's only fair when using points. Would definitely stay again.Dear Rose2li, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
The St. Regis New York,5,Great every time,"I've been taking my wife here for her birthday for the past 5 years. We stay either 5 or 6 days. Great location, great service. The desk staff are always helpful. Usually we get to take the Bentley for a ride to the Frick or another museum. That's a special treat for me. Last year they put us in a temporary room so we could take a nap until our reserved room was ready, then they upgraded us to a suite which was OMG. I couldn't believe how nice they were. We start every morning with the butler service coffee and something my wife packs for us. We are already looking forward to our stay in December 2016 and we just got tickets to The Comet to complement our stay. Oh, I forgot to mention it's an easy walk to Broadway and 5th Avenue shopping. I tried booking for December 2017 but it's still too early but I will book as soon as they let me.Dear ms2020, We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.We aim to offer our guests a chic home away from home while they sojourn in the city and are delighted to have had you at the property!Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel on TripAdvisor, and we will see you in December!Please contact me directly at octavia.margineanstregis.com and I might be able to arrange your 2017 trip as well.

The St. Regis New York,5,The staff makes it,"Between the front desk (too many greats to name) to Hussain and Israel (tenth floor butlers), to the great staff at King Cole's, this is an excellent property. I have stayed in the Four Seasons, Ritz, and elsewhere, and found this to be a great place. Highly appreciated. Room was great, but as is clear from the hotel business, property is secondary to service.Service rules, and the St Regis staff is excellent. Kudos to Krista the concierge (not to miss the stars). I recommend this hotel. Expensive, yes, but value received.Dear rowingman,Thank you so much for sharing your kind words about our staff. Our team makes it our mission to provide genuine service to each and every guest and we are so pleased that you experienced this firsthand.

The St. Regis New York,5,Can there be a 10!,"I love the St Regis (generally speaking but especially the New York). I've stayed here 12 times over the last 4 years or so. It just seems to get better each time. Tire's a great new feature which is the Rooms control Manager (Molly) emailing me ahead of time to see when we would be arriving. My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay. Finally Kevin and Juan our In Room dining attendants - just as perfect as can be. I named names because this is what this place is about. Consistent and friendly staff that makes The St Regis our home away form home. We really love it.Dear Kenneth,Thank you so much for taking the time to not only share your feedback regarding your most recent visit, but also to be so detailed and generous with your comments about our team members. Molly, Shelomie, Hugo, Krista, McKinley, Marianna, Kevin, and Juan are indeed amongst our most stellar performers and we could not be happier to learn that they made your and Ryne's visit enjoyable and memorable. Rest assured that they will receive the well-deserved recognition.Please come back soon! We want to be your home away from home many more times to come!Happy New Year!!!Daniela on behalf of All Your SRNY Friends"
The St. Regis New York,1,The most humiliating hotel experience,"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
The St. Regis New York,4,"Classic building, mostly spectacular service, skip the food","We spent 5 nights here in a regular room in December. The good: We loved the building's character, and old NYC charm. The location can't be beat. The butlers were overall very helpful, especially Emina. The car service is lovely, and the driver we had (Robert) was very nice. The concierges were interacted with (I have forgotten names) were both superb. Housekeeping was OUTSTANDING after the first night. Very much appreciated. The bell staff and doormen were also mostly really great. We felt very welcomed most of the time we interacted with staff.The not as good: A few minor misses upon entering room for the first time - there was some debris from prior guests. One of the butlers didn't provide the same great service as the others. Nothing to be totally fussed about, but these misses stand out all the more against the otherwise stellar service. Really the only true disappointment was that we weren't impressed by our Room Service breakfast at all - best to skip.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and do recommend if it fits your NYC plans.Dear Nakoa G,Thank you very much for reviewing your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to write you review and provide us with your feedback. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your room and the Butler service, but are disappointed that you were not impressed with your Room Service breakfast. We will share your thoughts with our Food Beverage team and will be sure to address this internally. We hope to have an opportunity to welcome you back on your next trip to New York City.Kindest Regards,Senih GerayGeneral Manager"
The St. Regis New York,5,Wonderful Hotel,"Of course it is very beautiful, and from its look you might think that it would be stuffy, but it is not- Very friendly and welcoming staff, and the Head Butler, Nestor, on the 7th floor could not have been a better representative in making us feel at home! Best Hotel in NYC- have stayed in many , luxury and not,in NYC and all over the world. Actually always wanted to stay at the St. Regis, and this did not disappoint!Dear Diane,We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and that Nestor made you feel at home. Our Signature Butler service differentiates us from the competition, and we are thrilled that you were able to experience this first hand.We look forward to welcoming you back to New York again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih Geray"
The St. Regis New York,4,An afternoon treat in the King Cole bar,"We took a break from shopping and treated ourselves to a cocktail in the famous King Cole bar at the St Regis. Great experience, it was fairly quiet and we were able to enjoy our drinks and have a chat with Mathias - who made our visit a fun experience.Can certainly recommend and will try to return before we head back to England!Dear grarus, Thank you for visiting our King Cole Bar, the home of The Bloody Mary and Maxfield Parrish Art Nouveau masterpiece the mural behind the King Cole Bar. We are thrilled you enjoyed your drinks. We hope you have a chance to visit again before your trip back to Europe. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
The St. Regis New York,5,Perfect Hotel in a Perfect Location,"We hadn't stayed at the St. Regis for many years. We decided to try it again for a 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. We were upgraded to a larger suite than we had reserved. It was a beautifully appointed room with all the modern amenities. It was a smart room that had all the controls for the lighting and draperies from either room.We had a beautiful view of 5th avenue from our living room. The room came with butler service which was a great amenity.The best part of the St. Regis besides the wonderful rooms is definitely the location. You step out of the hotel and you're in the middle of a shopper's paradise. Every designer store is at your doorstep. So if you want to shop till you drop it's a great location. You're also steps away from Central Park and all the wonderful museums we have in New York City.The St. Regis has it all, great service, beautiful rooms and a perfect location. Looking to return soon to enjoy being in the city!Dear MissS85, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your special occasion. Happy Anniversary and many more happy years to come!On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
The St. Regis New York,5,Fancy,"Stopped in for mimosas and coffee while shopping in 5th Avenue. Where else can you get a Veuve Cliquot Mimosa Beautiful, nostalgic, old world. They also have a Nat King Cole Bar with wonderful history.Dear Cheriejay, Thank you very much for your kind words. We are pleased that you enjoyed your mimosa at our iconic King Cole Bar, and we hope to welcome you back again soon. Kindly, Senih Geray General Manager"
The St. Regis New York,3,"Classic, but uninspiring. Over rated.","I stayed in a huge two-room suite here, and I just don't understand the appeal. Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team"
The St. Regis New York,5,"Great Hotel, Great Staff, Excellent Stay","My wife and I stayed at the St Regis for 8 nights in June 2018 as part pleasure part business trip. This was our second time at the hotel and we cannot fault it. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very memorable. The hotel's location made it great to get around the City and the friendliness of the staff made our time there very enjoyable. Janelle in the fitness centre was a particular favourite of ours as she made going to the gym in the mornings a very welcoming and friendly experience. We will definitely stay here upon our return to New York CityDear GK1708,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We are very pleased to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and especially your experience in the Athletic Club.

The St. Regis New York,5,The Best Hotel I've Ever Stayed In NYC!,"In the words of Shirley Bassey: Where do I begin Jajaja. Well the rooms are sumptuous and big! Especially by NYC standards and compared to hotels of the same category. The service is amazing you feel pampered all throughout your stay. The food unfortunately is not up to the standard of the hotel. This doesn't mean it's bad at all, yet nothing spectacular. And last but not least the best part is that it has the best location!Dear CutbertoParraNicolin, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
The St. Regis New York,1,Poor service from start to finish,"Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution. We hope to be at your service again soon and, until then, please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may need.Kind Regards,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"
The St. Regis New York,3,Somehow dissapointed but still a grand dame,"This was my second stay at the St Regis NY. The hotel has been revamped is much more expensive bit i can't say it has much improved. On the bright side: got an upgrade and a very nice room, late checkout, the concierges are knowledgeable and get you in difficult places like the Polo Bar across the street.downsides: the Ducasse restaurant is gone and hasn't been replaced so you're left with a somewhat lame breakfast/diner lounge. The King Cole must be run trotskyists since i was refused entry before midnight despite identifying myself as an hotel guest. I duly complained and next day was served a deliberate over spicy bloody mary in what felt like retaliation. The hotel as a butler service that packs your stuff on demand. I lost i cherished Lanvin fedora on the process without so much of an excuse. Considering the price you pay you can find better options in NY. By the way i'm an SPG Gold so the upgrades and late check outs come with the status.Dear Joao C, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted. I may be reached at Octavia.margineanstregis.com, and we would then be able to arrange a time at your convenience to speak.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
The St. Regis New York,5,Excellent hotel,"What a place. Brought the wife for a business trip and she and I both loved it. Great location and the staff treat to your every needs.

The St. Regis New York,5,Understated elegance,"With an air of urban sophistication and a location that can't be beat The St. Regis occupies the corner of 5th and 55th only blocks from Central Park, MOMA and the best retail shopping in America. On a cold winter afternoon loaded with bags displaying the logos of the finest brands guests are greeted at the elevator with a choice of hot apple cider, chocolate or beef broth. Recently remodeled rooms are roomy by NYC standards and fresh and of course the Butler service puts it's over the top. I don't think you can find a better lounge for a casual drink then the King Cole Bar. Don't miss the Bloody Mary menu (a drink that was invented here). An oasis, a grand hotel, a total pleasure.Dear Gene B,Thank you very much for your kind words about our hotel. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay in a renovated room and were able to enjoy our holiday hot chocolate offering. We hope you have a wonderful holiday season and we look forward to seeing you again in 2015.Best Regards,Manuel MartinezHotel Manager"
The St. Regis New York,3,"smile is perfect,but","I have stayed for New Year's Holiday.I was looking forward to visiting this hotel very very much. and I requested to them that I would like a high floor at their web site while reservation. as a result,my timeline on arrival day is following.11:30 arrival at Hotel,and deposit luggage. the representative of reception saidWe accept your request. at this time.15:45 Challenge for the first check-in. But the another representative told me that Check-intime start from 16:00.16:00 2nd challenge to check-in. new another representative said the inspection of your room hasn't complete yet. wait for several minute the long line made by waiting check-in people were appeared from this time. 16:15 3rd challenge to check-in. next another representative said the inspection isn't yet.wait for 5-10min. I answered OK,I wait for at here(front desk) the long line has become much longer.16:50 4th challenge to check-in. no one tell me anything.I try to talk to another person who stand the next of front desk I am waiting for 45 minutes,Whyto tell you the truth,I had expected this time a little.because I thought this waiting time was the time to find the highfloor room I requested. 17:00 check-in done.the room assigned to me was...the most lowest floor(3rd).there are 20 floors in this hotel and I had requested higher floorsince 2 month ago,But the answer was the most lowest level.I was so sad...so sad. the attached picture is the View from this room.If the assigned floor was 4th floor,I think I was saved from this sadness.But 3rd...the most lowest floor to the guest who request high floor.I know this season is very busy.I don't want to complain more than that.The hospitality and smile of their staffs were very good.I'll stay this hotel again.maybe this month.Dear 376masatot, Thank you very much for feedback about your recent stay with us.

The St. Regis New York,5,Classic Hotel,"I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

The St. Regis New York,3,"The Good, the Bad the Ugly at the St Regis!","The good First let's talk about the great things at this flagship hotel and there are so many! The location is in my opinion is as good as it gets in NYC! Two blocks from Saks, Museum of Modern Art and St Patrick's Cathedral, one block from Madison Ave, three blocks from Central Park and the city's best restaurants within easy walking distance. Everything is at your fingertips! The architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and St Regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring, 24 carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers, all as you would expect and more. The Christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning! Hats off to the extraordinary designer!The rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers, crystal chandeliers, deep crown moldings, luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks, TV in the mirror, deep soaker tub, separate shower and European-style private flush. The beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world. The full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well. They look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly. Fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished. Wi-Fi is included, as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service. The mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers. The rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean! All the staff are friendly from the doormen, waiters, maids, valets, etc. We opted out for the Platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in Astor Court with a nice menu selection, well prepared and quickly served.The Bad Being an SPG member for 16 years with over 900 nights to date and Lifetime Platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the SPG policy. It is something we have always received at all SPG properties, 100 of the time since gaining Platinum status many, many years ago. We booked this trip six months in advance so it wasn't like they didn't know we were coming. We even processed our Suite Nights Awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade. We had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire Dec 31/15 they are useless to us now. Our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded. It went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade. She didn't seem to understand the Platinum perks. Talking with her was like talking to a wall, so unlike other 5-star hotels we've stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed. We were shown to our Grand Luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go. I will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets. Over the years I hate to think what my husband has spent at SPG hotel stays to have earned his Lifetime Platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve. Not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as 154 nights in one year alone with SPG. He was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to NYC on a Thanksgiving holiday since 1985 when we met and had our very first trip together! Of course when you don't get a suite you don't get the toiletries that go with it which I've always loved at the St Regis. I suppose I could have requested it but I didn't. We just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holiday.The Ugly Staying at the hotel for a week, one of the expected highlights was Thanksgiving Dinner at Astor Court. We thought we'd stay in-house after long hours watching the Macy's Parade. Huge mistake! Upon arrival at Astor Court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with 2 tiny bar chairs! We couldn't believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date The meal was worse then I can describe and actually included processed turkey! Not even real turkey. I couldn't understand why I was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner. Now I know! No one in their right mind would pay 400 USD for that miserable meal for two people. I can't adequately describe our disappointment. We have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as New Year's Eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid. We couldn't even eat the salads. What kind of chef can't make a salad. Seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking. Talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a 200 credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for Thanksgiving Dinner! That just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her. I don't think I could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully I can't blame him. It's a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a 5-star dining room! After visiting 6 other St Regis Hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their NYC hotel just doesn't even make sense!Dear Katherine B,Thank you for taking the time to submit your recent review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our leadership team has been in touch with you while you were on property and again after your stay. We truly hope to regain your trust and wish you all the best for the holiday season. Kindly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"

The St. Regis New York,5,An unforgetable experience to spend Thanksgiving 2016 in an one of a kind luxury world class place!,"Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel.

The St. Regis New York,5,St Regis is the best hotel in New York by far,"I stayed at St Regis for 3 days this weekend and I was treated like a king.This is an amazingly beautiful hotel right at 5th ave.From the moment you walk in you feel special.The service and the staff were amazing and the butler service they have adds to the value.Dear Hagopyouredjian, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

The St. Regis New York,5,"If you get the chance, stay here","I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves. Thank you for taking the time to review our property on TripAdvisor, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"
The St. Regis New York,5,Fantastic stay!,"Just got back from an amazing weekend at the St. Regis. We used our starpoints to reserve a night at the St. Regis in celebration of our anniversary. I had high hopes for a Category 7 hotel - and St. Regis did not disappoint! We'd had a bit of a rough journey, but from the moment Pascal took our bags to Jose at the front desk checking us in, Ildna showing me to the fitness room where I could have a little workout before our room was ready - everyone took such great care of us. We will definitely be back!Dear Traveller94115, We are very pleased to learn that Pascal, Jose and Ilona all provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.

The St. Regis New York,5,A ness of elegance and beauty at Central Park,"Welcome to one of the most iconic and beautiful hotels of Manhattan! Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel.

The St. Regis New York,5,MAGNIFICENT ATTENTION TO DETAIL,"We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests. Also, thank you for the constructive feed-back regarding front service and butlers. Rest assured, it will be addressed.

The St. Regis New York,5,Wow... just a fantastic experience.,"I stayed here with my wife to celebrate her 30th birthday. At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at to date (definitely top 3)Dear jamGolf3, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures and your celebration! We do hope you will be back to stay with us soon and ask that you please let us know when you are returning! We would love to have you as our guest in the future!Kindly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"

The St. Regis New York,4,Gorgeous! with a little hicupp,"We arrived by chance at the St.Regis after the Waldorf failed to provide us with an updated room. The St. Regis was very beautifully appointed and the front desk staff was very accommodating as well. We needed a larger room as we were having guests joins us for dessert and drinks and although there was an additional charge 1,000 more for the room, it was just what we needed and really pretty. The room however, was with out a view, or rather with a view of other building walls, so in the morning it was a bit dreary and dark. If you book a room at the St. Regis, make sure to ask for a high floor or you will be in darkness, despite the wonderful dcor and amenities.Dear Dirwpgops, Thank you for taking the time to detail your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your larger room but are dissapointed that you were not pleased with the view. Should you ever encounter this again, kindly contact our Front Desk team to see if we have alternative options for you. Thank you again and we hope to see you again soon.With warm regards,Pedro RodriguezDirector of Front Office"
The St. Regis New York,5,Classic style and service,"Attention to detail was incredible at one of New York City's finest hotels.Our suite was beautiful, and despite being worried about traffic noise, we were surprised to have had a very restful night. We used travel points to book our room, and were very impressed to have been upgraded to a better room - this is excellent service and excellent recognition that people who travel all the time rarely cash in their points, but when they do ... it leaves a lasting impression and a very much increased likelihood that we will return and also highly recommend.Well done!Dear SuenearBoston, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

The St. Regis New York,5,delicious snack before the evening play,"I stayed at Ritz-Carlton Hotel during my last visit.However, St. Regis is located right on the 5th avenue where I dropped by twice.Once for a afternoon tea at Astor Court, after a long busy day. Varieties of sandwiches and scones were nicely served, just like they do at Ritz, London, I skipped dinner on that evening.The next evening I dropped by to have light snack before evening play. The club sandwich was a simple menu but the most delicious I have had. The over all service is excellent.I would definitely stay at this hotel if it situated near the Central Park, like Ritz-Carlton.Dear spaniel12, On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for sharing the details of your recent visit to Astor Court on TripAdvisor.At The St. Regis New York, we pride ourselves on our personalized service, and we are so glad that you were able to experience this first hand.Please let us know when you will be returning to New York, as we would love to welcome you back as our guest.Sincerely,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
The St. Regis New York,4,Small and adorable.,"Nice spacious rooms, good location . The only thing bad about it is that they don't have buffet breakfast and it takes lot of time to get a table and it becomes quite expensive too. 2 of the mornings, I was offered high chairs of bar for breakfast which is not ideal when you pay about 60 dollars for simple omlette, juice and black coffee. But overall very good.Dear neeraj821,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York, and thank you for your comments regarding breakfast. We will share your feedback with our team for review, and appreciate your thoughts. We hope to see you again soon.Kindly,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
The St. Regis New York,5,The Perfect NY Hotel,"From the moment we checked in to our last minute there, the service was world class. The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY. What a wonderful 5 star experience!Dear Dan B,We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.Thank you for your time and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

The St. Regis New York,5,Super Premium Experince,"If you want to experience the perfect city hotel in New York with everything from service, location and friendliness this is perfect.We spend Christmas here and it was amazing. The room was very nice, quiet and with a fantastic bed and everything. The service at the reception was very good and also during the rest of the stay.The butler service was also very good. We will definitely come back. The only thing that can be improved are the lights at breakfast, it was to bright so you missed a little bit of the coziness.Dear Andrew18985,Thank you for taking the time to review your stay at The St. Regis New York. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time with us, and hope that you will return to NYC soon. We thank you for your comments regarding the lights at breakfast.

The St. Regis New York,5,Something very special about St. Regis,"In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoy staying here, and we deeply appreciate your loyalty. We will share your kind words with Jie, and look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmest Regards, Daniela CataldoDirector of Rooms"
The St. Regis New York,3,Resting Comfortably on Past Glory,"Stayed here to catch NYC at Christmas and were excited to stay in a legendary hotel. We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay. Dear NOIDK, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted. Our management team may be reached at GeneralManagerNYStRegis.com, and we would then be able to arrange a time at your convenience to speak.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"

Miyako Hotel Los Angeles,5,convenient in downtown LA,"Bad: I understand it is a japanese hotel but the American breakfast was terrible. I appreciate that they had all options, but the eggs weren't well cooked, the bacon wasn't cooked and for that it was expensive. there is no room service and for the hour i had to be at my conference it was hard to get out extra early to find a diner nearby. some didn't open in time. It was a buffet so super fast... I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them. Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant."

I heard my neighbor sneeze, and I felt horrible coughing at night for fear of disturbing other floors! Parking and walking to the room was long and difficult with many bags. Limited hotel parking with expensive rates. Public parking becomes the only option, and while not as terribly inconvenient as you would think, it would still be nice if Miyako had their own, larger facilities. Good: Amazing location, and very cool bidet feature in the bathrooms. Spacious size rooms in the executive suites for the price value. AC kicks on very fast and cools the room nicely. Great views from floors higher up."
Miyako Hotel Los Angeles,4.6,PERFECT VENUE FOR JAPANESE CULTURE,Good: THE HOTEL NEEDS A BETTER COFFEE SHOP FOR QUICK BREAKFAST. WHAT EXISTS THERE IS ONLY OKAY...IT IS NOT INVITING OR OFFERS MUCH WARMTH.

We aren't fancy people but wanted to spoil ourselves for our anniversary. Good: We loved the location and the style of the hotel and the rooms. Caesar at the door was extremely welcoming and helpful."

Kinzie Hotel,4.6,Thank you Kinzie! We loved celebrating our anniversary at your property!,Bad: The bed/mattress was not as firm as I like. Good: The hotel staff was incredibly attentive and sent us a bottle or Prosseco and chocolate covered strawberries to help celebrate our anniversary. It was such a welcome surprise that really made our stay special. We also appreciated the drink tokens and lounge area with appetizers- made it very comfortable to stay there!
Kinzie Hotel,4.6,Good stay but a little pricey.,Bad: The street noise was pretty bad. Honking horns til all hours. Hard to sleep. Good: Loved the continental breakfast on every floor so you didn't have to go far. The staff was great and it was a great location.

Kinzie Hotel,3.25,It was clean.,"Bad: The website for hotel says happy hour food and a drink included. Nowhere on booking.com or Kinzie website does it mention that it's not included. So we were charged for it. I requested to have it removed and haven't heard back if they did so. But besides that, where the drinks/food is located is in a room with no windows/a dark cave. Not nice and not worth going to it. Sorry, nice thought but did not like. In this world of communication, it should be noted that there is a charge. Good: It was clean. Had good hair products. Bed and pillows were comfortable."

dana hotel and spa,4.8,I loved the decor.,"Bad: I didn't appreciate the attitude of a few of the female employees in regards to the nightclub. I also would prefer a little more variety in the DJ's music choice. It seemed like ALL techno versions and sometimes we just want to hear the ACTUAL songs mixed. Other than that, I loved the property. Good: I loved the decor. Everything about the hotel from the lobby to the room was fantastic. The wood floors, the floor-to-ceiling windows, the shower overlooking the bedroom... PHENOMENAL! I loved the modern, but still comfortable feel. All employees I came in contact with had fantastic customer service skills with the exception of a few in the nightclub. Overall, this property is definitely on my list of Chicago properties as we visit often. Next time we will try out the spa as we didn't get a chance this visit."

Kinzie Hotel,5,"The room and bathroom were spacious and very nice, very...","Bad: The only thing I wish there could have been is hot food choices for breakfast, such as eggs and bacon or sausage. I did like how they set up the breakfast on each floor. That was very nice, however, having a place to eat outside of our room would be nice. But knowing there isn't anywhere to do that I think you do an excellent job with everything. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you. Good: The room and bathroom were spacious and very nice, very clean and updated. We stayed in the deluxe king room. Staff were all very nice and helpful!"
dana hotel and spa,3.15,The majority of the staff was great.,"Bad: The check-in process was not good. I felt that I had been singled out as a young black male for staying at this hotel. Later, I also saw a young black male in the same situation as myself. In addition, every 45 minutes from 7:30 am - 11:45, I had housekeeping knock on the door twice, and two people walked in while my girlfriend and I were naked. Horrible experience. I called the next day to speak with the manager, left voice mails, and still no response!. Good: The majority of the staff was great."
Kinzie Hotel,5,Amazing hotel.,"Good: Wonderful, friendly staff and incredible location. Loved the happy hour and breakfast on each floor. Couldn't have done better for a first trip to Chicago."

Kinzie Hotel,3.95,"Great Location! Nice Rooms, Excellent Front Desk Staff.","Bad: Floors need to be vacuumed much better. Finding old snack food and candy is not what I would expect. It wasn't horrible, but noticeable. On 2 separate occasions we had hotel staff come into our room. First time was shortly after we arrived. Housekeeping was confused on which room she was to clean. No big deal. 2nd time was on Monday morning, about 9:30-10AM, someone opened our door without knocking, noticed we were in there and left. By the time I could get up and get to the door, look out, they were gone. This was VERY odd and concerning. Good: Location was fantastic. Front desk staff were outstanding."
dana hotel and spa,4.8,"Great location, roof top bar, chic decor.",Bad: Floor to ceiling see through glass in bathroom. Good: Large floor to ceiling windows overlooking downtown. Chic design.

Good: Great restaurant downstairs, room clean and modern, shower was like standing under a waterfall."
Kinzie Hotel,3.75,"Exceptional staff, nice rooms, bathrooms need updating.","Bathrooms need renovating. Were not on par with rest of room. My shower/tub did not drain, at all, and water was up past my ankles by the time I finished showering. Every staff person I encountered was exceptionally helpful, polite, and friendly. Rooms were a nice size and had nice amenities."
Kinzie Hotel,4.8,Great in all aspects,"Bad: The breakfast was missing couple of important parts, this is not a big deal since Chicago is full of amazing breakfast restaurants. Good: It was clean, modern and had big rooms with free breakfast."

Kinzie Hotel,3.75,Not great for family on Saturday nights,Bad: Saturday night was very loud inside and outside of hotel until 3:00 am. Good: accommodations were convenient and fine for stay in downtown
Kinzie Hotel,4.6,Very very good in Chicago,"Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list. The H.O.B was also great, but didn't have time to get down to Rosa's Bar or Kingston Mines. I'll leave that for the next time............................but will be staying at the Kinzie."
Kinzie Hotel,4.8,Great location and can't beat the happy hour on the 6th...,Good: Great location and can't beat the happy hour on the 6th floor
Kinzie Hotel,2.9,Bad service from the staff but best location.,"Bad: What I didnt like is the service of the staff. I reserved and paid last October a city view room, check in online on our way to the hotel and was assured key is waiting. But when we got there, no room available for city view. We were settled for a night in 3rd floor and we were assured the next 5nights we will be in the 6th floor. But the following day, they gave us a floor higher only, 4th floor. We cant see much of the city from 4th floor. All we can see is adjacent buildings. We were frustrated that there is no cafeteria for breakfast. Yeah, breakfast is included on the price but no chair to sit on, no table use. It is a grab and go breakfast. Very incovenient because breakfast is served in 5th and 6th floors's console table only. No microwave, no toaster. How can you eat the bagels they served in very cold temperature Secondly, we were not given instructions / info on our check in at the hotel what are the facilities they have for us. We only discovered while we were staying at the hotel. Like business center, fitness center,etc. The housekeeping, bad service! They forgot to replace the complimentary k-cup coffee. One day, they left a used pair of socks in our room. A pair of black socks rolled,dirty for a man whose size could be for a 6 footer and taller. My boys are only 5'3. Next day, they left again a wet soiled pink shirt on the table where the TV is. Why is that Everyday I always left as tip and a way of thank you for cleaning the room but all they leave is mess. Good: I like the location of this hotel. Very accessible to everything,from all kinds of food/resto to tourist attractions."
dana hotel and spa,4.15,Housekeeping was awesome !,Bad: Friendlier folks at the front desk...they are the first staff one interacts with at your hotel. They need to make eye contact and smile more. Interact with guests...make you feel welcome. Good: Housekeeping was awesome !!!

Kinzie Hotel,1.65,Not a four star.,"The reception desk guy at checkin was reckless. The breakfast is extremely poor (some apples, cakes and coffee) uncomfortably served in every corridor of each floor of the hotel. Comfort is absent, there is no soundproofing in the rooms facing the street, nor in the back. The use of ear plugs is mandatory and probably insufficient to reduce continuous noise (day and night) from heavy duty air conditioning equipment of many commercial buildings surrounding the hotel. The Hotel offers extremely poor value for money. It is not a four (4) stars at all. Staying there was hard and exhausting. AVOID IT. Suitable cleanliness and location."
Kinzie Hotel,3.75,Loved the free breakfast,Bad: Used my debit card to pay for room.. Normally charges are taken out day you leave but they took them out day I arrived then charged 76 extra just incase I broke or damaged something-they said I would get it back but it was still pended out of my account. Good: Loved the free breakfast

dana hotel and spa,4.6,The staff were super friendly and helpful.,Bad: The water wasn't super hot the first day (maybe it was time of day) and there was no way to adjust the temperature of the room. Good: The staff were super friendly and helpful. The rooms were quaint but classy. Loved the balcony. The in-room wine selection was pretty neat. I'll definitely come back to experience more of what they have to offer.

Long Island Iced Tea missing a few ingredients, King Alphonse was actually a Kahlua and cream with ice. Ugh. In-room coffee machine didn't work, took two days to get fixed, and then made awful coffee. Morning coffee from the restaurant was undrinkable. Thankfully, Starbucks nearby. Good: Best restaurant for dinner of any hotel anywhere. Entrees superb, bread pudding beyond superb. Excellent security staff -- Cheerfully and efficiently retrieved my forgotten keyboard, assured me it was safe, and FedExed it to me no charge. Decor stylish, cozy room made clever use of small space, room clean, rain shower nice. Non-convention type hotel very appealing. Really great value in accessible walkable location."

Kinzie Hotel,2.3,"On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine -...","Bad: Overall I was very disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt. For the cost: Paid over 450/night for lowest price 1person room - highly overpriced, and overrated reviews I have to say. I was attending last minute trip for work, but wish I had chosen the Monaco, Drake, Intercontinental...Hyatt, Sheraton...anywhere else. For someone traveling on business, I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree, for four times the cost. Freebies: I didn't have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfast/snacks in evening, as I had to be out at other events, which already provided this. I didn't need the free internet as I had my own. Room Itself: This was probably the worst aspect, yet the most important, and what prompted my very negative rating. I overlooked a rusty building roof - wish I had taken a picture as I don't need gorgeous, but this was anything but. It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease. I would have closed the blinds...but they were blackout blinds...which you don't want if waking up at 5-6 for work events. The room was lackluster, and though there are only 6 floors, there are 2 VERY slow elevators, one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay, so don't try to get anywhere on time, or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse. Overall: I expected more when I saw the cost, positive ratings, the reviews for boutique - this was anything but. Disappointing stay, especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday. Will not be returning. Good: On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine - the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant. Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly. Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departure...but again, not something that makes hotel stand out."

Kinzie Hotel,3.55,The bed was comfortable with a really good sized bathroom.,"Bad: The hotel has no real public areas, and there's a facilities fee which I didn't realize. The reception staff weren't that helpful. The room wasn't quiet enough for a really good night's sleep due to loud aircon and some other random noise that persisted even with aircon off. Good: The bed was comfortable with a really good sized bathroom. WiFi was good."
Kinzie Hotel,4.6,good choice,"Bad: The continental breakfast (not many options on the fooditems) served each floor on the lobby and eating in the room. Good: Excellent location, clean, confortble and easy to acces"

Kinzie Hotel,4.8,Super comfortable beds and free breakfast,"Bad: Used my credit card to hold reservation but was going to pay cash. When I checked out they said they already processed my credit card and would not refund it and l could not pay cash. I am from Canada and have a US bank account so when the Can and US dollars were at par I put my travel money into it. By paying with my credit card, I ended up paying an extra 150 in exchange rate and user fees. They also charged my credit card the day I booked- which I didn't know until my statement came in. Good: beds were very comfortable. breakfast in hallway every morning very convenient. location was good-very close to river and a couple of blocks from metro stations. Staff very friendly."

dana hotel and spa,4.15,Great location and lovely rooms,"Bad: On one day breakfast was downstairs and was too small and tight a space for number of guests. Good: Beds comfortable, mini bar reasonably priced fab location"
Kinzie Hotel,3.15,"Staff was wonderful, overall clean quiet hotel but not very comfortable.","The bath tub was rusty..literally, mildew along the edge, and small. The bed was very hard and uncomfortable. The Free 14.95 breakfast was terrible, couldn't drink the coffee it was so bitter and nothing hot was offered. The room ended up being 100 more than advertised after all the taxes and what was supposed to be free breakfast... Location"
Kinzie Hotel,4.15,Beautiful hotel with excellent location,"Bad: There was no complimentary bottle of water. If you need water, you need to buy from the mini bar. For the breakfast, wish there were more hot food. Good: Liked the fact there was breakfast on every floor and enjoyed the drinks in the evening."
dana hotel and spa,5,I had someone partying and playing super loud music above me...,Bad: I had someone partying and playing super loud music above me or next to me all night. Got no sleep.
dana hotel and spa,4.15,"Location and room/decor, amenities","Bad: The music in the lobby was horrendous. House music that made me want to die or run away with my hands over my ears. Totally cruel to make the hotel receptionists listen to that all day long and it made the lobby an undesirable place to spend time. They should be playing jazz or something easy on the ears. Good: Location and room/decor, amenities"
Kinzie Hotel,4.6,Nice happy hour drink.,Bad: Soft mattress on the bed. Good: Nice happy hour drink. Nice breakfast buffet. Large room in great location.

Kinzie Hotel,4.6,We had a really rude man greet us at the check in counter.,Bad: We had a really rude man greet us at the check in counter. When my dad didn't understand what he was asking he gave him such an attitude. Everything else was perfect except for that encounter.
Kinzie Hotel,5,The convienance to everything.,Good: The convienance to everything. Just by walking out the front door of Kinzie Hotel.
Kinzie Hotel,5,We would certainly stay with you again! Good location!,Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun. Made some new friends!
Kinzie Hotel,3.75,"Great neighborhood, small place to stay with good service .",Bad: Not much of a view. Good: Great location. Small hotel with good service. Lots of pillows:)

Kinzie Hotel,5,Amazing experience and location! Couldn't have picked a better hotel than the Kinzie,"Bad: I wanted to watch Netflix and couldn't, BUT THEY SAID NETFLIX WAS COMING!! By the end of August the hotel is getting new TV system to watch my shows! So my one negative will be fixed!!. Good: The staff was amazingly friendly! Breakfast was on each guest room floor and got to have breakfast in bed!! Free food and drink in the lounge every night. It was so easy to get around the city. Most of it was within walking distance, but I took the L to Wrigley Field. Super Easy! Free Wifi as well."
Kinzie Hotel,5,Fantastic hotel with fantastic staff.,"Bad: Absolutely nothing!. Good: Such a relaxing hotel in the hub of the city. Breakfast located on each floor next to the lift was great, bed was sooo comfy, bathroom fab and the view stunning. Cocktail hour with nibbles each night was such a nice touch. What makes the Kinzie thou are the staff!"
Kinzie Hotel,5,Comfort relaxed,Good: Best sleep I've had at a hotel
Kinzie Hotel,3.75,Why didn't I know about Kinzie West That is what you...,"Bad: Why didn't I know about Kinzie West That is what you show in your ads, but I got only the highest floor of the Unwest Kinzie. I was expecting a better view of the city."
Kinzie Hotel,4.6,The view of the alley way buildings,Bad: The view of the alley way buildings.
dana hotel and spa,4.15,Over all it was very nice. Not sure I would stay again .If they don't change the mattress out .,Bad: When two people sleep in the bed you settle to the middle of bed and makes for a uncomfortable night's rest. Good: The hotel location and the room layout and scenery was very nice.
Moxy Chicago Downtown,2,Not for Business Travel,"Stayed a few days while on business, big mistake. I don't want an experience from my Hotel - I want value for my money. No Closet, No dressers, No coffee maker, No Frig, No Microwave, No Bathtub, No Iron, No ice machines, No room service, No Workspace and of course no free breakfast. They give you a poker chip for one free coffee or drink. It is geared towards those who don't need any of these amenities and want to hang out in a noisy bar environment for your computer work. They give you a small tray table about 15x15 inches to work on in your room, that doesn't cut it for me. I get the revenue play with putting more rooms in a much small piece of real estate but for the nightly cost, a business traveler can find much nicer hotels in Chicago. I would suggest an improvement would be to have a fold up table on the wall and a chair at least. Traveler beware if your are on business (especially a women) this is most likely not the place for you - unless you just want tacos and the free lollypop from room service. I think the Do Not Disturb sign with the young guy in his under ware hugging a teddy bear says it all."
dana hotel and spa,5,loved every thing about this hotel,"Good: the location was perfect, the hotel spa was very good with variety of service, the staff were extra friendly the room was clean. would defiantly come again."
Kinzie Hotel,4.8,Staff was extremely helpful.,"Bad: View. We had a view of an alley. But, that's the only downside. Good: Staff was extremely helpful. Rooms were well-appointed, clean and functional."

Kinzie Hotel,4.15,Nice amenities but beds should be replaced.,"Bad: The bed was very uncomfortable. Lumpy and too soft. Good: Central location. Easy check-in and out. Nice touches. Access to breakfast on each floor with a tray to use in your room-protein from hard boiled egg and yogurt, fresh baked goods, cereal (hot and cold). Fitness center had a variety of cardio equipment and weights."
Kinzie Hotel,4.8,Location was near sightseeing.,"Bad: Parking was expensive at 62 for 1 night, and o thought it was included but it wasn't. Good: Location was near sightseeing."
Kinzie Hotel,5,All the staff was genuinely friendly.,Good: All the staff was genuinely friendly.
Kinzie Hotel,3.75,Staff was nice and helpful.,Bad: The complimentary breakfast was not good at all. Kinda a joke. Very disappointing. For the money we spent for the room we expected a bit more. Good: Staff was nice and helpful. Room was clean and somewhat nice.

Montage Beverly Hills,3.25,Rather poor for the price of a nights stay.,Bad: Dropped in for advice on a good Japanese restaurant. The concierge seemed perplexed and said he would call or email with info. He never did. In fact there was a great sushi just in front of the hotel. Very strange. When I called the concierge from outside the hotel I was put on hold and left on hold. I could have died on hold. The rooms need a facelift and I have stayed in better for half the price. The restaurant for breakfast is soulless and very expensive and not up to much. Regarding the above you have many comments on TripAdvisor about the same so why not do something about it. Good: Joyce the concierge ( I think that was her name) made up for the others who probably couldn't find Los Angeles on the map. The pool. The location That's it.
Montage Beverly Hills,3.15,I will not stay at montage hotel again,Bad: They don't even offer you some water or a complementary drink or fruit. Comparing to the charges.
Montage Beverly Hills,4.4,Location and comfort,Good: Location and comfort
Montage Beverly Hills,4.8,What not to like about this property !,"Bad: The prices of the SPA treatment are quite expensive. If you go to most expensive SPA in Dubai the treatment can varies between USD 120 for normal facial cleansing up to USD 500 or 600 for a full package of 4 hours . Yet here the minimum starts at USD 280/- excluding the taxes ! . Good: What not to like about this property !!! Everything was great. The location, the spacious rooms the view the room service the in room dining the restaurants even the Spa. Ok I didn't try the spa due to my busy schedule but it looked so good (although the prices of the treatments were quite expensive). Some people thing that the hotel is a bit expensive, well it is located in one of the most prestigious and expensive districts in LA. It is just located on the famous Rodeo Drive. The rooms were big. I advise you to not take the room with balconies if you know your self won't use it. The balcony takes space out of the room. My most concerns and worries normally in any hotel is the cleanness of the bathroom and toilets and here it was just perfect."
Montage Beverly Hills,4.4,"Helpful staff, excellent service, comfort, location, luxury.","Bad: Insufficient service at the reception, had to wait at check in and out, only 1 or 2 staff. Good: Helpful staff, excellent service, comfort, location, luxury."

Montage Beverly Hills,3.75,Location.,Good: Location.
Montage Beverly Hills,4.4,"Fantastic location, great personal attention from the staff.","Bad: Even tough considered an exlusive hotel it is quite expensive for what you get and the hotel parking is way too expensive. The TV location in the room is a bit forced and not so comfortable from all angles. Good: Fantastic location, great personal attention from the staff. Very clean."
Montage Beverly Hills,4.15,The gentleman at reception and the valets,Bad: Dirty windows in the room dirty carpet in hallway and dirty door for service entrance 3 rd floor. Good: The gentleman at reception and the valets
Montage Beverly Hills,3.55,The location of the hotel is amazing.,"Bad: The Parq Bar menu is extremely poor. The hotel charges 6 delivery fees for room service! There is no open buffet option for breakfast. The breakfast area is understaffed, and the 1 or 2 waiters/waitresses there are slow and inefficient. Good: The location of the hotel is amazing. The Parq Bar atmosphere at night is very nice. The concierge service in the hotel is very efficient."
Montage Beverly Hills,5,Super hotel,Bad: I dont like the anchovies in the Caesar dressing. Good: Bed and pillows are the best

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.15,ber cool.,"Bad: Initially had a two double bedded room (later switched) and the beds in this room were too small and woefully uncomfortable. Mattresses were sub standard. However, were swiftly moved to much more comfortable king bedded room. Good: ber cool. Tech savvy property with atmospheric bar area and games room. Very accommodating, knowledgeable and friendly front front desk staff. King rooms are spacious and comfortable Location could not be better."
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,5,Great location.,Good: Great location. Staff was amazing
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,2.5,Modern but old facilities and lumpy beds,Bad: Beds were uncomfortable. The hotel is a lot older than what it may seem in the pictures. Good: Modern decor.
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,2.7,Great location but staff would benefit from hospitality related training.,Bad: Staff were not particularly knowledgeable about the charges applied to the bill. Desk staff indifferent to customers.
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,2.5,I liked that the lobby was filled with fun games and a great...,"Bad: The property tries so hard to be trendy that it actually made it very difficult to stay as a family. There was only one pillow each, three towels for four people and a tightly restricted supply of coffee- only two, environmentally unfriendly, pods. The oddest part was there were no teaspoons, only stirrers and amazingly no kettle- and only two mugs for four people. We had to bother house keeping just to bring a kettle up to make tea (also not supplied). This hotel sells trendy box water for 8 which pretty much sums up how far off the mark this place is with practicalities. Trendy sure, but practical and sensible...no. Reminded me of of a start up thats well funded but just silly. Also the rooms air conditioning setting included jet engine or off so that was extremely uncomfortable. I wouldnt stay here again given they also have an odd naughty drawer and I needed to explain to my 7 year old what sex dust was. Extremely odd place to stay as a family. Good: I liked that the lobby was filled with fun games and a great bar which was very relaxed and welcoming."
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,5,Great place. Great location. Great staff.,"Bad: Would've loved a bit larger rooms. We ended up having to get a second room for our kids (older kids) since the suite was simply too tight for all of us. My husband said the mattress was about ready to be replaced. And we thought it was funny that there was a sign on the toiletries, saying that they would charge for these if taken home. But overall, we really had a great time and loved the environment. Good: Loved the staff - very friendly and helpful with good recommendations. We loved the attached restaurant for coffee and breakfast. The overall atmosphere was very cool and well done. And the location for us was great."
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.75,"Central location, nice rooms, comfortable bed.","Bad: One person a touch too familiar / jokey at reception when checking in and out, but not really a problem. She certainly wasn't rude. Some might think it adds character. Good: Central location, nice rooms, comfortable bed. We could shop happily in the Westfield Mall right next door and In Market Street / Union Square."
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.8,Nice staff,Bad: Expensive. Adding tha taxes become heavy. Good: New age. Excellant service
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.6,"Great place to stay, near-by town down as well as conference center.","Good: Really quiet rooms due to perfect shielded windows. Never saw better ones in SF.

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.8,Fab!,Bad: N/a. Good: Modern and fabulous
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.4,A stylish hotel with convenient location,Bad: We had a deluxe double room which can accommodate up to 4 persons. We had three adults. The bed was a bit small for 2 persons and we couldn't add one more bed because of fire restriction. Good: I like the clean and simple design of the room. Beds are comfortable and the room is rather spacious. I also like the amenities. The location is also good - Bart station is round the corner and the shopping area is just next door.
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.6,"I love the rustic modern decor, the size of my room and...","Bad: Did not like the fact that there was no restaurant on premises. Good: I love the rustic modern decor, the size of my room and bathroom. Also, front desk staff was very friendly."

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.6,GREAT PROPERTY FALSE Advertising GAME ROOM CLOSED,Bad: I booked this property for their GAME ROOM IT WAS CLOSED FOR A PRIVATE EVENT!!! That was very dissapointing because I was with teenagers that could not be in the bar area and needed something to do. I thought it was wrong to advertise a game room that is continously not available because of private party's. And I stayed on a Thursday I'm sure it's worse on the weekends. Good: The renovation looks great. The bar downstairs is great with late night food.
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,3.5,big new room with good light,Bad: Too expensive for simple facility. One day the shower did not work in the morning for 3 hours. Internet connection was terrible and not stable. Connecting to internet was difficult. Fitness facility too small. Good: big new room with good light

It was nice they provided water and snack bar was stocked with a variety of things. Good: Central to lots of sites and walking around is convenient"
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,3.75,Convenient location for business and classes in SOMA.,"Bad: The room smelled of spoiled food and there was hair from a drain left in the toilet when I arrived. Also mold on the grout in the shower. I would have asked to change rooms, but I was in a hurry to get to an appointment. Good: Location and exceptional staff. Especially the front desk and valet staff."
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.15,Enjoyed our stay at Zetta.,"Bad: The neighbourhood is a little seedy, but understand that is part of the city's charm!. Good: Enjoyed our stay at Zetta."
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,5,Fabolous boutique hotel in central San Francisco,"Good: The staff were professional, friendly and eager to please. It was our anniversary and a lovely bottle of wine was waiting for us on arrival which was a really lovely touch. The Cavalier bar/restaurant is super and make sure you have Liam mix up one of his fabulous cocktails! Very central location but nice and quite hotel."
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.4,"Close to shopping, cable cars, and street cars. Great game room and friendly staff.","Bad: The valet parking is more expensive than at other hotels. However, we were able to find parking around the corner for 30 less. Good: The staff were very friendly and helpful with questions regarding the best way to reach sites. The game room on the second floor was fantastic and not at all crowded which is what I had anticipated. The hotel photos are exactly what you see when you arrive (this is often not the case with other hotels I've stayed in)."
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.4,"1) Location, perfect for walking around city","Bad: 1) Noisy A/C Unit 2) Lack of hooks in bathroom on which to hang towels (only one in the bathroom we had). Good: 1) Location, perfect for walking around city 2) Design excellent 3) Comfortable bed and room 4) Staff friendliness"
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.8,Trendy hotel in the heart of the city,Bad: No breakfast option and it was pricy to park every day. But nothing major. Good: Very modern and trendy property with very clean and spacious rooms at the heart of San Francisco. We had fun in the games room and enjoyed a drink at the bar after a long day of walking
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.8,"Rooms were big and very clean, the smell of the room was...","Bad: Nothing. Good: Rooms were big and very clean, the smell of the room was awesome. The staff are very friendly and the location is perfect"

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.6,The games room was a blast,Good: The games room was a blast
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,2.3,Not great. Don't believe the hype.,"Bad: The hotel just didn't quite match up to the pics we saw online. The room was quite dirty, a few hairs were on the one bathrobe that I guess we were suppose to share between two. No help with bags on arrival or departure. No complimentary water. Shower was not clean at all and light above it was out. Had to ask three times for it to be changed. Grout had gone silver and the actual tiles hadn't been properly cleaned in ages, you could tell by marks that appeared when it steamed up. Toilet was all yellowed around the seat rim. Splashes on wallpaper down back of toilet and across from toilet too. Toiletries provided in large bottles where the tops of the pumps had ingrained dirt. Horrible. Floor in room was covered in marks and the windows were filthy. It all smelt a bit stale too. Lighting is low I think to hide what's actually not very clean. Drawers were full of little bits of white dust and paper, clearly never been checked or cleaned. Ironing board was so bad you had to put two towels on it to avoids marks on clothing. We got an ok deal through booking.com but had we paid full rate I would've been really unhappy. Location just wasn't for us, right by Union square, we would've preferred somewhere more local but other people may like that. First room we were given had a great view of a... wall. :( Breakfast not provided yet no suggestions of where to go when there's an amazing diner a block away. Staff (apart from the girl who checked us in) weren't very helpful at all. Good: The bed was comfy"

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,3.15,"Ok for a few nights, terribly noisy","Bad: Beds are creaky, thin walls you can hear everything from the room next door and hallway. Housekeeping isnt consistent. Laundry delivery to the wrong room. Good: Location"
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.8,Fab hotel. Funky. Good location. Huge rooms,"Bad: Not really anything to do with the hotel but we were only in San Fran for a few days and found we spent a lot of time travelling down to the pier for Alcatraz, cycling across the bridge etc. Buses take a long time (so do taxis though) and although walkable (about an hour) if you've only got limited time in the City you might want to think about staying nearer to the Piers or Financial District. Good: Great location for Union Square and surrounding area. Hotel was funky and rooms were HUGE. Great bonus after a long haul flight and when there are two friends sharing."
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.8,Excellent location.,Good: Excellent location. Staff very friendly. Bedroom very clean.
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,3.95,"Nice hotel, not sure about the location",Bad: The area around the hotel is a bit rough with the tenderloin being so close the streets around the hotel are not the nicest. You really have to get an uber or use public transport to get somewhere for a nice walk in the evening. The one positive on the location is that you are near to a transport hub so easy to get away from the area. Good: Hotel facilities were great. Breakfast at the restaurant was good and the bar served nice cocktails. Lots of games are bonus when waiting for people or something to do before bed. The hotel rooms are comfortable and spacious.
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.6,Central location good vibes,"Bad: Breakfast. Good: Central location, Efficient kind staff, Nice Lounge/bar area"

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,4.6,Fabulous location!!,Bad: Lighting in room. Good: Location staff
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,3.75,"The hotel is super stylish, the room was perfect.","Bad: The Wi-Fi works with a portal login, I had to log-in like 5 times each day for every device I was using, even if I hadn't left the room. Super annoying and I'd say enough reason for any business traveller to avoid an otherwise super nice hotel. Good: The hotel is super stylish, the room was perfect. The hotel feels new clean throughout. Nice atmosphere in the bar area."
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,5,Trendy and Fun!,"Bad: Appetizers at the bar could have been better. No view but we weren't looking for that. Hot tub would have been nice. Good: We got a great price though Booking.com at this awesome boutique hotel. Felt like we won the lottery. The decor in the lobby, bar and room was trendy. They have a game room with pool, shuffle board, ping pong, giant jenga, and a Wii. My boyfriend and I had it all to ourselves one night. We keep getting drinks from the bar and we had a blast. Didn't need to go out that night! We booked there because we wanted to be in walking distance of the Giants game at ATT park. Had a great time at the game even though Giants lost that one. We like the exercise room. They actually had more than just treadmills! We liked it because we like to lift weights and we were able to get a moderate workout. Book it!"

Hotel Zetta San Francisco,5,My preference for a mattress is more on the harder side so...,Bad: My preference for a mattress is more on the harder side so my back was rather sore in the mornings after waking up. But it seems like most American hotels have rather soft beds so I am not sure if this is something that bothers other people or not.
Hotel Zetta San Francisco,5,I don't write reviews ever. This was worth writing a great review for.,"Good: The staff is above and beyond friendly, and it's not insincere. Just great personality. Upgraded our room for my gf's birthday, and a complimentary bottle of wine. Nice touch!"

"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",1,Would NEVER Recommend!,Overall miserable experience. Front desk was very unresponsive from start to finish at this Hilton location. Manager had a very confrontational attitude and certainly does not treat her guest like I am accustom at other higher end Hilton properties. She certainly makes it clear your word isn't good enough unless she can see the messed up room details for herself.... More
"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",3,All good except the front desk customer service,"Good location, nice breakfasts. Front desk customer service leaves a lot to be desired. The staff were pleasant sometimes and indifferent to rude at other times. Never received my room upgrade either."
"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,Great family location,Great spot with kids and family. Would definitely stay here again. Clean rooms and friendly staff. Convenient to reading market. Nice to have breakfast included and hot coffee available all day. Kids loved the pool - although it was small.
"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,"Fantastic Location, Great Staff","The hotel is ideally located in center city across the street from Reading Terminal market. They did a nice job modernizing this hotel. It is also very clean. Check in was great. I was in town for the night and booked a room last minute. I had 4 adults in one room and when I booked the only available option was 1 queen and 1 sofa bed in a room. I asked if they have any rooms available with 2 beds and they were able to accommodate me last minute which was great. Also at checkin they provided 2 cold bottles of water which was a nice touch. The room was very clean nice. The rooms have a full refrigerator, sink, microwave, dishwasher, coffee machine. The bathroom is simple, my room had a standing shower with a glass door. The pool was simple and on the smaller side. Parking like every other hotel is expensive and you will find better options searching on your phone to park yourself. The complimentary breakfast was solid, they offer waffles,yogurt, juice, prepackaged omlets and breakfast sandwiches that were very good. I have been to Philly many times over the years for Eagles games and stayed at 20+ hotels in the city and Home2 Suites would definitely be in my top 3. I highly recommend it!Dear Matthew,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,Suite hotel in downtown Philadelphia,"Very clean and comfortable rooms. Kitchenette included in the room. All staff was friendly and helpful. Great lobby and an excellent breakfast. Wonderful location, right across from the Philadelphia convention center and Reading Market. The Southeast Pennsylvania Regional Transit Association rail terminal and train to the airport is next to the Reading Terminal. Easy walk to Independence Mall. Lots of shopping and eating nearby."
"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",3,Breakfast was a disaster,"I wish I could separate the room experience from the breakfast experience but I can't because having breakfast included was a huge part of why we chose this hotel. Not enough seating, not enough staff, and most importantly not enough food. Today is our third breakfast here and they have run out of food each day. Today they are out of milk and waiting for a delivery. We bought milk from the hotel store to put on cereal and then realized it was expired. Guests are lined up six or 7 deep waiting for the breakfast sandwiches to be replenished. As we sit here now, it has been 30 minutes and there is still no milk. That said, the room itself has been very pleasant. Just don't plan on eating breakfast here."
"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,Wizard World visit,"Excellent customer service and very easy check in process. The rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. The location is great for not only the convention center, but is a quick subway trip or walking distance to most of Philadelphia most famous attractions. And having the Reading Terminal Market directly across the street is a great added bonus. There are several very good dining choices very close by. The added security of having to use your room key to enter the hotel and use the elevator is a great feature. Overall, this was a great hotel stay and recommend using Home2 Suites. We will definitely look forward to staying here again .Dear saturn445,I would like to thank you for choosing the Home2 Suites by Hilton Philadelphia for your recent stay.

"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,Last Minute Reservation,"We finished business outside Philly early and took a chance on a room at Home2. Friendly front desk had 3 of us checked in within minutes. Large, clean, well-appointed suite with comfy bed and enormous bathroom awaited us. Perfect location to walk to eat, shop, catch a train for other points within Philly or direct to airport. My flight was delayed and they provided me with a late check-out no problem. Plan to return with my family! Definite yes for anyone staying in Center City."
"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",5,Clean and vey conveniently located,"This was my first stay at a Home2, and I was very pleased. The staff was excellent, the hotel clean and well-appointed, and breakfast was good and plentiful. The fitness center has sufficient equipment, but at least one machine did not work right and was not taken out of service/repaired during my week-long stay."
"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",4,Good stay,We had a very good stay at this hotel. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good. I had been worried about the breakfast because I had seen some reviews that hated the warm up eggs and breakfast sandwiches but I thought they were just fine and there were a few other good options. The only thing that sucks about the warm up sandwiches is the waste it makes. Itd be nice if the wrappings were recyclable.The only negative thing I would say is that the rooms are showing a need for a deep clean. There is dirt accumulating in the corners and soap scum on the shower shelves. The room in general was clean but definitely showed signs of cleanliness neglect if that makes sense. Location is excellent for two reasons. 1) central to all of the attractions which makes everything super walkable and 2) right across the street from Reading Terminal which was awesome!
"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",4,Remember to ask for housekeeping!,"Nice hotel with an excellent location. Large, modern rooms. Nice facilities and great internet connection. I remove one star because housekeeping service is on request only during the weekends.

"Home2 Suites By Hilton Philadelphia-Convention Center, Pa",4,"A few issues, but overall good","Stayed here twice in the past 2 weeks. Accessible room both times. First the bad - I called the hotel within 45 minutes of checking out - very early morning. I realized I had left my ring on the table next to the bed and asked if they could please check on it immediately. They promised to call me back - they never did. Due to my early checkout and my prompt call, I doubt the cleaning staff had even entered the room. So, I'm very unhappy about the ring - nothing overly expensive, but it did have some sentimental value.Accessible rooms themselves were much more adequate than most - we have a lot of experience in this area, and many accessible rooms are NOT truly accessible. For our second stay we were given a room that was on the top floor and the furthest room from the elevator. In an emergency, we would have never gotten out of that hotel. My husband is in a wheelchair. There is no way we would have made it down 9 flights of stairs, and trying to get 2 children and a manual wheelchair to the elevator was tiring and difficult. WHY don't hotels use a little common sense and realize that accessible rooms on LOWER floors would be more logical We were offered no assistance with luggage either stay.A huge plus for this hotel is that they are one of the very few hotels in Philadelphia that offer 2 Queen beds in a room. However, I was told by the front desk staff that none of the Queen rooms face the street. So, the windows in these rooms basically face other 'inside' rooms and offer very little light. The hotel is fairly new, so the rooms do not have the tired and worn appearance that many hotels in Philadelphia do.Location for this hotel is very good. Very close to Jefferson University Hospital, Chinatown, Magee Rehabilitation hospital, restaurants, city hall, etc. Breakfast leaves a lot to be desired, but then again, yogurt, cereal, juice, beats 40+ for a family breakfast at a restaurant each day. I would do away with the microwave items altogether though.Price was very good, location great. While they could have done better in several areas, we plan to stay again."

Didn't have a good experience with housekeeping in my bathroom."
Chelsea Savoy Hotel,3,No frills but convenient location,Recently spent two nights at this hotel. Location is convenient to subway. Short walk to Penn Station. Many restaurants in the area. Not many amenities here. Everything seems well worn but clean. Staff pleasant and helpful. Not inexpensive.
Chelsea Savoy Hotel,5,Great Hotel,"The hotel is situated in the perfect spot for all the attractions, and within walking distance of most of them. The hotel was clean and just right for what we wanted, nothing too flashy, not overly expensive and very clean. We had a great view and could see the top of the Empire State Building from our window. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The Subway was just around the corner and there were plenty of places to eat. Our stay at The Chelsea Savoy hotel was a happy one, we would definitely stay there again."
Central Loop Hotel,5,Good hotel and convenient location,"Stayed here for a short stay in Chicago - easy for travel as it's no more than a five minute walk from Jackson Station on the blue line from the airport.The hotel is conveniently located for downtown locations - some such as Sears Tower are within easy walking distance while others are no more than a short cab ride or a hop on the blue or red line away.While not huge the room we had was clean, tidy and had everything we needed. The staff were friendly and helpful.My only minor moan would be that we made the booking well in advance and the room rate seemed to be a good bit higher than that quoted on-line by the hotel just before we left."
Central Loop Hotel,3,Works for Hamilton!,This is a good place to go if you're just there for a night and you've spent all your money on Hamilton tickets. It's very close to the theater and was the price was nice compared to other hotels nearby. Very kind of them to have water bottles and water stations by the elevators.Dear ifitsnotbaraqueNice to read that we were there to help you enjoy Hamilton. We always have great deals and complimentary amenities leaving more to be spent on enjoying this great cityCome see us again soonKind regardsPAul TiernanHotel Manager
Central Loop Hotel,5,lovely little hotel,Rooms are a bit small but you are in Chicago and don't spend much time in the room. Everything was very clean. Location was excellent. Close to restaurants and attractions. Pillows were wonderful. Fresh water and bottles available on each floor. Coffee and snacks in lounge morning and evening
Central Loop Hotel,4,Good location to conference,"This is a good hotel for business purposes. The wi fi signal is good and it is very close to the federal reserve bank. A little too close to some of Chicago's high crime district for my taste, but we felt relatively safe. Convenient to restaurants, and decent breakfast. A solid business option.Dear Samantha HThank you for your review.I would like to reassure you that The Central Loop area of Chicago which is, as you know, also the Financial District of the City is not near any major crime area. The area is safe and very well patrolled by the Chicago Police so please do not have any concerns.I am glad you had a good stay with us and look forward to you return.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager"
Central Loop Hotel,5,"2nd time around, same great stay, same great service!!!!","Well, they did it again. After a stay at this hotel back in August and the absolutely fabulous service from Erin Loughlin, I kept my promise of never staying anywhere else when I visit Chicago. And, because I love the great city of Chicago, I had to go back. This time, I had no question where my lodging would be as I trekked to and fro across the city streets. I LOVE the personal service. I have told so many people about my great experiences and I hope they choose to patronize this great hotel, too. Like Arnold Schwarzenegger said, I'll be back!"
Central Loop Hotel,4,Central location in City,"The Central Loop Hotel is in the middle of the hustle bustle of downtown Chicago. They offer a lovely sitting room for visitors to enjoy a cup of coffee and visit with other travelors which we found a plus while using Chicago as a central meeting place for an annual get together with my husbands family. The hotel is very clean and the staff excellent, working to make your vist the best it can be. The restaurant in the hotel had good food with great coffee making it a good choice for a convenient breakfast. The rooms are average, but very clean, although we found them a bit stingy with linnens offering just one towel per person. The best part of this hotel is the location making it within walking distance of the museums and shopping. I highly recommend this hotel if you are ok with staying in a busy, central location."
Central Loop Hotel,2,Barebones Hotel,"This hotel is barebones, ugly, and has zero amenities. The people were nice, it was clean, and the location is decent for someone who has business in the Loop. However, there are multiple other hotels right nearby that are much better."
Central Loop Hotel,4,"Perfect for a Solo Traveler - Very clean, nice location!","I went to Chicago last weekend for the Ryder Cup (Golf Tournament) and everywhere I usually stay was completely booked! Rooms were going for crazy rates, so I started seeking out some options that were 'off the beaten path'. I discovered the Central Loop Hotel, and I knew where it was, as I used to walk by it from time to time when I still lived in Chicago.The hotel is very well kept, and has cheap valet (34/night with in-and-out access!). THe check in process was a little strange to me because you check in using a machine like you would at the airport. Some people might love this - but i missed talking to a real person. The machine printed my room info and key card and I headed up to my 6th floor corner room.This room was perfect for my needs. Very comfortable bed, sparkling white linens, beautiful widows that overlooked some fantastic Chicago architecture (post office). But - this room was TINY! Again, it was just me and I knew I would only be spending time in my room sleeping, but the bathroom was very small (no tub, shower only) and the closet was tiny. Almost felt like a ship's quarters. If you are going as a couple, or even attempting to bring kids I would def. upgrade to a larger room or suite. The rooms have free wifi (yeah!), lots of cable channels, free in room coffee and a friendly concierge staff. Free bottled water stations on each floor are also a nice touch.I will stay here again if I'm traveling alone."
Central Loop Hotel,4,Excellent location,"The hotel has an excellent location, close to several tourist attractions such as Millennium Park and The Art Institute of Chicago. The staff is really friendly! We got a check in two hours in advance.Bedroom is clean and has a good size. We asked for an extra bed and it was put in the bedroom quickly. The restroom is also good. Not fancy but comfortable and clean.There's no breakfast included, which is not a good point, but there are several restaurants nearby (Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts and others). The hotel is also close to several train stations.Wifi works well in the bedroom. The fees are not so cheap, but for that location all hotels use to be expensive, so I'd say this one offers a good cost-benefit ratio.In general it was a good experience and I'd stay there again in the future.Dear Camila LThank you very much for the review of your recent stay with us at The Central Loop HotelI am delighted that we were able to offer you good value for money and you were able to enjoy all the amenities that we offer and appreciated our great location from which to get out and see the city.I was especially delighted to read about the service we offered you - we know that these small things make all the difference. We hope we can look after you again very soon.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager"
Central Loop Hotel,4,"Good and practical, great rates","I found this trip on this site and I'm glad I did, it was a great choice. The rooms are smallish but comfortable, and since the trip was a Conference, I wasn't going to be here much anyway.Complimentary wireless access makes this an even better deal. The restaurant is OK but not great (room service through them was very unfriendly), but they have a Starbucks next door for breakfast as well. Conveniently located."
Central Loop Hotel,5,Comfortable and affordable,"I had a room on the 9th floor. Supposed to be a small room but in reality was very adequate with a king size bed. Comfortable, and total paid on booking.com was 88! I was walking distance to the Southshore train which I used to travel from Michigan City, Indiana. I arrived early, 10:45am, and I had planned to ask them to just hold my overnight bag, but they said my room was ready so I was checked in by 11 am! Wow! Every staff member was very helpful, and I enjoyed dinner at the Elephant and Castle restaurant affiliated with the hotel. Excellent food and beverage."
Central Loop Hotel,3,Good central location - dated furniture though,"Overall I enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The staff were very courteous and helpful at all times. I had to ask to be moved after my first night - my original room smelled very musty - I thought it was cigarette smoke even though it was a non-smoking hotel. They promptly moved me the following day to a much nicer room on the 10th floor. I must say though, I thought it was a bit inappropriate that, on the morning when I was moved, one male member of staff (at least I thought) was very condescending to another staff member in front of me - insisting several times that she call housekeeping to clean my previous room straight away (he could've waited until I wasn't standing there) as she had her hands full trying to move me to a different room. Aside from that though - all of the other members of staff were first class. The furniture was a bit dated as well, however for a budget(ish) hotel, it was more than adequate. Good water pressure too in the shower."
Central Loop Hotel,5,"Good experience, great location!","The Central Loop Hotel was in a super convenient location for walking to the Art Institute, restaurants, and shopping on State Street. I arrived by train, and it was just a couple of blocks walk to the hotel. The manager and front desk staff were very helpful and nice. The room was pretty basic, but clean and neat. Felt safe and secure. The only downside was the hotel practice of placing a deposit on my credit card for any incidental charges. I really don't like that practice. I noticed that I was not the only one, another hotel guest was complaining about it at the front counter while I was there. My hotel charges were paid in advance as a birthday gift from a family member, so I thought I was all taken care of, and then found out that I had to give them my credit card just in case there were any charges in addition. Of course there weren't any additional charges when I checked out. I just don't like having to do something like this."
Central Loop Hotel,4,Worth the visit,This hotel is close to the Willis tower and millennium park. If your happy to walk navy pier is about 30 mins away. This hotel is on Adams street which is also the start of route 66. The hotel itself is clean comfortable and the staff are friendly. The room was cleaned daily and extra pillows were provided on request. There is free washing and ironing facilities along with chilled water and ice machines located on each floor. Our room had a fridge and microwave and basic kitchen supplies. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.Dear Louise RIt was great to read that you would stay with us again - what better compliment could you offer !Glad that you enjoyed the many complimentary amenities that we offer and the secret is always to ask if you need anything - we are there to look after you and will do anything to make sure your stay is comfortable and enjoyable .Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel MAnager
Central Loop Hotel,5,Best location in town.,"Granted the rooms in this hotel are not enormous but the high standard of service and spotlessly clean rooms make up for it. The location was perfect and the huge lounge area filled with computers that actually work was a great access. The front desk staff were charming living up to the reputation of customer service. The other great asset was the fact there was door located between the hotel and the restaurant next door. It rained one night during our stay so we were happy to take advantage of the restaurant which incidentally became our choice of breakfast venue as well.Dear JulieThank you so much for so many kind comments and observations.I am delighted that you had such an enjoyable stay with us and were well looked after. I am glad that you also enjoyed the Elephant Castle restaurant, it offers great value for money, service and very convenient opening hours - especially for the night owls. Come see us again soon.RegardsPAul TiernanHotel Manager"
Central Loop Hotel,4,Great Location and Fantastic Value,"The price was right and the location can't be beat. The hotel lobby and room were spotless and the staff could not have been more helpful. The gym was also very clean and the equipment was state of the art. Will definitely become a repeat customer at this hotel. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the sink leaked onto the floor creating a very minor nuisance. Highly recommended, though!"
Central Loop Hotel,4,UK perspective.,As a visitor from the UK I was given all the help possible to enable me to get around the city in the short time that I had available. The rooms were all that I could have wished for. I arrived before check in time but that was no problemDear jameswZ268okbI am glad that we were there to help you enjoy this great city.

Central Loop Hotel,5,Wonderful birthday weekend,"I headed to Chicago to celebrate with friends all of our September birthdays and the Central Loop Hotel was amazing. Great location, great service and so comfortable and clean. I would describe it as a New York style room - small but certainly roomy. The beds were amazing, the pillows so soft and fluffy and my entire experience (3 days) was great. The staff was incredibly helpful and found me a room that was ready for an early check-in. I really liked that on each floor at the elevators they had a purified water station and empty, sealed water bottles for the guests use. What a great idea. The attached Elephant Castle was a great spot for a cocktail or breakfast."
Central Loop Hotel,5,"Good location, Safe area, Rooms are clean, comfortable, and appealing. There's cold water to refill your water bottle,","Good location, it's close to museums that I love. Rooms are clean, comfortable, and appealing, moderate size. There's cold water to refill your water bottle. The price is affordable. I felt as if it was a safe area and I had no worries or concerns about the location. I enjoyed the next door restaurant. It's an easy breakfast location.Since I was staying by myself, I would have enjoyed a movie channel to buy from but I never found it.Good coffee for the morning.Dear MarjieThank you for your review and I am so glad that we succeeded in looking after you on many area's. I have passed on your comments to our housekeeping department as we all know that providing a clean room is essential and it is something we all take great pride in.When you are next in Chicago, we would be delighted to look after you again.Kind regardsPaul Tiernan - Hotel Manager"
Central Loop Hotel,5,"Great hotel, great service, great everything.","My boyfriend and I were taking a road trip to Las Vegas (starting in MI), and we planned to stop in Chicago for a night. I found this hotel online and after seeing the location as well as the price, I was sold. When we arrived, the valet personnel were extremely helpful. They gave us a map to where we could self-park if we weren't interested in using valet, which was only about 2 blocks away. While he parked, I had someone assist me with our bags. They were quick and very friendly, telling me all the things we should do during our short stay. When I got to the room, everything was nice and clean, and though previous reviews say that the room is too small, I found that it was just what we needed for a night. The bed was comfortable, there was enough room to put our multiple bags/suitcases. The bathroom was very clean and the shower had a hand-held shower head, which was nice. We were visiting family that evening, so we wanted to bring a dessert to them. We asked (who I believe was) the manager there where the nicest/closest bakery was, and he told us about Magnolias. The desserts were incredible, a very good recommendation. The next morning, we ordered room service for breakfast from the restaurant downstairs because we were too comfy to even get out of bed. The food was brought up very quickly and was not too expensive at all, plus it was delicious. The only downside to the stay was that you have to pay for parking once again if you choose to leave and come back. However, everything else was great. There is a Starbucks right next door as well as several shopping stores within walking distance. The hotel staff that we had the pleasure of interacting with were all very kind and helpful. We will definitely be coming back for our next trip to Chicago."
Royal Resort,4,Average hotel,The hotel was average but the price and location was very good the Hotel was very old like 90is the staff was helpful if u want to go to attend any show at convention centre then u are at right place its also near to strip only waking distance
Royal Resort,4,Great location off strip,"This place is an average hotel. No casino, no room service, no glitz or glam. BUT it has clean rooms, clean pool w/free cabanas, a small nice restaurant, and nice staff. Location is next the Wynn and Encore close by Circus Circus. Across the street from a 24hr Walgreens and Dennys. I wouldnt call it a family place but its not bad for families. Some young and old partiers but not overly loud or obnoxious. If youre looking to go and dont need the pricey amenities then this place is right. It could use some updating but we werent in the room staring at the walls."
Sterling Gardens Hotel,4,Like a 60's post card!,"Well, the grounds are well kept. pool was clean, and this was our third stay. Beds are ok, and the rooms served their purpose. Large tiled floors with some recycled furnishings from a popular strip hotel. It really wasnt a bad room. cheaper here for a week than 1 night on the strip. Bonus.. 8 feet to your room.. vs 1/2 mile on the strip!!! Not bad att all for a refirbished 1950's hotel, not too bad at all. Save your self the resort fees, stay here and eat you way around Vegas!!"
SpringHill Suites Las Vegas Convention Center,5,Dream Team!!!,"I would like to thank Guest Service Manager Rena for making my stay special. I had a very nice talk with her about her career at Marriott. She was quick to let me know how proud she is of her staff. She should be, they are wonderful. From the time I checked in, her entire staff made me feel welcome and very comfortable. Emily in the restaurant suggested a couple of her go to specials, and she was right on. Delicious!! The hotel was in immaculate condition. The rooms are large and very quiet. Sleeping on the road can be difficult. No problem here. I slept like a baby. Thank you again Rena.....I highly recommend this hotel for business travel, and family travel for all occasions.Hi Tom,Thank you so much for your outstanding review! Rena is well respected for her outstanding customer service and I'll be sure she is aware that you mentioned her in your review. I'm very happy that you were able to enjoy our in house restaurant, Palettes, and found the food to be delicious. I will also be sure to let Housekeeping know how happy you were with your room cleanliness and the clean public space.

"The Cartwright Hotel - Union Square, BW Premier Collection",3,1 Extremely bad staff lady-on morn of 28dec shift,"Overall great stay, rooms are small but cozy ... great fire place near bar to sit and drink wine. Staff was good except this one lady (I may go to extent of calling her border line racist), the reason: we were travelling to Lake Tahoe and asked hotel staff that can we leave our extra luggage at our check out and pick it up once we are back, we were told yes we can but on the day we were leaving she told us they will not, we told her that you guys said you can ... so what has changed to that she did not have any answer. It was a very bad experience and significantly delayed our travel to Lake Tahoe while trying to figure out what to do with extra luggage."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Couple weekend trip to Napa,"The best western plus is located 10 minutes away from downtown Napa. It is located on Soscal Avenue that connects you to many of the top Yelp eateries. The hotel itself is what we have come to expect from the Best Western Brand. Clean and comfortable rooms, but nothing extravagant. There is a short swimming pool (8 yards) and a hot tub with jets. The property was quiet and had ample parking. There is a Denny's around the corner and that didnt bother me like other reviewers. The only trace is that you can smell sausage and pancakes from the parking lot. They do offer a free full breakfast with coffee. Overall I would recommend this hotel if you are afraid of the bed and breakfast scene like I am. Thank you for your review and recommendation. Our rewards members receive a free breakfast in the attached Denny's and most of our reviewers rate it above average as a Best Western Breakfast.. We are glad you enjoyed your free breakfast and stay with us and we hope to see you again in the near future."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Great place to stay,Close to the river with shops and restaurants. Uber/taxi over and enjoy yourself for the night. They used to have a great full breakfast included but now it costs 16-bummer. Staff is helpful and polite. You are 10 minutes to downtown Napa.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,1st Trip to Napa,"We arrived around noon and check-in was not until 4 pm and they gave us room immediately. The room was very large and clean with a balcony. All the staff were friendly and helpful. I am a member of the Gold Crown Club for Best Western and I have been very pleased with the hotels and the prices. Nice to have a Denny's on the property also. I would definately stay there again if ever in the area.We are glad we were able to check you in early. We apprieciate you being a Rewards Member! Membership has its perks. As you know early check ins, late check outs and even free room upgrades when available. We have also just started a full free hot breakfast in the newly remodeled Denny's on our property. Hope to see you on your 2nd trip to Napa."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Everything done well.,"This is not a super luxurious hotel with expensive furniture and fancy rooms. But for what it is, a chain with the usual rooms and extras, it is everything one could ask for. We were checked in by a pleasant and helpful clerk. The room was clean and quiet with a microwave oven, refrigerator, a large TV, and free WiFi. We used the laundry and fitness room facilities which were modern and clean. One of us chose the standard breakfast (coffee or tea, two eggs, sausage or bacon, toast or hash browns), offered at the Denny's next door, which was free. The other got 5 toward one of the other breakfasts offered on the menu. Both were satisfactory. We would stay there again.Thank you for your review and we will see you on your next visit to Napa."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,No whining in the wine country,"Ill be back! Clean and comfortable, with staff that will go above and beyond to make your stay wonderful. We came here for the Napa to Sanoma Half Marathon, and we are quite pleased with our choice. We knew we would not be in the room much, so price was what we were looking for. The Napa Valley is not cheep! But I felt the prices here were reasonable. The convenience of the shuttle to the start of the race was also a selling point for us. We saw many people driving here that morning parking across street to get here in time for the shuttle. AND! right across the street was a nice shopping center with many shops and fast food. Well done Best Western... Well done!Thank you so much for your review. We are really pleased you enjoyed your stay and hope you come visit us again."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,2,Motel turned hotel,"Walked in to the room and was greeted by an overpowering stench of disinfectant. We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future. We have always been a Best Western and have just gone through a 100 remodel of our property I hope that you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,3,Napa wine tastings,"Spent 3 nights at the BW Pluss Inn at the Vines, located just outside of downtown Napa. Perfect location for what we needed. Recommend using Uber for transportation, so easy and fast. It appeared that there was plenty of parking available in the downtown area, but we preferred to walk and enjoy.TwinCityGrl - Thank you for taking the time to review our property. We are conveniently only 1 mile from Downtown Napa, so a quick cab ride away and you're in the heart of everything. We hope you come and see us again soon."

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,great place to stay in the wine country,"Spotless room, comfortable bed, free wi fi, caring and efficient staff. Well located, near the downtown area, close to main highways and wineries. Plenty of parking, elevator to 2nd and third floors, Coffee and tea in room, Denny's restaurant next door.Stan, We are glad you had a great stay.

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,SUPER,"This is the quietest, nice friendly hotel I've been in for years. Service is second to none. Clean, clean, clean.

Will go back for sure, price is decent considering the area.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay. We are here to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. We will see you the next time your in the area."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Good for a night,"We just stayed here one night on a birthday trip to Napa. My friend picked this place to stay and for the it was nice. A little more upgraded than most Best Westerns. Bed was comfy, sink area a little small but not a deal breaker. Had microwave and iron in room which I appreciate.They do give you a discount coupon for the attached Denny's Restaurant. Skip if you can, not really worth it.Next time I would stay closer to Napa itself but for a night, this place was just fine.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Napa,"We stayed at the Best Western Plus during our long weekend trip to Napa. It was perfectly fine for what we needed, a place to sleep after touring wineries! The room was very clean. We were on the second floor by the pool (not sure if all rooms face the pool) and it was good. Only had one instance where a group of loud girls were in the pool area and it was definitely loud in our room, but thankfully it didn't last long. Overall a quiet place. Got vouchers for Denny's next door, easy and fast breakfast before our days. I saw some reviews mentioning traffic due to the location, but it was always an easy in/out for us. Would definitely stay again if in the area, since it's a great place to rest after a busy day!"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Electrical Contractor,"The Best Western Inn at the Vines is conveniently located to the main entrance of the Napa Valley right near across the street walking distance to multiple places for shopping, entertainment, gas and dining. I had an easy relaxing time at this Hotel. The hotel staff were friendly informative and always helpful with my questions. The room was modern, clean and quiet. There was also a restaurant on site with a discount for hotel guests. I really enjoyed my stay and plan to return on my next trip to the Napa Valley.Shawn R - Thank you for your kind review. Our location is very conveniently located close to shopping, restaurants and the downtown area. We are thrilled your stay with us was so satisfying and look forward to seeing you again."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Anniversary,"The room was very clean, large room and had a nice decor. It was centrally located to various wineries, outlett, restaurants and downtown area. Based on our overall experience, we will definitely return to this hotel.It was a pleasure having you as our guest for your anniversary. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and will see you on your next visit."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,3,What You See is What You Get,"The reviews on this Best Western are all over the range of scores, but we all stayed at the same motel. Go figure! This is a basic services motel in an upscale county (Napa). Don't come here expecting frills and fancy decor. And what's wrong with eating breakfast at Dennys We used the coupons and our breakfast cost about 2 plus tip. If you are here to tour the wine country there are probably better places to stay. If you are just looking for a place in Napa to spend a night or two please give this place your consideration. We arrived here on our way to Sonoma County and needed a place to stay for 1 night. The Best Western suited our needs. Our room was clean and the furniture was in good shape. I can't speak to the ammenities since we just used the Best Western as a place to sleep, clean up and hit the road."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Scenic drive up to Calistoga,Our stay was perfect. The room was immaculate and location was great.The people at the front desk were so accommodating and helpful.We arrived early and they got us a room before check in time.They gave helpful restaurant choices as well!!Hey Dianne! We are happy you enjoyed your stay! Please come back and see us again! Cheers!
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Would Return,"This Hotel was much better than expected after reading some of the negative reviews here. I was incredibly pleased with the room, the staff, and the location. The room was fairly modern with 2 perfect double beds. The bathroom and shower were perfect. The Hotel is a 5 minute drive to downtown Napa and about 10-15 minutes to the Silverado Trail. The hotel provided breakfast coupons to Denny's which is directly next door and was perfect for us - I had a healthy egg-white and fruit breakfast while my travel companions gorged themselves on Denny's Grand Slam. I would definitely return here for its cleanliness, staff, and proximity to everywhere I wanted to be.I am glad we surpassed your expectations. We pride ourselves on our clean well appointed rooms and our customer service. Thanks for the review and we will see you on your next visit."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Great nights sleep,"We stay at this hotel several times during the year while visiting family. Always have a peaceful and comfortable sleep. The bed is very comfortable and the breakfast items are a nice touch for a quick grab and go if you don't have time to go to the restaurant next door. There are many different restaurants nearby also. Usually the road noise is very minimal. Great choice for travelers, close to everything in the Napa Valley. Shirley A - Thank you for taking the time to write such a kind review. We do our best to make sure everyone's stay is as pleasant as yours was. We look forward to your next visit. Thank you - Genafer, Director of Sales"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,nice napa hotel,"this is an older hotel remodeled very nicely good value for the price especially around napa valley. clean and comfortable rooms good resturaunt attached. very accessable to downtown napa resturaunts and shoppingharoldr1 - Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We are pleased that you enjoyed your stay with us. I'm so glad our hotel meets all your needs and we hope you come back to see us again in the near future. Sincerely, Genafer, Director of Sales"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Comfortable room and pleasant staff,Convenient location on edge of Napa...rooms appeared to be recently renovated and were well appointed. Staff was extremely pleasant. Rates were competitive...free breakfast next door for BW Gold Crowne members.Rainier66 - Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We are pleased you enjoyed your stay and hope to see you again in the future.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Very Solid Choice,"The Best Western Inn at Napa was a very comfortable place to stay. The room was a very decent size and had good amenities. Parking was free and it was in a good location to be able to explore Napa, although admittedly not in the most picturesque part of the valley. A very solid choice if you want a slightly cheaper option and don't mind not staying in a farmhouse!Thank you for your review. We are glad you enjoyed your stay."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Good choice for those on a budget,"This hotel is not within walking distance of the downtown Napa restuarants and shops, but it is within walking distance of several chain restuarants, stores and a movie theater. It served us well since we had a car and spent most of the day exploring the vineyards. They offer cereal bars, juice and coffee in the morning and you receive a discount at the Dennys next door. We would stay here again, mainly because of the cost benefit.Gregory K - Thank you for the great review. We are thrilled you enjoyed your stay and please come see us again soon!"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Great hotel and staff - recommend,"I came in late after a long drive from Vegas ending in a whole lot of highway exits and concentration to get to Napa! I was greeted by a friendly night staff who was expecting me, and (not sure of his name) made me feel more relaxed immediately. I even got a little welcome pack with a snack and water. That was much appreciated!Breakfast was not included, fruit and granola bars were out in the lobby. A hotel discount was offered at the friendly Denny's next door. My room was quiet and all 3 of the morning staff were incredibly helpful the next morning helping me map out my day of driving, and helping me choose and book my next hotels. The hotel is a convienent location, not too far off the main highway. Near all services and malls if needed.We are glad you enjoyed your stay with us and look foward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley!"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Always a great stay!,"Inn at the Vines is always a great stay in Napa Vallley. Good rooms and nice, friendly employees make this a wonderful stay. Great price/value! We dont use the free breakfast at Dennys but still nice that is included. Good location for visiting wine country."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Loved this property,"I love the Best Western Plus product. The rooms are always big and clean.This is my first visit to Napa, the area is beautiful. I picked this locating using my airline discount site which posted good reviews as well.The staff are very friendly and accommodating. We received a 3rd floor room above the lobby which afforded us a great view. Even though our balcony overlooked the road, we never heard any traffic noises. There is plenty of shopping and food options right across the street.We drove to downtown Napa and found plenty of great option for shopping and dining as well. I recommend going down there for good local flavor. I would discourage using your phone as your GPS to get around to various vineyards, we had two different maps going but kept losing our signal. Either bring your Garmen, etc. or ask the rental car agency for one just in case.Thank you for your detailed review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Week-end Napa Trip,"We were looking for a Saturday night stay. Most hotels require a 2-night minimum. Inn at the Vines would book a one night for a Queen bed, which was fine with us. AAA discount was 186. If you have a BW member then you get a free breakfast at Denny's which is next door. Hotel was refurbished about 1-year ago, so everything was clean and fresh. Only issue is the in-wall air conditioning units are too loud to run while sleeping.Great location and convenient to freeways.Thank you for your review! I am sorry about the noisey a/c unit and will have it checked out. Almost all units have been replaced and maybe we missed one somehow. Your sleep and comfort is our main goal and with a little fun on the side. Come back and let us show why we are BEST WESTERN!"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Napa Valley Jazz Getaway Stay,"We've stayed at this hotel for the last 4 years to attend the Napa Valley Jazz Getaway. Always a good experience. Great stay, attentive staff and nice treat to have free breakfast at Denny's! Will stay there again."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Staff was superb!,"Great staff at this hotel. It's in a nice location too. The hotel is dated, but I very much enjoyed the breakfast at Denny's (ask for Ceci) as Best Western will give rewards members a free breakfast or 6.00 off another breakfast entree at Denneys. Bertha was fantastic as check in. She accommodated my special requests and took me to 3 rooms to let me decide as I told her I was super picky. Pierre and Michael and Darby were also super kind and helpful. Michael is very knowledgeable about wineries. Darby helped me with restaurants, and Pierre was also helpful and offered any additional assistance he could. Pierre had coffee made SUPER early which is great as I was up at 4 or 4:30 each day. It was nice he was there to greet me and there was decaf and coffee made early. They need to update the rooms, but the business center was nice with 2 computers and the exercise room and laundry facility was all right there too--super convenient. The price was high, but I guess all the prices are high at Napa. I'd recommend the location too. Thanks!"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,This was surprisingly luxurious for the price.,"I have a different opinion of Best Westerns after staying at this hotel. Very, very nice accommodations for the price. I would definitely go back again!We are glad we surprised you! Our newest surprises in store are a workout room, business center and guest laundry. We should have them up and running by your next visit to Napa. ps: sorry to ruin the surprise!"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Nice surprise,"We were a group of three couples in our fifties who were on a 10 day wine trip in Northern California. We spent three nights at the Best Western Inn at the Vines. It was clean, breakfast was convenient and the location was fine.The best part of the stay was the help we received from the front desk by Bridget. She was more than willing to answer questions, make suggestions for things to do, places to visit, and she offered restaurants choices."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Wow-Great price for a great room in a very over-priced tourist area,"Very nice motel on busy intersection, but rooms are located toward back of property so noise not too bad. Interior corridor access restricted w/card lock opened w/room key so w/level of additional security for single woman. Has elevator to 2nd and 3rd floors. Room spotless, clean, everything in great condition. Newfangled heat/AC controls w/instructions (thank goodness!) worked well. Shower w/shower massage-very nice touch. Was very comfortable stay. Would definitely stay again."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Clean and good location.,"The room was very clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Great location, many vineyards are just 10-15min away (ask for vouchers for wine tasting at the reception). The hotel and the rooms are very basic but perfect for a short stay in Napa. Great value for the price you pay. I would defintely come back.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay. We will see you again the next time in the area."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,A do again for sure!,My husband and I made our first trip to Napa recently and stayed at the Inn at the Vines hotel. We were greeted with a smile and the staff was very friendly. Genafer asked if this was our first visit to Napa and offered to gave us a few places they suggest we visit during our stay. Our room was quite and cozy and the beds were super comfortable for a hotel! Genafer and the other woman in the office were both very friendly and I plan on staying there again when I go back in October!Rhonda S - Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a nice review and we look forward to you and your husbands visit in October. Make sure to ask for me when you arrive and I will make sure to have more suggestions for you.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,1,What a Ripoff,"Charged me for the night that didn't stay. I booked through Booking.com and kept telling me to contact Booking.com and they didn't take any responsibility. There are no confirmation emails or calls for my booking. 0 customer service.Myat Thu L - After reviewing your reservations. I show 2 rooms that were booked for arrival of 12/06/15 through a third party website. You should have received confirmation for these bookings through the third party you booked them through. Unfortunately, nobody showed up for arrival on 12/06, and the reservations were charged first night room and tax for a no show."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Very nice,"Comfortable beds, nice pool and hot tub. Computer room very handy since I didn't bring a laptop or iphone. Good fitness center. Great bonus was a coupon for a free full breakfast at next door's Denny's.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay!"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Nice hotel Napa,"Gorgeous sheets and comfy beds, flat screen TV. The room was nice and quiet. Great location to visit key areas of Napa and very close to downtown . Staff was very friendly. The only thing we missed was a safe in our room. Reasonable prices for July.Thank you for your review. I am glad you enjoyed your stay. Come back and see us again."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Amazing experience,"Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines is located perfectly in Napa Valley. Short distance to shops, downtown nightlife, and my favorite winery. They offered breakfast at Denny's which is a short walk from the hotel. The hotel landscape is eye catching, sort of romantic every time you drive into the parking lot. The amenities they offer are very nice, excellent fitness room, wiifi, and pool area.traveler2016now - Wow, thank you for taking the time to write such a glowing review, it sounds like you had a memorable visit to Napa and this makes me smile! We hope to offer you a stellar time next time you are in town."

Overall I'd give this hotel a 100 and I'd definitely come again!Ronda S,We are so glad you enjoyed your stay with us. Come back soon !"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Great location at a reasonable price.,"This motel is in an excellent location at a reasonable price for the area. The room was very clean and had a refrigerator and microwave. It is about a five minute drive from the downtown area. If you are a Best Western Rewards member, the room charge includes a breakfast at Denny's, which is located on the same property. It is not the regular breakfast menu however, it has a variety of selections and we were happy with the amount of food provided.cinann - Thank you for taking the time to write this review. Our entire staff takes pride in our hotel and it shows inside and out. Our prices are very reasonable for the Napa Valley. Being just a few minutes from Downtown Napa and wineries in the area, you just can't beat that. Thank you for being a Best Western Rewards Member and we hope you visit us again soon. Genafer, Director of Sales"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Great customer service and good value for the location,"We stayed here for 3 nights in September. We arrived early and in a bit of a rush to get ready for a wedding. The hotel staff was very helpful in getting our room ready early for us. It's always nice when a hotel goes a little extra to help out, great customer service! We stayed in a standard king size room, which was spacious with a couch/sitting area.The room was quiet, we never really heard any noise from outside or from neighbors. There isn't a breakfast option, but there is a Denny's attached to the hotel and they give you 6 off per person coupons to use each day.We went to wineries in St. Helena and Oakville, the travel times varied between 20-30 mins. We ate dinner in Napa and it was just a few minutes drive to plenty of places. Overall, based on the location, price and customer service, I would recommend this hotel.Jdiddy78 - Thank you for such a kind review. We strive on incredible customer service and do everything we can to make sure you are satisfied with your stay. I'm glad we could get you into your room early to get ready for the wedding you were attending and we hope next time you're in our area you will come and stay with us again.

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Best Western at the Vines,"Great hotel! If you are going on the Winetrain in Napa, it is conveniently located 5 - 6 minutes away and is a very safe, clean and comfortable place to stay. Only problem we had was the shower water temperature was difficult to set and maintain! Hopefully they may be able to fix this minor problem!"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Great place to stop,"Great central location for exploring downtown Napa and the Napa Valley. Good access from HWY 29, HWY 12, and HWY 128. There are plenty of much more expensive choices in the Napa area, but saving a few on lodging allows for stretching for great local food and wine.Thank you for your review and I am glad we were a great place to stop on your visit to the Napa Valley. We aim to be the best value for your in Napa. Hope to see you again in the near future."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Great location,"Perfect location to begin your exploration of Napa wine country.

We are so thrilled you enjoyed your stay and we can't wait to see you again. Genafer, Director of Sales"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Great value and location,"My first time staying at a Best Western Plus and I was pleasantly surprised. The employees here are great and genuinely nice people always willing to assist. The rooms were clean and well kept and nicely appointed. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms spacious and clean. It was also very convenient to have a Denny's restaurant within the hotel. The location of this hotel is also very good and on a main road with many shops and dining options. This place is good for an affordable family trip without sacrificing on quality.Jorge,Thank you for the great review. We are always looking at being very competitively price and to give our guest the best accommodations for the price in Napa. We will see you on your next trip to Napa."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,"Clean, convenient","The location was perfect -- easy to find and suited our needs for our activities while in town. Check-in was easy, people were nice, the room was clean. It's not fancy, but given the alternatives in Napa (very pricey), it suited our needs. (We had two rooms, and our relatives had a third.) There's no getting around that this is a Best Western, with Denny's as the anchor restaurant. Clean, no frills, convenient. No more, no less.Annhurst - I am pleased to hear that our hotel suited all your needs. We are thrilled you got everything you needed in your visit to Napa. Come visit us again soon."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,2,Not worth the price,"I paid over 190. The pictures looked nice but they were deceptive. The outside looks like a Motel 6. The rooms were nice on the inside with modern decor but the staff was extremely rude. I travel a lot, domestically and internationally. This was a very unique experience in the way I was treated upon arrival. I would not recommend this hotel. I should have either stayed at a bargain hotel or went for it and spent the 400 to stay at a nice place downtown.Melissa R - Please let me start by apologizing to you for your disappointing stay. Our practice is to make sure all our guests feel warm welcome. I would very much like to speak with you, so that I may get more details regarding your experience. I can be reached directly at 707-257-1930. ext 150. Thank you, Genafer Vattuone"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Kindness during the fires,My 93 year old mother and caregiver were evacuated due to the fires. This Best Western made every accommodation to make them welcome and comfortable. They did NOT jack the rates up knowing there would be hundreds of people looking for a place to stay. They did NOT charge extra for leaving sooner than expected. They behaved as compassionately as possible.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Inn at the Vines,The location of this place was very centrally located to everywhere we wanted to go. We went to Napa to view the wineries and take a bike ride through the vinyards and then to San Francisco and off to Sonoma. Great location.We are so thrilled you had a great time in Napa. Please come see us again.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,"A Quality, Service Minded, Modestly Priced Hotel in Napa!","I coordinated a group of 23 visiting Napa during the grape harvest in October, and we booked the entire group into the Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines. First, let me say if youre a snob and really into posh places with fancy marble lobby floors, fluffy robes on the hook, perky concierge behind a big desk, etc. this may not be for you. But if you like to get real value, service and comfortable accommodations for a modest price, you cannot beat the Inn at the Vines. It is family owned and operated (several generations), and the service and sense of community are notable in this day and age. The place has been updated and has all the features you need..clean well furnished rooms, flat screens, very comfortable beds (we had king bed rooms), great towels, and organic soaps. To some earlier reviews about highway noise: we found it minimal and no one in our group complained. Yes, I did hear the occasional truck early in the morning or California kid with a Flowmaster exhaust doing a jack-rabbit start from the intersectionagain it was not a problem. Ask for a room in the back of the hotel. Front Desk Manager Shanirra did an exceptional job booking our customized winery tour, restaurant reservations, and balloon rides. As our person on the ground in Napa she was in our corner every step of the way and played a large part of a successful three days in Napa! At the front desk Melody, Shawn and Bertha were always helpful, upbeat and service-minded. Complimentary hotel breakfasts are a joke at many hotels.not so at the Inn at the Vines. There is a Dennys on the property, and you get a legitimate complimentary hot breakfast at the restaurant not some dinky room off the lobby. Try eggs any way you want, bacon/sausage and pancakes/toast and coffee. You cant beat it unless you must have Eggs Benedict and mimosas. The owners are continuously making improvements to keep up with newer hotels. During out stay a fitness center and business center were under construction. Botom line: when visiting Napa in the future I will stay at the Inn at the Vines again. Our entire group was pleased.Ed,it was a pleasure meeting you and hosting your group for your stay in the Napa Valley. I enjoyed hearing your story of what happened at the Castle. Yes, Shanirra is a great employee who is always the first to try out new restaurants and tours. All of our employees keep up to date on all there is to do in the Valley. We are family run (4th generation), and as you saw, we take pride in our Hotel. I am glad your group enjoyed their stay and maybe we can make this an annual event."

Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Jewel in Napa Valley,"This hotel on the outskirts of Napa Valley provided an excellent base to tour this area. The staff were excellent and provided us with a lot of local information and recommendations for our specific requests. They provided us with a lot of options for our stay and were so friendly and informative. We would recommend this hotel purely on the standard of the reception staff.Dear 185robynp,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. I'm so pleased you enjoyed our stay and our staff was able to help you with your plans around the valley. We hope to see you again soon. Cheers, Genafer"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Comfortable to Stay in Napa,"VERY clean, comfortable place to stay located near downtown Napa. The grounds are nothing special, but there is a (very) small pool and jacuzzi, as well as a small fitness center. Clean, comfortable and conveniently located. If you plan to mostly be out and about in Napa, stay here. If you plan to spend your time lounging around the pool and grounds, pick someplace else. But you'll probably have to pay more.Thank you for your review and we are glad you enjoyed your stay."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Bewst Western Review,"It is always the staff experience that provides to customers that's why I like staying at Best Western in Napa. They always do an extra mile and never forget to smile, even the housekeeping they are very polite and always with a smile when they greet you.Armandmariano C - Wow, thank you so much for such a kind review. I agree, the staff experience makes all the difference. Our staff here is stellar and I will make sure to share these kind words with all of them. We look forward to your next visit. Thank you again - Genafer, Director of Sales"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,A High Five,"As it was both of our birthdays and anniversary weekend we asked for an upper floor roorm, quiet, away from the street, in the back. All of our requests were granted. We had a 3rd floor room with a balcony in the back over the pool. Also, the housekeeping staff had made swans out of the towels in shape of a heart which was on our bed. This went way above and beyond. Thank you Melody and All of the BW staff for making our stay memorable. We will definetly be back.Thank you for the High Five! Melody is a great asset to our Hotel and we are glad you enjoyed the swans and your stay. Hope to see you again soon!"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,3,Good price and location for Napa,"Overall I rate this hotel as average in some areas, and above in others. First the good: Price considering the Napa Valley location it was a good value, at check in we received our free breakfast coupons for Denny's adjacent to hotel. The location makes it easy to get downtown, or cross the bridge to Hwy 29. Staff at the hotel was very friendly and helpful, its like they get it be friendly to your guests and they will either return or recommend your hotel to others.Average in outside noise is noticeable, doors closing, street noise, people walking in rooms above you, showers in the morning...etc. Hotel is somewhat dated yet clean and pretty well cared for.I would stay here again.Thank you for staying with us. We are always working on upgrading our Hotel. We are in the process of adding a workout room, guest laundry and business center. Customer service is always number one with us and we will see you again on your next visit to the Napa."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Comfortable place to stay in Napa,"Spent a few days in Napa, and found this very clean and comfortable. A little distracted by road noise in the morning, weekdays, and not a huge fan of Denny's, the attached food venue. But really impressed by the cleanliness of the hotel, and friendliness of the staff.Thank you for your review and we hope to see you again."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Nice Location,On a visit to San Francisco my husband and I decided to take a quick over night with friends to Napa and ended up at Inn at the Vines. The hotel is a little older but in pretty good shape. Our room was large and clean enough! The location for us was good. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning.The poor girl checking us in was alone and pretty darn busy. She was great though!! We would certainly recommend the hotel for anyone staying a night or 2 in Napa!!Thank you for your review and compliments on our hotel.Come back and see us again.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,2,Clean but noisy.,"Clean hotel but the noise and vibrations from people walking outside to the bathroom fans in other rooms reverberated right through the bed. very poor insulation. Definitely not worth 140 a night. Napa city is highly over rated. If you are going for wine, then stay in the small towns up the valley like St Helena.Thank you for your review. I am sorry for any noise you encountered during your stay with us. I will look into the fan noise and get it replaced at once."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Great Stay,"When booking in this area we looked at both Sonoma and Napa. Sonoma is generally more expensive so we picked Napa, they are very close. We were glad that we picked Napa, it is a pretty and very manageable town and this hotel was very good. I thought that it might be a bit far out but it is not. Napa is very small and it is only a few minutes to drive to the central area where there are lots of great restaurants and shops. My husband walked it in the mornings. There are much pricier hotels than this one further out from the town centre.The room that we had was freshly reno'd and was large, clean and had a comfortable bed with nice linens. The only thing that we found a bit strange is what they call a balcony... it is an enclosure with a hole cut in it. We had a room looking out over the pool, but you can't see anything sitting on the balcony.The staff were very helpful and gave us great advice and suggestions each morning before we set out. The breakfast is at Denny's so you can get a big breakfast or get a something smaller and take the 5 credit.The pool and hot tub were small but nice at the end of the day. Would recommend this hotel.We are glad you had a Great Stay. Come back and stay with us on your next visit to Napa."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Great place,The maids were very helpful room was excellent! Melinda at the front desk was terrific too! As I had stated I needed to check in earlier than 4pm mu room wasn't ready I had to wait an hour and a half.
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,2,Overpriced No frills,"This place was a dud..Swimming pool was more like a bath tub... The view from the balcony was of a traffic light....Location is not bad, but not next door to vineyards...Worthy of no more than 75-90.Thank you for your review. We are always trying to lead in the best value in the Napa Valley. During the Harvest Season the demand is very high and we are inline with our competition and our average rate is one of the lowest in the valley. Tip: Best hotel rates are between November 11th and April 30th."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Very helpful staff. Superb value for very fair price.,"Good location convenient to drives through the vineyard districts and excellent downtown restaurants. Relatively new, well maintained hotel with large, bright, attactive, spotless, comfortable rooms. We must praise the staff and are greatful for their good natured, spot-on advice. Shawn was on duty when we arrived. She gave us great advice for drives and restaurants (loved Ristorante Allegria) and she even went online to compile a list kid-friendly vineyards. We should also mention Shanirra who was on duty in the daytime. The breakfast included in the price of the room is served in the adjacent Denny's. Food was standard but service was a bit slow. To be fair, it was a very busy weekend. I do not hesitate to recommend this hotel to our friends and we will certainly stay there again. By the way, I think you can help hotels save money (and maybe get you a better price) by calling them direct rather than useing third party resellers. (like Priceline, Travelocity etc.)Thank you for your review. We strive to give the best customer service possible to make everyones experience enjoyable. Shawn and Shanirra are a great value to our staff and I am pleased they had the advise and information you needed. You are right either book direct or at Bestwestern.com for the best price. We will see you again the next time your in the area."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Great price and location. Close to everything in Napa!,"We spent four days at this hotel and it was a good experience. We wanted to visit Napa Valley but many on the inns and hotels are very expensive. We certainly were not planning to spend much time at the hotel and just wanted something comfortable and convenient. It is located a 5 minute drive from downtown Napa and 10 minutes away from the Wine Train Station. There are many things nearby if you need stuff. There is a Dennys next to the hotel and a Target, Applebees, IHOP and many more fast food restaurants just across the road. Since we were traveling with kids it was good to have different options. The hotel is very basic but well-kept. The rooms are big and comfortable and so is the bathroom. There is a tiny pool and hot tub outside. The kids liked that. We enjoyed our experience there.We are very happy that you, our world travlers from China, enjoyed your stay with us. If you ever get back to Napa we look foward to being your home away from home again."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Quiet and near what we needed,"This hotel had great staff. They promptly got us checked in, helped us with information on Napa Valley wineries. The room and bathroom were exceptionally clean. Bed was very comfortable. Free internet met our needs. Hotel breakfast was vouchers for the Denny's on hotel property. That was nice to have a full breakfast. Property was clean. Our room was quiet (202) with minimal noise from hallway or street. We were able to get good nights rests. Love the microwave and empty frig in the room. Room rate was high due to us being there during an event that this hotel was associated with. So the limited supply and high demand rates were in effect.Katrina,We are glad you enjoyed your stay and it is always good to hear that my staff gave exceptional service. Hope to see you again on your next visit to Napa."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Best Western Plus Inn at the Vines - Comfortable Stay,"Hotels can be pricey in Napa especially at peak times. I was coming to BottleRock, America 's newest music festival and didn't want to drive home nightly. I booked this motel right away because I knew there would be a big demand for local accommodations. The Best Western is located at the edge of town. It is a healthy walk to town. For BottleRock a shuttle picked up guests right out front and carried them back after the show. The hotel rooms are clean and spacious with the amenities you would need, including a small refrigerator and microwave. The hotel has a pool and a Denny's is hooked to the building. The hotel gave out a coupon for breakfast at Denny's. The desk staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. This is a decent place to stay. Prices fluctuate so you have to check aroundThank you for your review and hope to see you before next years Bottle Rock!"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,2,If this is a Plus property....yikes!,"I wish tripadvisor had 1/2 stars for our use because I would have given this a 2 1/2...3 is too high. This was our first hotel of 8 different ones on our Napa/Pacific Coast vacation, so I have a lot to compare it to. I have many other reviews on this site and I try to be fair when reviewing any property we've sayed at.Having said that.....It was my first experience at a Best Western brand and if this is a plus property I would not want to stay at a non-plus one.I disagree with the person responding to all of the other reviews...this is not a good value or comparable value to other hotels in the area. Who are you comparing yourself with When comparing properties you need to look at the amenities of hotels in your price range. You are priced as high as other properties but those properties have better/more amenities or are closer to vineyards, therefore it's not a fair comparison. It's like comparing apples and oranges...both fruits but there are many different qualities. Now back to the property....Don't expect to see any vines even though the word is in the name. This is located on a very busy road surrounded by stores and restaurants. If that's what you're looking for, great book it, just be aware that there will be a lot of traffic noise and light polution.Cons....The pool's capacity is 8 people. That should tell you something about the size. I'd guess it's 8X10' (that's probably a generous estimate). In my opinion putting in a couple of extra hottubs instead of the tiny pool would have been more beneficial. The balcony we had was so closed in and dark. The solid front and sides don't allow you to see anything when sitting in the chairs, not that the view was great....we looked out over Denny's roof and a traffic light. Oh, Dennys. sigh.....went our first 2 mornings. Ordered the free entree of 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and 2 bacon or sausage. Getting a hot entree I guess is impossible, the food was cold to the touch. My husband faced the kitchen and saw the breakfasts sitting up on the counter for a long period of time before the waitress bothered to serve it. There were maybe 4 other parties in the restaurant at the time, not busy at all. The tea water was luke warm at best. Total waste of my time.Location...not your romantic getaway place by any means. About 20 to 25 minutes to the heart of Napa's wine country depending on traffic. In hinesight I would not have booked this hotel if not for the MANY( now suspicious in my mind)...reviews. I find it hard to believe that this many people think this hotel is the best. Really After spending 3 days in Napa and seeing many other hotels closer to the wineries, I question the validity of these raving reviews.Pros....Yes there are a few...I promised a fair review and that's what I deliver.Shower....best shower head of any hotel. In fact I'm looking for one for my own shower.Cleanliness....our room was very clean. Small in size in comparison to other hotels on our trip and just an armoire instead of a closet. Microwave, fridge and coffee pot was a nice convenience.Bed/pillows....very comfortable.So if you're looking for a clean place to sleep that's a bit overpriced than book this hotel. If you want to see vineyards from your balcony and sit by a nice pool...don't book this property. At most I would expect to pay under 100 a night for this property based on it's location and lack of amenities. All the renovations in the world don't matter to me if they're not available when I'm there. They need to charge accordingly.We paid 537 for Saturday, Sunday and Monday evenings. I now know we could have spent the same money and stayed at a better property. Oh well, live and learn.Thank you for your detailed review. First, we do compare our hotel to our competition by actually going to all the hotels in our class and looking at their rooms and overall condition of their property. Each hotel will have their pluses and minuses. We also shop prices on a daily basis and we make sure we are competitive in our market. We actually have all the prices of the hotels on the days you stayed and only one hotel was less than our price and its located 9 miles south of Napa, further away from the vineyards. On average you would have paid between 75 -200 more for your stay in a comparable hotel.All Best Westerns that have at least a 3 diamond recognition from AAA have the opportunity to be a PLUS property as long as they have a PIP( property Improvement Plan) in place. With the cost that runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars it will take time for each property to complete. There is a time frame on completing this and we are well ahead of the deadlines. Our rates are similar to last years (before Plus) and we have added breakfast at Dennys and many more amenities. We never hide the fact that we have a small pool (12x 184). There are pool area pictures displayed on our website and other 3rd party sites. When a guest inquires about the pool we let them know that we have a small pool. We recommend other hotels if a guest are looking for a larger pool.As for reviews, all reviews are honest and we know that there will be a difference of opinions and as you can see we are rated in the middle of the hotels in Napa. We are a family run hotel and take pride in our hotel and are always looking at ways to improve. TripAdvisor is way too smart to let suspicious reviews slip through as it is their reputation and ours.Thank you for your compliments on the cleanliness of our rooms, (we are an ultra clean property) our shower heads and beds. The shower heads are by Delta and Ive actually seen them at Home Depot. The bed that was in your room is a Cheshire IV pillow top by Serta. Thank you again for your review."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,Repeat customer with family in Napa.,"Great location for us with family. There is a really nice exercise room, laundry, pool and business office. Coffee and tea are in the room with a fridge. The staff are friendly. The rooms are clean and comfortable with a prepared breakfast which I prefer rather than the carb load at some Best Westerns."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,2,It's Okay,"The good points: it's relatively inexpesive, it was clean, and the service was good. The bad: it's close to a heavily used road (think noise), and its not quaint or luxurious. The brochure claims that you get a complimentary Breakfast. But what they actually give you is 2.50 off your breakfast at Dennys. This basically covered the cost of our coffee. I don't think Dennys has a breakfast on the menu for 2.50."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,NAPA Visit,"This was a nice Best Western. We were allowed to check in early. The free breakfast was the best of any hotel I have ever visited because we could choose items of the Denny's menu. There was ample parking with shopping and dining across the streetdavidsI8109CM - Thank you for the 5 Star review. It makes us so happy to that our guests have such a pleasant stay with us. We hope to see you again soon! - Cheers, Genafer"
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,5,Great place to stay,"We recently spent two nights at the Inn of the Vines Best Western Plus. The rooms were spacious, clean, and well appointed. The staff was extremely helpful and welcoming. We had reservations for the Wine Train and the hotel location was ideal- only about 1 1/2 miles away."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,4,BW - Napa,"This hotel is a reasonably good place to stay if you want to visit the Napa Valley. Our room was clean and pleasant, the staff members we encountered were helpful and professional, and the price we paid for our room (during December of 2014) was reasonable. However, potential guests should be aware that, according to information we were given by a staff member, rates may be different during the summer.Thank you for your review. I am glad you enjoyed your stay and the service we provided. Yes the summer rates are higher, but we are still one of the most reasonably price hotels during that time of year. Hope to see you again."
Best Western Plus Inn At The Vines,2,Not worth the money,"The room was so noisy we could hear every footstep from the people above, every toilet flush and every shower that they took. Winetasting in the courtyard was very loud and folks stayed after the winetasting drinking until the wee hours of the night . Staff was not willing to quiet them nor even leave the front desk to talk to them. Breakfast items in the morning were not replenished hot water was out replaced with warm water not useful at all . Rumors of free vouchers to Dennys never appeared .This was not a cheap property I do not feel I got my moneys worth I couldve stayed at a motel eight or six for equivalent valueOn behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future."
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,3,Good hotel front desk could improve,"We stayed here before a Saints game with kids. Pros: Location was perfect for this - room was clean and large and the kids loved the games in the bar. The bar staff was particularly helpful and friendly. Cons: the front desk is understaffed and really slow, both check-in and check-out. The breakfast area ran out of almost all items and closed early. The hotel screwed up our pre-arranged late checkout and locked us out, and then gave us the wrong key TWICE. Long story, but the whole mix up ended up costing us 45+ minutes.Well that's certainly not the experience we hope to provide. We will be sure to share your feedback with our front office to ensure this is not an ongoing issue. We do hope you give us another shot next season! WHODAT!!Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Aloft Nola,"We had a wonderful time. Aloft was beautiful. The staff helpful and friendly. The room was spacious and the amenities were very good. The beds were very comfortable. The location was really good for getting around the city.Doesn't get much better than that! Thank you for your kind words and we look forward to your next visit, Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Wonderful!,"We always enjoy staying at Aloft locations. They are unique, clean, and our teenagers love them! The hotel staff are always helpful and friendly. The downside is that you have to walk a bit to get to the tourist areas, but it is located downtown.Thanks so much for your loyalty to the Aloft Brand. See you again soon, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,Good time in NOLA. Check your bill before you leave!,"The lobby was small, but modern. The valet and check in staff were great. We had a package that included breakfast. We ordered and put both orders on one slip (Why waste paper), but the hotel charged us for one breakfast because they were not written on TWO separate tickets. The food was not so great. Pre-cooked and microwaved. Not worth the money. The room was great, but we had a corner room. The waterpressure could have been better. Overall, not too bad. Not my first choice for a NOLA hotel, but would consider it again if I had to.Glad you had a great time overall here with us at Aloft NOLA. We appreciate your feedback and are always looking for ways to improve. Like most Aloft's, our breakfast options are grab and go items aimed at quick and convenient service. On a brighter note, those corner rooms are great and offer fantastic views on the Crescent City. We appreciate your business and look forward to having you back here with us again soon.Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,3,Small room with NO window,"This was the first hotel we have ever stayed at that felt like you were sleeping inside of a walk-in closet the room had no window at all and was very claustrophobic we stayed in room 1701 and apparently from speaking to the front desk over 1/3 of the hotels rooms or exactly like this king room I feel that the hotel should forewarn you of these fax however they do not the staff was very friendly and accommodating the room was just not up to par like other Aloft hotels we have stayed at We do have 21 King rooms in the hotel that do not have a window and while they will run you the same price as our traditional kings, there is an option to choose this room. Be sure to check your confirmation when booking to ensure you've selected the correct room. We are thrilled to hear the staff was accommodating and we will be sure the front desk is confirming room types at check in.Thanks for your business, we hope you'll be back,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Super Christmas vacation,"Last minute trip to enjoy Christmas break. Location was great for walking everywhere. Went to a football and basketball game. The hotel staff is amazing. Scott was helpful all weekend. The rest of the staff were friendly, outgoing, and very knowledgeable about the area.That's what we like to hear!! Scott will be thrilled to hear he made an impact. Thanks for staying and we hope to see you again soon. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,I had a nice stay,"Check in: employee was very pleasant . Check in process took long, although the front desk did the best she could. The issue was that she was all by herself and so many people were checking in.Rooms: excellent,clean and spacious. Bed was very comfortable. Amenities were excellent as well. I wish bathroom had better privacy and ventilation.Location : fantastic, close to all attractions.Restaurant : I didnot try, so I don't know.Overall: nice experience , will be back.Happy to hear your enjoyed your stay overall and will be back we look forward to it!! Sorry about the delay getting you checked in, while we do our best to schedule according to our needs we occasionally run into unexpected busy periods. We will be sure to keep that under our radar.See you again soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Great Hotel!,"We was looking for a hotel that was nice but wasn't expensive and I found just that at the Aloft. I made a reservation and when I got there It went so smooth I was up to my room in less than 5mins and I had a preference to check in at 11:00am and it was granted with no extra charge. The room was very nice and clean and smelled good. The shower I LOVED and the full body mirror I couldn't stay out of. The staff was very nice and friendly. The hotel was quiet which I was hoping because I know they let animals stay there. Overall we really enjoyed our stay my boyfriend agreed this was one of the best hotels we ever stayed at.WOW!! We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your stay and that we were able to provide a first in class experience for you both. We hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Nice,"Tried out Aloft for the ADA rooms. Pleasantly surprised spacious rooms updated features. We will look for the brand in our travels. The receptionist was very friendly and knowledgeable of the area. I was waiting for the concierge to give a breakfast recommendation and she was busy so the receptionist gave us a few with different styles and directions turned out great. Thank you Aloft for a great stayDelighted to hear of your stay with us and appreciate your feedback on our ADA rooms. We hope you will stay with us again in the future,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,good place to stay near French quarter,"No need to infuse the air with that small/fragrance. Your other guests may like it, but I prefer natural air and so held my breath between the front door and the elevator.The room keepers can also be more gentle with closing the doors during their morning rounds, so as not to wake other rooms' occupants.Other than the above points, a good place to stay near French quarter.Truly thankful you enjoyed your stay and while we love the fresh air ourselves, that signature scent can be found around the world at all Aloft hotels. We appreciate the feedback regarding our housekeeping staff and will be sure to share with the department leader to help rectify that problem.Thank you again for your business and hope you'll be back soon,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Fab hotel,"This place is in the perfect location a short stroll to all the action on Bourbon st and surounding areas (just a pity Bourbon st was dug up during our stay) the hotel had everything we needed ....very comfortable bed....nice clean bathroom plenty of towels and coffee and a great tv There's always next time to see Bourbon in all of its glory, just means you've got to come visit us again. Thank you for staying and we appreciate your business. See you for round 2!!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,Nice hotel,"My wife booked this hotel for our conference. The room was nice and service was great if we requested anything they were quick to help. We didn't use the pool as it was usually raining when we would have used it. It would be nice to have a restaurant in the hotel although there are several places to eat nearby. The front lobby is kinda cool. Beds were comfortable and we had a good sleep. We wish not all lights were on one switch.Just another reason for you to return nothing better than a rooftop pool on a sunny day!Thanks for staying,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Great Stay!!!!,"I have to say I had a great stay,...The rooms were very nice and the staff was very helpful....What more can you askThe bar down stairs was nice to have so you did not need to go out if you really didn't want to. They are located within dozen of place for Uber Eats if your staying in. Awesome! Thank's so much for choosing Aloft NOLA for your needs, we hope you'll be back again soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,"Try it, you'll like it.","Great vision combined with high energy ,pushing hospitality into a my first stay in this aloft brand . Rates were reasonable. Location was great. Clean room. Large shower . Comfortable bed. Pet friendly. Other than thin walls , was pleased with Staff, modern theme, large clean room and shower area. Great! We have converted another happy guest and we are so glad that you gave us the chance. Thanks for trying out Aloft New Orleans Downtown."
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Very nice rooms,The rooms were very nice and spacious! The workers were friendly and very calm even though it was a big event going on in the city. The rooms were very clean and comfy beds. I enjoyed my stay overall.Clean and comfy is music to our ears. Thanks for the great review and we hope you get back to Aloft New Orleans Downtown!
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Excellent,"This was our first time staying at Aloft. The hotel is very clean and secure. The bed was amazing and made it hard to go out and explore. Conveniently located blocks away from the french quarter. They also give you coupons if you choose not to have your room cleaned. The Make a Green Choice program is great, especially for those of us who don't prefer our room be cleaned anyway. Thanks for the kudos, see you next time!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Mandatory stay while in New Orleans,"Mandatory stay while in Nola...the hotel is Centrally located to restaurants, French quarter, garden district or warehouse district! They have bikes to be used to tour the city. The service was impeccable and there 24 hours. The bar area very nice-I travel here every two months...you must make the Aloft your hotel of choice when in Nola.Easy access to everything NOLA has to offer is key to a great stay and having the bike rental on site makes it that much easier. We are glad you got to take advantage of our central local and hope to see you in two months!"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,1,Awful!,"I have stayed in some hotels in my time, but this was bad. If you want to experience an awful nights sleep, nasty ignorant staff, then this is for you. Southern hospitality it is not. I was not impressed with the layout of the room and the noise next door was horrendous.Thank you for taking time out of your day to share your comments about your recent stay with me. Please accept my sincere apologies for the difficulties and situations you encountered during your visit, I would like to find out a little bit more about the interaction with the staff so i can address approporately.

Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Outstanding and friendly facility,"They have great staff, pet friendly, rooms impecable, the coffee in the lobby really good and free, the lobby bar very enjoyable, perfect location, just the car parking should be more flexible and less expensive.We are thrilled to hear of your great experience! Ill be sure to share your feedback with our staff. Thanks for staying, we hope to see you in the future, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,"neat, clean and well organized","This property reminds me of being in northern europe. (esp. Sweden and Danmark) Very modern, few frills, and everything clean and useful. We did have our A/C unit go out, and they responded within minutes. When it happened the next day again....they just gave us a new room. Their problem-solving skills exceeded my expectations. A good team with a good system.Our staff will be thankful for your kind words while we hate you had an issue, we are glad we were able to correct that issue and you were able to enjoy the remainder of your stay. Thanks so much for staying and see you again next time!Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,Review,"Great location a block off canal and just outside French quarter, very nice rooms, spacious, not much privacy in bathroom space and somewhat see through shower glass pane into main room. Would be more ideal for couples then friends/family. Overall great atmosphere. Very happy, would book again.Thank you for taking the time to share your review of our hotel. We do have a bit of flare in the most of the bathrooms as you alluded but we certainly have rooms with a bit more modesty available, please be sure to note and request that when you book next time!See you soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,Solid Hotel in a Great Location,"Stayed here with a few friends for a weekend getaway. Nice bar/lounge in the lobby area with a decent sized commissary with snacks and drinks for sale. The rooms were nice and new. We watched some of the NCAA games in our room and the tv was a bit smaller than I would like but it was still a good picture. The location is probably the best part. Its about 3 blocks from Bourbon St which means its a short walk but far enough away not to be impacted by the noise. There still is some construction going on and the pool will not be completed until May, but overall, still a very solid stay.It's always great to hear that we have another satisfied guest! It seems to be a consensus that our location is key to having access to all that New Orleans has to offer yet far enough away to relax peacefully. Thanks, Kristi"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,A Haven,"I stayed at Aloft while attending a convention. It fulfilled all I sought. A modern and well run newer hotel away from the citys congestion well suited for a business traveler. It is a 15 minute walk to the convention center or you can take a shuttle one block away. Easy walk to the French Quarter. The rooms are sufficient and contemporary. Housekeeping was spot on and ranks high for cleanliness. The rooms start on the 11th floor so you are well above street traffic. I would suggest as others have to request a corner room with windows to avoid the cruise ship interior cabin feeling if you need it. Nice bar with specials and the rooftop pool is relaxing. Special mention needs to be extended to the hotels outstanding front desk staff specifically, Lindsey and Mark (who also worked the bar). Friendly, savvy, hardworking, and patient- they belong in hotel hospitality and deserve recognition. Their inherent superior communication skills exceed standard service training programs. I happily recommend this lodging while in NOLA!Our staff will be elated to hear of your stay with us. From housekeeping to the front desk and even the bar, it sounds like you enjoyed all aspects of the hotel. We hope to be your hotel of choice when in the Big Easy.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,One night stay in downtown.,"Modern looking hotel. Room lay out worked for smaller space. I thought is was weird that the door to the room opened directly into the bathroom. Didn't like that there was no self park, but I believe all hotels in downtown New Orleans have that.You'd be correct, most downtown NOLA properties are valet only. We understand Aloft isn't for everyone but truly appreciate you giving us a try. Thanks for staying! Yours in hospitality, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Great Place to Stay,"This hotel is just two block to Bourbon Street and close enough to walk alway to Cafe DuMonde. Safe area. Bed very comfortable and hotel perfectly clean and nice. I will stay here again every time I am in NOLA. LaQuinta rates for Sheraton level hotel. Great value at great prices, what a winner! Thanks so much for staying with us at Aloft New Orleans Downtown and taking the to post your review. Come back soon."
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,1,"Windows, will your room have them","Booked room on Concur, checked into room late, to my surprise the room had no (0) (zero) windows. An actual interior room. Not happy to learn this. Didn't see this in the booking. Not a happy camper...Sorry to hear of your disappointment with your room. We do realize those windowless rooms aren't for everyone. They are labeled when booking as Loft King Room but i'm not sure how your booking channel has that set up. If you would like, I'd be happy to take a look into that for you. We hope we have another opportunity to earn your business back please reach out to me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com or 504-312-7715.I hope to hear from you soon,Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Must stay!,"Great location ten min walk to bourbon/French quarter! The place is modern and funny and very clean. The staff is super friendly l. Stacy was very helpful and loved her energy. She helped us book a last min trip for the city/cemetery tour. You can tell she really likes what she does. Love the southern accent! I would def recommend this place!! YAY Stacy!! I will be sure to share your kudos with her as well as our entire staff. Thanks for choosing ALOFT NOLA for your stay, we hope to see you again on your next visit.Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,2,"Nice location, Bad Customer Service","I travel to New Orleans for business about once a month and have the privilege of staying in quite a few hotels in NOLA, but Aloft was a standout, even though is it located very close to most attractions, the staff left us with a bad taste in our mouths. At check in, we were helped by Jermal and it was the worst check in experience I've ever had (even at Motel 6 they at least make eye contact with you and answer your questions). Very cold and not friendly staff with the exception of the valet guys. They were very nice and professional. Once we got to our room, it was clean and spacious. I did not find anything wrong with it except the infamous bad water pressure in the shower and the fact that we only had 2 big towels (All hotels I've stayed at have had 4 big towels) We signed up for the SPG Green Choice at check in so the extra towels would had been nice and we actually never received the 5 vouchers for making the green choice. Aloft has a lot of potential because of their location. I am giving them another chance in late May, hopefully this time they listen to our requests and are more customer oriented.Thank you for staying with us this past week. I would like to apologize for your disappointment during your recent stay with us. I know we certainly have not met your expectations and we want so much to gain back your trust and loyalty. The feedback you provided will allow us to address specific information and in turn provide a superior service for our guests both now and in the future. It is unfortunate that you had a negative experience but we look forward to having you back here with us in May so we can show you how we have used your feedback and show you the hospitality our talent is truly made of!If I can do anything in the meantime, please contact me directly at Dixie.Kraussaloftneworleansdowntown.com."
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,Great Hotel!,"Stayed for two nights in a corner room which was light and airy, very well designed in a clean modern style. Beds very comfortable, great blinds on the Windows, no fussy furniture! Bathroom worked well, nice big vanity unit and a hairdryer that plugged in easily next to the huge mirror, for anyone who likes to dry their hair you'll know what I'm talking about! Sliding mirrored door to shower/toilet all gave the feeling of space. The only slight niggle was the a/c which was a bit noisy, not enough to bother us though. Easy walk to many places, shops and attractions. Will definitely stay Aloft again!!Come on back anytime! It's good to know that you enjoyed your stay with us and glad you found the room and location to your liking. Thanks for taking the time to share."
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,Voodoo in Nola,"Great atmosphere and artiness. Staff was super friendly and helpful and the bar and game room made it really fun to have your friends together. The live music was a nice touch. Breakfast bar a little too snack fish on a NOLA hangover but we enjoyed the access, the accessibility and the easy to use atmosphere.So we will see you and your friends back year again for round 2 ) Thanks for sharing your experience with us and we hope to see you guys again next year.Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,Nice modern hotel,"Very clean modern hotel with a nice bar on the main floor. They even had a band playing one night. Room was a good size , my only complaint was there wasn't a mirror in the bedroom area , only by the bathroom. Great location, within walking distance of everywhere we needed to go to. The Livealoft program is a great free concert series at most aloft's, so happy you got to enjoy that bit of local flavor while here. Be sure to check for concerts in your area at your local aloft. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,"Well priced, good location, spacious rooms, good onsite breakfast","The title says it all. Felt it was well priced for a good location (walking distance to bourbon and Frenchmen), very spacious rooms which helps when traveling in groups. Good onsite breakfast options.Thanks so much for taking the time to share your feedback, we are thrilled to learn of your great experience. We hope we will be your go-to hotel in NOLA. See you next time, Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,Nice and Clean,"Loved the convenience of staying in this CBD hotel which is so close to the French Quarter but without the price. Hotel is kinda minimalist but rooms were clean. Only reason four instead of five stars is the hallways and my room smelled kinda like a sweaty, bad-smelling locker room. I said something to the hotel and then the smell was gone. Thanks so much for your review. We are happy to hear we were able to resolve that issue you for you while here and hope youll be back again soon. Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Good hotel,"Located a couple of block from Canal Street in New Orleans, this hotel provided efficient and highly satisfactory service. The front staff is very helpful. The bed and pillows were VERY comfortable, more comfortable than in any other hotel I have stayed in. Once I had an almost equally comfortable bed in a Hilton, but this was tops. I would definitely return to this hotel chain.Wow! Thankful you've taken the time to share your great feedback with us and the Trip Advisor community. We have the Westin Heavenly Bed System, they do have some items for retail purchase in case you wanted to check those out. See you next time,Dixie Krauss, Assistant General Manager"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,Attractive New Hotel,"We chose Aloft because we were able to use our credit card points towards our stay and it was the closest and cheapest we could find the French Quarter. With that being said we are happy with our choice. When we first arrived we were greeted warmly by the front desk staff Jermal was great. We got to our room on the 12th floor and were happy with the amenities. The room was not as large as I would have thought, but it was comfortable and a non issue since we spent minimal time in the room. There was a coffee pot, a mini fridge, and lots of mirror space. Our view overlooked the Ritz Carlton and we were able to see their pool and patio area- pretty cool. The beds are comfortable and the towels didn't feel like sandpaper. They provide Bliss toiletries which was fine, however, I did not pack shampoo or conditioner and they offered a shampoo conditioner all-in-one which I did not care for (but my husband loved...). The vanity area has intense lighting good for makeup application!The lobby area is very nice and fun. They have a snack area for any cravings you have when you are there- premade salads sandwiches, candy, chips, fruit, yogurt, beer, juice, pop, etc. The lobby bar is very nice- good drinks and a fun environment. Lots of games and fun dcor. LaKisha (I hope I spelled that right!) was very friendly and did a great job. They do offer a pool table and computers/printer which came in handy to quickly print our boarding passes. The only issues we ran into was the room service for our room, they did the bare minimum in cleaning our room. The bed was always made, toiletries and towels were always replaced, however, that was about it. No trash was picked up and nothing was organized. When you go to a hotel, typically they neatly arrange your items so they can clean the room/bathroom/vanity completely, but this was not the case. Our toiletries were shoved to a corner or moved over so they could place new toiletries, I had a half eaten sandwich placed on a shelf instead of being thrown away, the coffee pot wasn't put back or the coffee replenished (but new coffee cups were given), whatever was left on the bed was thrown back on it, there was a bottle cap left on the floor... small things that added up. This wasn't huge issue, but enough of one to notice and let the front desk know as we checked out. Also, the elevator functioned oddly for my husband once. He was brought to the top floor and then back down to the lobby instead of being brought to our floor.. but that was not a huge deal.. just odd!Our friends who were staying on the 11th floor experienced some poor water pressure and cold water, however, we did not.The hotel is in a good location- two blocks from Canal and two blocks up from Bourbon- easy walking! The valet out from was super helpful when we were getting ready to leave by reserving us a taxi so we did not have to wait when we wanted one and put our items in the vehicle while we were checking out to make the process smooth and efficient. All in all, the hotel was a great choice and we'd recommend and stay there again. For being brand new, they did a great job!Fantastic! Thank you for your feedback, with us being a new property, reviewers like yourself help us get better! We are thrilled that you liked the property and all of the outlets like our WXYZ Bar and Re:fuel pantry. We cant wait to have you back here with us again soon.We truly appreciate your review and thank you again for staying with aloftnola.- Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,4,Nicely located - exceeded expectations.,"The Aloft came as advertised. It was more modern than the pictures on their website might lead you to believe. Green option was good, they do not refresh unless you ask them to. Nice bar with pretty good food in the hotel. 15 minutes or so to walk to the river and French Quarter. Staff were friendly and accomodating.Yay! We love when we exceed your expectations and thank you for letting us know. Appreciate the kind words and we look forward to seeing you back at Aloft New Orleans Downtown."
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Great Place to Stay.,"Great location about three blocks from Bourbon St. Very friendly staff. I would staff there again. If you take a car remember it cost 40/day to park here, but it cost that to park anywhere in New Orleans.You got it!! Parking is at a premium here in the city but our valet team is first in class and will be sure to take care of you. Thank you for staying, we hope you return again soon. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,What a wonderful girls weekend experience!!,"I was hesitant staying here but I am extremely happy I did, our room was a very spacey corner double and it had a wonderful view. Customer service was incredible, Kathy was able to check us in a little earlier and I forgot his name but made a mean bacon and egg croissant sandwich. Hotel is in a great location 2 blocks away from Bourbon and one from Canal. Close to everything but far enough to hear all the noise. I would definitely stay there again especially for the great rate we got.Thanks so much for your review! I always enjoy sharing comments like these with our staff and giving Kathy and our cook, Mike the kudos they deserve. We are delighted you had a great time here with us and we look forward to having you back with us again soon.Cheers,Dixie Krauss, Operations Manager"
Aloft New Orleans Downtown,5,Modern clean hotel in downtown New Orleans,"Clean and modern hotel.5 minutes to walk to the french quarter.friendly stuff.the only negative thing is the expensive valet parking service for about 45 dollars a day.we parked in a parking 2 roads away for 20 dollars per day (perdido street).So glad you enjoyed your time here with us, we hope you return again on your next trip. Valet is an expense here in downtown NOLA but our guys do a great job ensuring our guests are well taken care of. Dixie Krauss, Director of Operations"
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,4,Confortable hotel,"The hotel is very confortable, besides breakfast they offer wine tasting in the afternoons. The price is a bit expensive and the hotel stay a bit far from downtown Napa, so a car is required. Parking is free, which is a plus."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,5,New hotel clean and friendly,"New hotel, the rooms the lobby you notice that this is a new building. It was very clean, we enjoyed our room and the lobby.Staff was all friendly and the breakfast was good (usual Hampton Inn breakfast).Dear bens9,Thank you for your raving review of the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. Great to hear you enjoyed our Hampton breakfast as well as our friendly staff. We hope to see you again on your next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,4,I liked this hotel,"We were lucky to be one the first guest at this brand new hotel in Napa , we were Very satisfied. The staff although new they tried to do their best. Now when I travel I always check if Hampton inn hotel is near by ."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,4,Nice New Hotel,"Nice New Hampton Hotel. Rooms were very clean, Comfy Beds. Close to walking paths and down town Napa. Staff was friendly ! Great place to stay. Walking paths along the Napa River make it nice way to start the day.Dear Paul O,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We're glad to hear that you enjoyed our comfy beds and that you we're able to take advantage of our walking path that runs along the river just behind the hotel. We look forward to serving you again in the near future. Thank you, Serina Najar."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,5,Nice hotel. Staff is very new,This was a very nice Hampton Inn. Lobby area is very nice. Negatives- Breakfast is very busy. Not enough seating. Food is just OK. Our room did not get cleaned until after 5PM. We just got back from all day wine tasting. Maids did not knock they just walked in.
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,4,Good place to stay in Napa,"This is a newer place, clean and friendly service. For the business traveler this is great, one of the more economically friendly hotels in Napa. The location is good too, easy on and off and not far far from downtown. I slept great, nice clean comfortable bed. Overall really nice. Dear JimWard99,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. I appreciate your feedback on our clean and friendly service. Thank you again for taking the time to review, Serina Najar."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,4,Nice New Hotel in a Great Location,"My daughter and I stayed here for a Mother's Day getaway. The hotel is in a great location, especially if you're here when they have the Napa Farmers Market located at the edge of the parking lot. There is also a nice movie theater in the same parking lot. This is a new hotel with a nice layout. The housekeeping needs some improvement both in the rooms and the breakfast area. They do offer free wine tasting in the evenings which was nice."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,5,It was pleasant and relaxing,"The staff is all very friendly, and facility was great! Over all a great experience. Everything for a family Vacation. Also there is a cute little farmers market and movie theater, and restaurants nearby."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,5,Best place to stay in Napa!,"A gorgeous hotel! Not a typical Hampton Inn. Easy to find and the location is convenient to vineyards, downtown Napa and you can walk to restaurants, shopping and movie theater. Inside the hotel is gorgeous and the guest rooms are all suites and huge! Mini fridge, huge shower, I could live in this room!"
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,5,Perfect,Beautiful brand new hotel. The staff performs at 110. Great location everything you need is within 5 miles of this hotel. Comfortable room great service overperforming staff makes this hotel the best place to stay in Napa.
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,3,Bait and switch - best for business travelers,"This hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and beds were comfortable. The ONLY warning I will give is to those couples looking for a romantic getaway in Napa. One of the selling points (in my opinion) on their site was the comfortable outdoor seating area with a beautiful fireplace. If there are private parties booked that area won't be available to you until 10 p.m. We were disappointed and unaware of this as our hotel had private parties every night we were there."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,4,Nice Hotel at Good Price,"My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for one night while we were vacationing in Napa Valley with another couple. The hotel is located in a commercial area, so it lacks the ambiance of a hotel that is located in the hear of wine country. And it is a bit of a longer drive to get to the main roads where the wineries are located.That being said, the lobby of the hotel is very nicely appointed and they do have a good offering of bottles of wine for sale. The staff at the front desk were very nice and were helpful with recommendations and directions. Our room was very comfortable. There was plenty of space and the beds were firm and friendly. The bathroom was clean and included the expected amenities. It was also a very good value, as similar hotels in the area were significantly more expensive. If you're looking for a comfortable place to stay close to Napa Valley and you're not looking for a romantic experience, this hotel would be an excellent choice.Dear ltt18,Thanks for taking the time to write your review of the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback. As our location is less than 2 miles to downtown we are very close to several wineries in surrounding areas like the Carneros area as well as conveniently near the entrance to highway 29 to reach the other wineries up the valley. It's great to hear that the staff was nice and provided you with recommendations as well as directions to your destinations. At Hampton we provide a great value with complementary breakfast, parking and internet just to name a few. Thank you again for staying with us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa. Best Regards, Serina Najar."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,4,Great stay,"Great stay. I would recommend staying here for business, family or couple weekend. Close to downtown Napa and Sonoma. The employees here are exceptional! So many options for breakfast. They also offer wine tasting if youre around at 5!"
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,4,New Hampton in Napa,"Good new option for hotels in Napa. Centrally located near new retail center south of downtown Napa. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Very typical Hampton Inn room setup. Nothing special, but reasonable alternative to other hotels in the area. Dear P5041IYwilliamk,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your feedback. There are several options for hotels in Napa and we love to provide our guest with a Hampton value of complementary internet, complementary parking, complementary breakfast, our added features of pool and spa as well as a nice patio area with a fireplace and 2 fire pits which not all Hampton's have. We thank you again for your feedback and hope to see you again on your next trip to Napa Valley. Best Regards, Serina Najar."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,1,Our confirmed reservation was cancelled day of check in because we were the last ones to check in due overbooking,"I have never written a review, good or bad, but the experience at Hampton from their staff especially Kalah was so atrocious that I felt the need to prewarn people about this particular employee who was rude, unprofessional and argumentative and when I called to inform the manager of the experience, I received no calls back. The hotel overbooks and apparently doesn't care.Dear Cinandyoung,Thank you for taking the time to express yourself about your experience with the Hampton Inn Suites. As we always try to do our best given the circumstances and situation at hand. I apologize that we fell short in being able to accommodate you as our guest. I appreciate your feed back and will turn this situation into a learning lesson on how we can handle this situation better next time. I thank you again for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We hope you give us the opportunity to make this stay up on you next trip to Napa Valley. Thank you again, Serina Najar."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,5,Beautiful Hotel,"What a beautiful Hampton Inn in Napa. Great Location within walking distance of a movie theatre, gym, a few restaurants and Starbucks. The rooms are a nice size. The beds were comfy. They had DirecTv which is always a huge Plus! But the bathroom was awesome. Love, love, love the extra lighting and shelving for us ladies. The only thing I would add would be a wall magnifying mirror like the Marriott has. Even with all the amazing light it was hard to get up close to the mirror to do my makeup because of the size of the nice vanity."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,5,Amazing and Beautiful Property and Kalah was Awesome!,"I had stopped by here with my family just to stop by. We did not stay, but rather wanted to see this new property. It is near the Napa River. There is also a Century theater and an In-Shape in the same parking lot. The grounds were immaculate. Once I walked in, all I could say was WOW!. It was beautiful, modern and I felt comfortable as I walked in. We purchased some waters from the gift shop as we were driving around through Napa, Calistoga, and St. Helena. Kalah (I believe that was her name- she had curly brown hair), was so warm upon us walking into the lobby. I asked if I could take a look around just to see what the common areas looked like, she said absolutely! It was beautiful. I am looking forward to my future stay(s) here. I will say as I passed a young lady, Danielle. It was like she did not want to be there or she was having an off day. She did not acknowledge me as a guest as she passed by or even at the desk. Overall still 5 Stars. Kalah (hopefully that was her name) was AWESOME! See you Soon!Dear LeMoura G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Your comments especially the Wow are bells to my ears. We truly do have a unique Hampton capturing the Napa Valley throughout the building. It was very satisfying to hear your awesome comments about Kalah. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to the Napa Valley. Thank you, Serina Najar."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,5,"New, Popular 3-star Hotel","This Hampton Inn is new and well-appointed, and seems to be a popular choice for people touring wineries, as our group was. There was a little street noise in my room, but tolerable.The staff were uniformly pleasant and helpful, from front desk to housekeeping.Breakfast is of the standard you would expect for this type of hotel, with some reasonable choices and slight changes from day to day.It is not located in the center of Napa, so to go to most restaurants, you need a car."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,5,Stay At the Hampton Inn Suites,"If you are going to Napa, you must stay at the Hampton Inn Suites. The hotel is very clean, very friendly, and the rooms are updated. Many perks like cookies. tea, coffee in the lobby during the day, complimentary hot breakfast, and a snack bar to take with us to San Francisco. Definitely want to stay at the Hampton Inn Suites again.Dear 48mimiy,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa.

We are very honored to have earned your recommendation and thankful you enjoyed your stay with us. It's great to hear that you had a relaxing time with us and we hope to see you again soon. Warmest Regards, Serina Najar."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,3,Booking Problems,"The hotel room itself was clean, spacious, and in good repair. We, however, had problems from beginning to end with the booking process. We blocked rooms for an anniversary party. Guests were either told the block was full or didn't exist. My husband and I extended our stay by one day upon check-in. We received 4 phone calls from the front desk by different people asking if we were checking out. Front desk staff was very disorganized and uninformed. I would not recommend this particular hotel.Dear jenniferrB6116DR,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We truly appreciate all your feedback. I will personally be looking into the details of your blocked rooms. We always want to be sure that the entire team is always on the same page and from your comments it looks as if we may have missed a step. I truly apologize for any over site on our end and I will be sure we button up those missed items you mentioned. I thank you again for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa and will be sure to pass along this information to the proper individuals. Best regards, Serina Najar."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,4,Recommended,"I went with my family. The hotel is very new and service is good. On the downside it's far from Napa downtown and farther from the wine yards. Breakfast can get very crowded. There is a cinema and some restaurant at walking distance if you don't want to drive. Good place if you don't want to drive further to get to the attractions. Dear Alejandro M,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We thank you for your feedback and comments. We are located near several restaurants and the Cinema which is very convenient for travelers to the area. There are over 500 wineries in Napa and depending on which wineries you are looking to travel to our hotel does have easy access to the local highway to get you to your winery destination. We thank you again for your valuable feedback and hope to serve you on your next trip to Napa, Serina Najar."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,5,A Great New Place to Stay in Napa,"This place is ideally located with theaters, supermarkets, fast food, fine restaurants, all near by. The architecture is really beautiful and it is brand new. It provides easy access to downtown Napa as well as to the main highway north to all the wineries. My room was on the ground floor, No. 130 and there was some noise from upstairs translated below but not bad. Also had really nice, big screen, TVs.Dear TSCClovisCa,Thank you so much for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. I appreciate your awesome feedback, compliments of our hotel's location and arthitectural features. Thank you again for staying with the Hampton Inn SUites Napa, we hope to serve you again in the near future."
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,5,Great location,Hotel is in a great location for Napa and Sonoma wine tasting. Good breakfast and wine tasting from 5 to 6 pm in the lobby. Clean hotel with nice patio. Decent workout room and friendly staff make for a pleasant stay.
Hampton Inn and Suites Napa,5,Great property!,"This a super nice Hampton. The desk staff is friendly, the breakfast was delicious. Our room was spotless. The beds are super comfortable. We had a river view room with a balcony. It was nice to be able to relax on the balcony.We had an issue with the thermostat and maintenance came up promptly--turns out it was operator error! Asked for extra towels one evening and they were brought up immediately. On Tuesdays and Saturdays there is a nice Farmer's Market just a few yards away (I believe it closes in October until next season). A grocery store within walking distance. We definitely recommend!Dear PeggyS513,Thank you for taking the time to review the Hampton Inn Suites Napa. We appreciate your valuable feedback, as well all the great things you mentioned about our friendly staff and comfortable beds. Our balcony rooms do have a different thermostat unit than the others and typically we do get calls about them not operating. Unfortunately you do need to be within so many feet of the unit for it to operate properly and this typically take care of the issue. The farmer's market is definitely coming to an end, I would anticipate it to end come November. We're glad to hear that you recommend us and we hope to see you on your next trip to Napa Valley.

Hampton Inn & Suites Dallas/Cockrell Hill I-30,5,"Yay, no bed bugs","My daughter and I went to Texas for a concert at the Verizon and chose this hotel based on location, reviews, and previous experience with Hampton Inn Suites. The mattresses were so comfortable and no evidence of bedbugs. The staff was great. The breakfast was delicious. I wish we could have stayed longer."
Hampton Inn & Suites Dallas/Cockrell Hill I-30,4,Nice Place to lodge,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and the service is always excellent and the property is well keep. I am concerned about security whenever I travel. This property has twenty four hour security and the location is perfect for those who want access to Dallas, Grand Praire, Arlington or Fort Worth"
Hampton Inn & Suites Dallas/Cockrell Hill I-30,4,"Nice place, friendly staff","I recently stayed in the Hampton Inn Suites Dallas/Cockrell Hill. The room was clean and had everything we needed. The breakfast was ok, we always found something we could eat. Nice touch to have coffee 24 hours at the desk, and we were delighted with the chocolate chip cookies upon our arrival. The staff are friendly and attentive to... More"
Hampton Inn & Suites Dallas/Cockrell Hill I-30,5,Great Stay - Would Go Back,"Really nice hotel. Room was fresh and clean. Fluffy pillows and comfy bed. Housekeeping was good. I liked , the larger batheroom and shower, the coffee cubie in the bathroom, the shelf under the sink - I used it to tuck my toiletries away, Other notes - front desk person friendly and nice, complimentary breakfast was good and above average...

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,3,A very convenient place with SMALL parking spaces,"Every night when we came back to the hotel, numerous spots were open. We were delighted. Until we figured out why. It appears that someone designing the spaces are attempting to put as many as possible there, so the spots are very narrow. Even in a midsize car, you cannot park in many of the spots, because someone has parked over the lines, because the spaces are too small. It's like a domino effect. So you can't park unless you want someone dinging your car door. Because of this, we had to find parking very far away from our room. The hotel is very convenient and away from down town. The Old Town Shuttle is a good idea, but it runs only once and hour. It's always packed because of this and the fact that it services four hotels. It was a waste of 20. The rooms were clean, the pool was hot as a sauna, and the breakfast was okay. We would stay again.Dear Phillip H,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. Unfortunately Parking on this Island is a hot commodity, but I must agree that some of the spaces do seem narrow. We are also continuing to work on how we can make our shuttle better. I will be share you comments to our team so that we can try to make the correct adjustments. Please feel free to contact my Directly if there is anything that I can do in the future.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manger"
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,4,Comfy!,"Very nice hotel! The employees were all very helpful, the rooms were very comfortable and clean, and everything in the rooms, the pool, and the lobby looked clean and up to date. The rates were really good and the location is the perfect driving distance from all the restaurants and stores. This hotel definitely aided in providing us with a positive Key West experience. The only negative thing that I have to say is about the the breakfast. There was no fruit! The only thing they had fruit wise were oranges. It would have been nice if they had fruits like bananas and apples paired up with those oranges. Other than that everything else was A plus.Dear natalianieves22,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel and providing your feedback. We are Happy that you had a Positive Key West Experience, and enjoyed your stay with us. Also thank you for letting me know about the Fruit. We do usually have Bananas as well as cut fruit on the buffet and I will be looking into it so it doesn't happen again. We hope to see you back in Key West again very soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager"
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,5,Great Stay,"I was with four other people on a birding trip to watch the hawk migration. We spotted over 50 species of birds as we traveled across the keys. The hotel is new. The room was spacious and I loved the shower, microwave, and mini frig. The breakfast was wonderful and allowed us to make an early start for our birding. I commend Rosemary Johnson, an employee, that assisted me in finding ice, entering the pool area, and making me feel welcome even though it was late at night. Thank you for a lovely experience.Thank you for your comments. So glad you had a great stay. Rosemary is one of many of our amazing team members here to assist our guests. Thank you for staying with us. Hope you come back again to explore more of this wonderful bird sanctuary habitat."
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,2,Not worth it,"We have traveled to all areas of the US and realize high tourist areas such as this are normally higher priced lodging. However, when you pay a higher price for a hotel you expect the establishment to provide an equal value for your dollars. Not the case here. The front desk staff, both in the early evening and in the morning, have very poor customer service skills. We felt we were disturbing them any time we approached them. Also, the walkways and exterior areas have not been cleaned in months. The breakfast was bad! Never again!Dear Don G,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so we can better serve our Guests. Reading through your review I see the we fell short of your expectations. I apologize for the service that was provided. I will be sharing your comments with my staff, so that we can learn fro our short falls.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager"
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,4,Excellent find at the end of the road..,"Spent one night here after travelling from Orlando through the Everglades and the Keys. Excellent first impression, clean, bright lobby, quick check in and a fantastic concierge who provided us with maps and advised on local attractions, etc. The room was a good size with TV, fridge, adequate storage space and complimentary toiletries and hairdryer in the bathroom. I was travelling with a friend and had booked a King room prior to arrival (there had been no other options on the website), however, reception offered us double queen room at no extra cost on check in. Breakfast consisted of hot and cold items sausage patties, eggs, waffles, bagels, toast, pastries, cereal, yoghurt, orange juice, tea/coffee. Good quality and plenty available. Available in the lobby and included in the room rate.The only thing that lets this hotel down slightly is the location. The main Street in Key West is Duval street, which is a good hours walk from the hotel. A taxi costs upwards of 20 dollars. We had a rental car and ended up driving a lot of the street parking is permit only and the car parks are expensive but we managed to park for free on a residential street. Perhaps a shuttle to and from the hotel would be a nice extra touch.A good hotel, would stay again if travelling back to Key West.Thank you for your comments and feedback. So glad you enjoyed your visit to our property and had an excellent first impression. The team does an amazing job maintaining the cleanliness of the rooms, and getting our guest checked in quickly so they can enjoy the Island. Thanks for staying with us. Hope to see you back soon."
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,4,"Not bad, clean","The Fairfield Inn Suites Key West at The Keys Collection in Key West, was a clean hotel, a little out of Key West. There was a shuttle into Key West proper, but it was crowded do to other hotels in the same area give the shuttle free as a perk, at the Fairfield Inn it was 20/ day/ room. We did some things on the side of the island that the Inn on. Key West Botanical Garden, and Lazy Dog Kayak and Paddle Boards which were both great. Overall a good stay, Marriott has to update their breakfasts, have stayed in many Marriott properties, the breakfast is always the same.Dear Thomas M,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager"

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,5,Amazing Customer Service,"We were looking for a hotel at the last minute. As soon as we walk in the staff were very courteous and friendly, very helpful in finding the best pricing and fulfilling my hotel needs. I was serviced by Davian, she was very willing and helpful. I commended her for the outstanding service she provide. Next time we visit Key West this will be our place to stay.Dear Catherine A,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We are Happy to see that you enjoyed your stay with us and that our staff was very courteous and friendly. It is always nice to see our staff mentioned. We hope to see you back in Key West soon!Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager"
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,5,Great hotel! Superb staff!,"We booked through hotels.com. When we got to the hotel, it seemed to be taking a long time for the manager, Angel Torres, to check us in. Turns out they were updating their fire code system and all the reservations for rooms with king size beds were being taken out of commission for any reservation that was longer than two nights. He tried to override the computer, but it seems computers are now running the world. He very politely inquired if we would mind a room with 2 beds. I couldn't really understand why anyone would really consider that a big deal, since now I had a bed to throw all my clothes on and another one to sleep in. Once he assured me that the room was the same size as the king I told him to go ahead and do it. He then proceeded to comp us the shuttle (which runs 22/day per room) for our entire stay, as well as giving us coupons for complimentary drinks at the hotel bar. I asked him to also give us free parking to which he responded that he had, the previous week, reversed their policy of charging for parking. I told him to make sure to put that on the website because that could be major deterrence for some people. What more could one ask for!! We definitely came out ahead and he was so apologetic about the whole thing. The room was huge, clean and comfortable. The pool is lovely, the FREE breakfast had a huge variety of items to choose from. No question we would definitely stay here again and will strongly recommend it to any friends who might choose Key West as their destination.Donna, the concierge was also great. Gave great recommendations and lots of coupons for stuff on Duval Street.Thank you for choosing the Fairfield Inn Suites at The Keys Collection for your recent travels to Key West. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay."
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,5,"Huge, clean room!","Stayed here for 4 nights. Price was on the lower end of choices on Key West so we were prepared for some short comings. We were very surprised at the cleanliness of the grounds and size if the room given the price bracket. We had room 146, which put us on the inside, bottom floor. Very comfy king size bed, small fridge, dresser, and desk didn't come close to filling up the room. I paced it off to about 20x16! The bathroom was also spacious. No tub but a glass enclosed shower the size of a tub with plenty of pressure and hot water. The included breakfast was what I'd call a Continental Plus, as it also had scrambled eggs, sausages, and DIY fresh made waffles. Heated pool and pool bar too! Would definitely stay here again and highly recommended! Thank you for your comments. So glad you enjoyed our spacious clean rooms. Thank you for staying with us and recommending us to all of your friends."
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,5,Poolside Bartender,"Steve the Bartender was very knowledgable about the local area and he had many restaurants to recommend, so many local restaurants to us, it was so hard to choose from. We decided to eat at The restaurant Hogfish. He also gave us a ten percent coupon to us for our meal. He also makes the BEST Pia Coladas. Great bartender at poolside..Thank you for your comments. Steve is an amazing team member. He welcomes all of our guests with great libations and wonderful ideas on what to see and explore on the Island. Thanks for staying with us."
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,5,Awesome!!! Highly recommend!!!,"Great place to stay in the keys at an affordable price without sacrificing quality. Location: not on the beach but within driving/ biking distance to downtown and quiet. On site is a biking company to rent bikes or scooters from definitely recommend. Their kiosk is located next to the pool bar.Room: clean room, clean bedding/sheets, bed was medium comfort but we slept fine Pool: beautiful and big it wasn't crowded at all so you could enjoy it an any time. Lounge chairs were comfortable and cabanas were nice on a first come first serve basis. The pool bar was very nice with a variety of drinks. I wouldn't recommend the pool food with the exception of the wings and fries which were really good. Try some of the local beers on tap my favorite was the Crazy Lady very smooth. Free Breakfast: continental breakfast with a variety of fruits, waffles, eggs, bagels, cereal, and coffee etcOverall : Had a very relaxing and fun two day stay here. I highly recommend it to anyone going down to the keys. I definitely plan to be back here on my next trip down. Dear Susana L,Thank you for taking the time to Review our Hotel. We are very Happy that you had a Nice Stay and enjoyed our Breakfast and Pool. We hope to see you back in Key West very soon for another Nice stay with us.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager"
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,5,Excellent stay overall,Everything about our stay from the moment we checked in was a very positive experience. Our room was clean and had everything we needed. The pool area was also nice and clean with plenty of towels and loungers available. The breakfast area was also clean and well attended to. We were also given a one hour late checkout which made my daughter extremely happy as it gave her a chance for one more swim before we left. A perfect stay while we were in the Keys!Thank you for the five star review. So glad to hear our folks at the front office were able to extend a later departure so your daughter could get that one last swim!! Thank you for sharing your experience and we look forward to welcoming you back to our little island!
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,4,Modern Hotel. Customer Service Needs Work,"This is one of the newest hotels in Key West. It's located in the new section of town and is about a 15 minute car ride to Duval St. The rooms and facilities are modern. The customer service was variable and I was disappointed with their lack of assistance when we encountered an issue with our air conditioner. Parking is free, wifi is decent and free, there is also a free breakfast which was nice. Best of all, no resort fee. Dear netgeek,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We take all of our reviews seriously so that we can better serve our guests. I apologize for that lack of assistance regarding your air conditioner, and I will be getting with my staff so that they better assist our guests better when they are having issues with our hotel.

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,5,Great Hotel,"I stayed here with a couple friends. Very friendly hotel! The weather was terrible, cold rainy, in the Keys. The staff was super helpful in helping us find things to do. The location is far from all the action, but a quick cab ride away... worth the stay. Very clean.Thank you for sharing your comments with all of our trip adviser guests. I am sorry the weather did not cooperate on your recent trip to the Keys,you will need to come back to enjoy the Keys sunshine. Thank you for staying with us."
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,4,Another visit to Key West,"The folks here have paid attention to detail and made this a wonderful place to stay.

The Great location makes it easy enough to get around without being to close to downtown.Thank you for your comments.

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,5,"Beautiful, Quiet, Clean Place to stay!","The location wasn't exactly where i thought it was but that was partly my fault, there are 2 Fairfield's in Key west and I got confused with the second one. However it was nice and close to airport which is what I was looking for at first. The Hotel had a nice room, Clean, and everything you needed to just have a nice stay. They had a contential breakfast at the hotel and that was nice. It had a great selection with staff that worked really hard the entire time to keep everything stocked, cleaned, and looking nice. It was just a nice hotel all around and we couldn't beat the price. Very happy with our stay here.Dear Ashley663,Thank you for taking the time to review our Hotel. We are Happy that you enjoyed your stay here with us. We hope you had a relaxing time here in Key West and we hope to see you back in again soon.Sincerely,Eric B - Hotel Manager"
Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Key West at The Keys Collection,4,More than a sign change,"If you're familiar with Key West, you'll recognize the location as the old Day's Inn. But the changes are more than just the signage. I figured it would be a new sign and fresh paint. Not so. A number of years back, numerous hotels on the entry end of the island were taken out of the inventory for revitalization, including the Days Inn. They gutted it, and the changes are significant.The room was large, as was the bath. Just a shower, no tub in room 148, which was fine. Bed was comfy, a/c worked great. In fact, I had no complaints at all about this property. The complimentary breakfast included pork sausage, turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, omelets, make your own waffles, plus pastries and fresh fruit. Not your typical complimentary breakfast.Pool is large enough, and plenty of lounges, as well as canopies. There's a Tiki Bar and music playing. Now for what may be a concern for some.The hotel is at the entry to the island. All traffic on or off the island passes through the intersection out front. Since the hospital is on Stock Island (just next to Key West) ambulances going there, pass right by. Sirens don't bother me, but if you get upset over them....well, since the island is 2 miles by 4 miles, maybe this isn't the place for you. There were numerous sirens from law enforcement, fire, and ambulances each day, but I didn't notice them at night.I had no complaints about this place. The only shortfalls, were that there was only one wastebasket in the room, which was next to the computer desk. Another in the bath would have been nice. Also, the parking spaces were a bit narrow, but nothing I couldn't deal with.Front desk and all staff were great. Property gets a recommended!Please note: There are two Fairfield Inns on the island. One at 2400 N. Roosevelt, and this one at 3800.Thank you for the very detailed review. We truly appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with our readers. Glad to hear you had time to enjoy our breakfast and enjoy some sun poolside. We look forward to welcoming you back to the Keys Collection!"
The Villa Toscana,5,Comfortable B+B,I found my room + hotel to be just as advertized. Tnhe location puts you in easy walking distance of Wrigley Field.It is also very handy to both bus and L.
The Villa Toscana,5,Excellent location/ excellent value,"I had looked into Villa Toscana before but it was completely full. Last week I lucked out. The location was convenient, the room was comfortable, the innkeeper helpful and the overall experience excellent. Definitely a place I would stay again."
The Villa Toscana,4,Great little b&b,"I was a little nervous about staying at a bb in Wrigleyville Place was great, small but very clean . walking distance to Wrigley field make sure to get a room with a bathroom"
Bed and Breakfast Inn Seattle,5,"Lovely, comfortable, welcoming","Spent four nights visiting in Seattle and a big part of the pleasure was staying at Bed and Breakfast Inn. I arrived late, which was no issue, since Shannon and I communicated via text. I got a quiet downstairs room, bath down the hall. All spotless, nice waffle-weave robe in the closet. Breakfasts were superior (sitting in the sunny kitchen... More"
Quality Inn Midway Airport,5,Awesome,"My family and I stayed here for a night, the front desk guy and girl that were there are super nice they treated us with a warm smile and made us feel at home! . Awesome customer service and also the breakfast that they had was very good as well and our bed was very comfortable and clean as well as the room. Everyone working there was very friendly ."
Rodeway Inn,4,Retro and good value,This is a great place to stay to sleep. Thats what I was looking for. Staff is friendly. Rooms are clean. Older hotel but updated. Can be loud as this is a motel. I felt very safe. Parking is easy. Good value for the money.
Freehand Chicago,1,I liked it better as a transient hotel - it wouldnt be on Priceline,"Really I know 3 stars on Priceline can be dicey, but really Really We got a quad. Four 5 1/2 foot long bunk beds. Numbered one to four. With a stack of folded sheets. And a 2 by 2 shower. Really How did this get on Priceline in the first place And how did it get any stars I am only writing this now because it is 1:30 in the morning and my dorm was like a library compared to this place. Decades ago. How did this get on Priceline I have stayed at more than 40 hotels in Chicago on Priceline over the years, but this is the first time I have stayed in a hostel. A hostile. Really I wish zero stars was a choice, but that would be too many. I know all the hipster comments I will get on this, but please, keep them to yourself.Hello Steve P, Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to review your stay. I so sorry that your stay was disappointing due to the room layout not being as expected for our star rating. We are reviewing your reservation with our booking partners to ensure that no other guest encounters a similar issue. Please feel free to let our front desk know during any future stays if we can do anything to make your stay more enjoyable. I hope we can see you back again very soon for what I am sure will be a better experience."
WoodSpring Suites Phoenix I-10 West,5,Thank you for a great stay!,"Hello. I stood at this woodspring suites for two weeks. While I was there and I had a great stay. When I walked in the the lobby to check in the manager and the general manager greeted me with kindness and it felt really good. When I got to my room, the room felt very clean. I stood at this hotel due to work. I will be returning shortly and I will also tell my other co-workers to stay there.

Holiday Inn North Phoenix,3,Nice but...,"Looking forward to a romantic stay, and our room offered a deep soaking tub, but when we checked in, I was told that all they had were ""normal""tubs. We were disappointed. Other than that, we had a nice stay."
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,5,Newly remodeled and clean.,"For the cost of this hotel, I was extremely surprised on how nice, clean and modern looking it was. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful with anything we needed, but most importantly I felt comfortable there because it was safe and secure and the inside and outside was well kept. I also found out it was recently remodeled. Would def stay there again."
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,1,Holiday Inn North Phoenix,"A disorderly mess from the start. When we checked in and got up to our room it wasn't clean and the beds were not made. On the second day of our stay we returned to our room at 4:00 to find the room has not been cleaned but our towels had been removed and items had been moved in our room. When we inquired, the manager stated no one has been in our room insisting we had been the only ones to enter. At no point was he apologetic or reasonable in regards to our concerns. At this point I decided to check out. I made the error of prepaying through Expedia and now the hotel is avoiding their attempts to refund the nights I did not stay. A terrible experience all around in a poorly managed hotel."
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,2,Poor service and food isn't good,We asked in the morning about breakfast and they told us that a free continental breakfast is only served at a holiday in express.  Then we ordered our breakfast.  When the food arrived the food orders were small and not cooked properly.  For the price we paid for breakfast we could have gone to a nice restaurant in town and the food would have been better and more plentiful. Then when checking out holiday Inn charged us an additional fee.
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,2,bad breakfast,break fast is an apology of a breakfast..Even ordinary hotels in third world serve better breakfast..
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,5,"Phil,the director of sales was awesome","My wife had a birthday party at theHoliday Inn North Phoenix.The event we had was wonderfully planned by Phil McIlveen,the hotel's director of sales.He helped in planning a great party within our budget.Phil went above and beyond his limits to ensure that the event was successful.The staff were courteous and very ready to listen and help out wherever and whenever we needed them.We will surely have more events in the future at this location and we will send referrals to Phil.Thank you for the hospitality.George"
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,1,Business meeting,"It was terrible i will never stay there again. Dirty, noisy, tv didnt work. The staff was a joke"
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,1,Never again,The had a bad smell. It smells like wet carpet or maybe mildew.
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,5,High class all the way,"When I open the room I was amazed how great it was. The bed, the pillows, the sheets, the towels, the bath. I had no idea for the price what a great place I would get"
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,2,Clean but noisy,The room was nice and clean. The only downsides were the A/C system and location. The A/C system was very loud and did not cool the room adequately. The location was right next to the freeway onramp (noisy) and the neighborhood was sketchy. I will not stay here again.
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,3,Nothing Special,"While everything was ""OK"", there was nothing special or even extra OK about this hotel. The walls are paper thin, it's right off of the freeway, no free breakfast........ Just OK."
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,2,"Overpriced, loud, and uncomfortable.",This hotel was awful. It was so noisy you could hear EVERYTHING. Lots and lots and lots of kids running and screaming the entire night. Guess it might be good for a family but unless you have wild children it is not worth it. I heard every car outside. One of our pillows had dirt on it. We booked a king bed and got two queens. It smelled weird. It was dated. An elevator was out so it always took forever to go up or down. The parking was cramped and limited. Save your money and don't waste it on this place.I have stayed at nicer Motel 6's.
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,4,Right for the price,I was traveling for work during the spring training season. The price was right at this hotel. The room was comfortable but the surrounding area was not very nice.
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,4,Great value for the dollar,"Wasn't expecting much from this hotel due to the low rate, however the staff was very organized. I called earlier in the day to let them know I would not be arriving until 11pm. The front desk staff had my key and paperwork sitting out when I arrived. I was in the room in a few minutes.The room itself, had a real king size comfortable bed in it. The room was decorated well. The bathroom was neat, a shower with just a glass wall.The restaurant and bar were very nice, although I only went to the free continental breakfast.The hotel looks like it was updated within 10 years, but then has had alot of use.Only room issues were the shower and bathroom drywall had taking a beating with the lack of a shower curtain, it should be fixed. Looks like the maintenance staff just threw some spackle and painted over the water damage.My room faced the highway, so it was rather loud all night, however the AC was loud enough to drown out the noise. If you stay more than one night I would suggest getting a room facing the other way. The TV only has basic channels, no HBO or Showtime."
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,4,"Yes, I will stay there again!",The hotel was easy to get to with smiling welcoming staff. The room was Clean and ready for use. I'll return there when in town again!
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,3,Inexpensive hotel,Hotel was very clean and room was ready upon arrival.
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,4,Nice hotel for the price,This hotel serves its purpose. We stayed here when visiting Phoenix for spring training. Most hotels were booked and very expensive. This was a bit out of the way but worth the savings. Room was updated and clean. Fabian at the front desk was great!
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,3,"Nice Hotel, could be better","Pleasant stay, friendly staff,  On the internet site it claims that there is complimentary breakfast, but there was no complimentary breakfast"
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,2,NOT TOTALLY BAD,The heating unit didn't work in the first room I was moved to another room. The dinner menu in the restaurant was mostly sandwiches personally I eat sandwiches for lunch not dinner. I did try the burger one night and the cook cooked every bit of the juice out of the meat I might as well have had some of the desert sand.
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,3,OK for the money and convenient to the interstate,"My first night, my room was ok, but the AC fan or housing made a racket. I actually removed the plastic covering because it was broken and I thought that's what was rattling...wrong. I probably should have requested a new room, but by then I had my toiletries unpacked and didn't feel like moving. I was tired, so I slept through the noise, no problem. My second night I asked for a different room - the AC was still noisy, must just be 'normal'. The halls smelled a little musty, but the shining light of the stay was the front desk and housekeeping personnel. I had forgotten an expensive temperpedic pillow in my first room that I take with me when I travel. I didn't notice that I didn't have it until I was ready to go to bed the 2nd night (in a different room). The front desk people were very attentive, but housekeeping had gone home for the night or something and the front desk didn't have the key to their storage room....SO, I had to wait until I checked out the next morning to get me pillow back. But I DID get my beloved pillow back, so, all's well that ends well."
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,5,Convienient,It was great and staff were very friendly. Wish I could've stayed longer.
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,1,Toxic,Garbage hotel beware do not use the toxic water there if you shower in it you will smell like waste water
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,1,Horrible!!',This hotel has bedbugs!! The staff acted like it wasn't a big idea!! Don't stay here!!
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,1,Maintenance Issues,"Room 217. Shower flow rate was low - just a trickle. Hot water was luke-warm at best - no ""hot"" water. Shower drain was in the middle of a flat tiled shower floor sloping toward the back end of the shower where water puddled up and did not drain, leaving soap scum, etc. - very unsanitary. Bathroom sink did not drain well, leaving shaving cream, soap scum, whiskers in sink after shaving by the time it drained - and the drain had a ""sewer"" smell. There were unrepaired holes in the drywall at the bathroom door jamb. I put clothing into the dresser drawers and the drawers would not stay shut - annoying! Refrigerator made a loud humming noise - on and off about every 3-5 seconds. No continental breakfast included (unless you want to pay $9 to have it delivered to your room.) One evening, I decided to use the hot tub outside (because I was rather cold and knew I couldn't take a hot shower). The palm tree trimmers did not cover the hot tub that day, so they had dropped palm tree trimmings into the hot tub rendering it unusable. The pool cleaning company was there the next evening to clean it out."
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,3,Overnight stay on way to airport,"Had to catch a very early flight out of PHX, and this was the closest hotel we found. It actually was clean, comfortable and close to the airport enough."
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,3,"Okay, but needs maintenance","The hotel was apparently renovated about 10 or 15 years ago, but hasn't been very well maintained since then. The condition of the rooms is clean but run-down. The attached restaurant serves pretty decent Indian food. The biggest complaint is that there was a plumbing issue with the hot water not running in the shower. The second is that the check in process was excruciatingly slow. I don't know if I'd stay there again, given the plethora of other inexpensive hotels in the area. If you do stay there, check all of the amenities in the room and insist on a different room if something doesn't work."
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,3,Decent Hotel,Hotel was in decent shape and clean.  Bathrooms were very nice and redone but rest of room looked fine.  Main floor smelled of cat litter in some places and some others smelled like cleaning supplies.  Desk staff messed up my room keys when I checked in so I had to go all the way back to lobby to get it fixed.  Staff was friendly and apologized though.  Check out was smooth and easy.
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,4,Great place,I like it
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,5,Awesome customer service great rooms,"Front desk staff was awesome. David was amazing, he was exceptional in providing quality customer service. Whenever we had a need, he was quick to assist and resolve. Housekeeping was excellent and maintenance too as they had to repair a socket. 5 stars!"
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,3,"Good hotel, some issues.","Stayed for Baseball Spring Training @ 140 CAD., the free WIFI is a total Joke, no reception at all in the room and very limited in lobby and kept logging off, we have 4 devices so I know it was not the device. I asked if I can pay for wifi to get better reception, was told that's all they offer.The pool has problems as it's leaking all over the place outside, twice there and no towels, when asked for towel, they only brought 2 towels. If you don't get the room service by 10 am, they won't come back.Room was clean but little small for 4 people."
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,3,Close to highway,"We stayed at this hotel on a Saturday night. The highway is quite close and is quite noisy. Upon entering the room it was clean and smelled good. Our neighbors however were very noisy and rowdy at 1 am and I had not been able to sleep because of all the noise,so I picked up the in room phone and called the front desk......6 times!! No answer. I then used my cell phone to call the front desk directly and they immediately picked up! I was quite upset at this point. They said they would send security to check on the noisy room. Security eventually showed up, and knocked on the wrong room! Needless to say I had to call back and finally persuaded them to switch me to a different room. So at around 2 am, there we are getting all of our stuff packed up again to switch rooms, as soon as we enter the next room, I walk up to the window and find a drone right in front of it peering in! NEVER RETURNING to this hotel, slept maybe 2 hours the whole night"
Holiday Inn North Phoenix,5,great hotel,"I stay here frequently as a getaway. It is clean, quiet for the most part. They do allow dogs so just make sure there is not a dog in the room next door. However they did take care of the barking dog next door immediately and it stopped for the rest of the night. That only happened once in all my stays.It still looks brand new on the inside. Highly recommend this hotel."
Comfort Inn I-10 West at 51st Ave,4,Close to freeway.,Great shower! 24' gym is nice.rooms a little dated.
Comfort Inn I-10 West at 51st Ave,3,"Nice rooms, but........","We had a great time, day one at spring training, only to come back to our hotel which has been taken over by NASCAR people!! Now don't get me wrong, I love Nascar BUT..they took over the parking lot. We counted 30 trucks each of them taking up 3 spaces!!! We had to park down the street at another hotel.... More"

Red Roof Inn Phoenix North - Bell Road,1,Horrible,Horrible neighborhood and rooms were unclean
Red Roof Inn Phoenix North - Bell Road,3,A bit overpriced for no breakfast,"Didn't clean our room one day for no reason, left early and came back late."
Red Roof Inn Phoenix North - Bell Road,3,Red Rooof,"The only thing about the Red Roof inn is its in the corner and it's tucked away from everything... so for me who didn't have a vehicle it's kind of difficult navigate to like the store and things like that I mean, but there are few places within walking distance..."
Hotel 502,2,"Very shabby, not very chic","I expect VERY little from a hotel. I'm cheap by nature, and I really only want a door that locks and a shower that's hot. However, Hotel 502 made me rethink my low expectations and future travel plans. The front desk clerks ARE friendly and responsive, BUT, the rooms are very shabby and barely clean ('down there' hair on toilet seat, permanent mystery stain on sheets), the shower was cold/lukewarm (at best) and the neighborhood is less than desirable--LOTS of transients and sketchy folks wandering on property. I only paid 62 (+tax) per night, but if I had paid more I would have been really angry. As I said earlier, I really only want a locking door and hot shower (for 60+ I don't expect much). I can overlook the worn down rooms (I was told our room was renovated, but my mother stayed here when it was formally the Red Roof Inn, and said it looked the same, save a new t.v., and a different paint color on the bathroom wall). I can overlook the fact that a storm knocked out their WiFi and the pool was closed. I can overlook the people passed out drunk in their cars, and the less than clean room/bath. But NO hot shower Not good--even for 62 and some change. The only plus was the friendly front desk clerk--she gets kudos."
Hotel 502,3,"Nice facilities, bad rooms. But clean","The hotel was clean and neat. Staff was friendly. But it looks like a work in progress. The floors were basic concrete with no tile or carpet, the room only came with a small rug. The toilet was clean but didn't work too good. The fan in the restroom was very loud and about to fall apart because of some missing screws. The hot water took a very very long time to start coming out. And lastly, there was a big water leak in the last day that came from the ceiling in the restroom. We woke up to find a soaked floor and soaked toilet. Breakfast was good and the lobby was really nice. The pool area and the whole outside was nice as well. Now they just need to fix the rooms so they can match the rest of the hotel. I wouldn't stay there again only if I knew the rooms have had good work put into it."
Hotel 502,5,great spot!!+,we love this place. the staff is always very accomodating and the rooms are super cute. the remodeled rooms are our favorite but the other rooms are nice too. great place for the price.
Hotel 502,5,The best stay ever,"I love the front desk an the manager an the maintenance it was good which is why I was there in the first place because of the plumbing in my apartment i enjoyed the pool the colored lights was nice .Hello Faith, Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel 502. We are happy that you enjoyed your stay. Take care and hope to see you again in the near future."
Hotel 502,3,Probably won't be back,"While making coffee one morning and trying to iron a shirt, the circuit tripped. The sad part was that the GFI was at the END of the electrical run, not the beginning, so I had to call down to the front desk and wait for someone to reset the circuit at the electrical panel. I shouldn't have blown in the first place, but it also should be re-wired properly."
Hotel 502,2,Not Good,There was much to be desired. Air cond. didn't work well. No cups in bathroom. The housekeeping employees woke us up. we were not ready to get up before 8 A.M.
Hotel 502,1,"Sucks, Nosy Staff",Horrible
Hotel 502,5,this was great,"it was great to have a nice big pool, i love the outside area and the patch of grass thats in there, o and have a breakfast thats way better then anything i can imagine thanks so much hope to book again,"
The Nolitan Hotel,5,Best Value For Money In Lower Manhattan with a Warm Environment,"It's been my 12th-time stay at The Nolitan Hotel, of which I call home away from home. Here is why I keep coming back: 1. The staff is lovely, service oriented and overall great! 2. The rooms are clean, new and made by the best materials and in the exact size, you need for a short stay in the city. 3. The location is by far the best in terms of distance from subway, best stores (Ayr, KOIO, Outdoor Voices, DryBar) Restaurants (Mikakus Sushi, SweetGreens and Jacks Wife Freda)4. By far my favorite hotel in the city!Thank you Daniel for the review! As always we love to host you at the Nolitan! Let us know when you will be back )Best Regards."
Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Downtown,5,My Stay,Our first family reunion in Atl I was very happy with staff professionalism and friendliness to help with suggests. One family had a room problem and it was handled in a timely matter. I would recommend this hotel
Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Downtown,5,Wonderful hotel!,This is a very clean hotel. The staff is always very friendly and extremely helpful!

Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Downtown,5,Business,Highly recommend this hotel for the proximity to downtown Atlanta. Excellent room with very good daily service. The water pressure in the shower was outstanding. Not something you find in lower quality hotels.
Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Downtown,2,Dissatisfying for the dollar charged,"We arrived at the hotel feeling positive about the location and warm-ish greeting at reception. This feeling did not last long. The pillows were really uncomfortable, both of the taps were hot, the AC was so loud and made a buzzing noise (we asked twice to have this fixed and nothing changed), the fire alarm went off at 3am and there was never really an excuse given as to what was going on, then (because we'd had no sleep) we put the 'do not disturb' sign on and the cleaner banged on our door repeatedly shouting 'housekeeping' until we answered. The water was shut off one evening from 11pm-3am which meant that when we had to go to the toilet it sat there for hours. No one informed us where a smoking area was so we assumed there was not one... this meant that we smoked out the front and got disturbed, bugged and pushed by homeless people asking for money, cigerettes, etc. It really was just one thing after the other. The cups were so rubbish that they leaked, my oartner hit his head on the shower because of a stupid bar across the top and they charged 50 dollars a night for a hold This was not really made clear at the beginning and I was left wondering why I was missing so much from my account. I have stayed in many hotels, hostels, bnbs over the years and had just stayed in 4 other places, all were LESS money and gave a better, quality experience."
Hilton Garden Inn Atlanta Downtown,4,Great location,"I was a little worried after reading some of the reviews talking about rooms that were dirty or need to be updated, but we found our room to be clean and without any problems.

"The Beekman, A Thompson Hotel",5,Great stay with minor items,"Overall this is a great property. The lobby, restaurant, and hotel rooms are really well done. Lots of nice touches with great designs. Tons of character here. We stayed in a double queen room which we thought had plenty of space. The gym is located between two floors and has a Peloton bike and the hotel provides the shoes. As a cycling, I thought this was awesome. I already had a Peloton login. The music in the gym, however, was too loud and we called to have it turned down and the staff couldn't figure out how to do it. The staff were all friendly and courteous - bellhops, front desk staff and concierge all included. Location very convenient to a number of places downtown. Beds and pillows were comfortable. TVs changed channels without the annoying 1 second delay at most other hotels. There's some construction going on at the property next door to be aware of, but it's New York and good luck finding somewhere without construction. Definitely recommend.Dear chitripguy, Thank you very much for your detailed and wonderful review. I am so glad you enjoyed our property from our comfortable rooms and the gym.

Quality Inn & Suites,1,Bad enough to not want to stay in any Quality brand hotel again,"We travel to Six Flags over GA pretty frequently. This was our first and last time for staying at this hotel. I'm generally a 4-5 star reviewer of hotels, with the occasional 3 star, here and on Trip Advisor, but this was my worst experience. There are plenty of problems with this place, but I'll start with the pros:Pro: Location to 6 Flags and room comfort. Both of these and parking were fine.Cons: It is not an overstatement to say this was the worst check in experience I've ever had, and not one interaction with staff the rest of the stay would change that. From walking into the hotel to check-in to finally walking into my room was probably 45-60 minutes, and when you are traveling with family, it's late at night, and you have to get up early, that's 45 minutes you can use. I walked in to the hotel, and I was probably 3rd or 4th to check in, and the line never moved as it took them forever to resolve what appeared to be simple problems. I don't know what the other customer issues were, but they weren't the problems. By the time I got there, I could see why it took a long time. A routine check in with reservations took longer here then anywhere else. When I did finally get my room keys, I go up to room with family who have been waiting WAY TOO LONG, and the keys don't work (and yes, I've stayed in enough hotels to know how to use hotel key cards). So after trying for several minutes, I go back down to front desk, wait in line for about 5 more minutes for the two workers to take care of routine check ins, and have the worker re key the cards again (and this time I watched to make sure he did them, and they did work when I returned to room).In my room, I check the safe, and on the safe it has the note about if you don't want to be billed for not using the safe, tell front desk on check out. So the next morning, I tell front desk we didn't use the safe, and yet, he still put it on my bill and would not remove.And this is why I think it is a Quality Brand issue. They aren't checking on their hotels at all. This comment has been made repeatedly on this website and the Choice Hotels website, but it is a problem.On the 3rd floor, the elevator has only 1 button, since you can only go down, but the arrow points up (little thing that make no difference on my stay, but demonstrate lack of care). The privacy door latch was put up backwards, so that it couldn't do anything to keep someone from opening the door. These lack of attention to details isn't a big thing by themselves, but the accumulation of them is a general sloppiness in maintenance that is apparent.Dear Guest. I would like to personally apologize for the series of unfortunate incidences that you experienced during your stay with us. We continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail. I will look into each issue that you have noted, in an attempt to correct and improve our hotel policies. Sincerely, Hotel Manager"

The location was great having easy access to 285, restaurants/shops close by and the MARTA station is just a short drive away. We will defiantly stay here again."
Hampton Inn Atlanta-Perimeter Center,3,Ok,"Linens were dingy, took a while to locate my Reservation although I booked it through the hotel. The housekeeping staff was pleasant. Located in a central area. Overall it was ok confusing though it's situated next to 2 other hotels and a condominium"
Extended Stay America - Atlanta - Clairmont,5,Awesome Staff,"Swiftly cleaned rooms just like most hotels. The staff are the best part about staying here. Shawn and Bianca N. are my favorites.

Extended Stay America - Atlanta - Clairmont,5,Four night stay,Entire staff was both accommodating and extreemly pleasant. Room was very clean and quiet. I recommend this hotel and plan to stay there when I visit Atlanta later in the new year.

Extended Stay America - Atlanta - Clairmont,4,Rita Tavares Eight nights stay for job relocation,"I needed a place away from the airport noise and chose this hotel. The small kitchen with refrigerator is very convenient for someone like me that likes to save some money on food. The room was clean and the employees super nice. I recommend anyone to stay here!We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience and for choosing to stay with us. I'm so pleased to hear that you valued the fully equipped kitchen in your room, the cleanliness of your room, and your overall stay at our hotel. The staff and I would like to thank you again for posting your review. We look forward to welcoming you back in the future!"
The Redbury New York,3,Average at best,"To be fair I went into this hotel with high expectations based off of multiple stays at the Redbury in LA. Its my go to in LA because of how amazing it is - it is my third or fourth hotel in the US hands down. The Redbury NYC doesnt compare. The hotel itself a little unkempt. Not in a trendy vintage way but in a needs some TLC way. We stayed in a deluxe double, the beds are really small, view was bleh, and there was a lot of construction across the street so it was noisy on our side early in the morning (not the fault of the hotel obviously) I can handle all the above and it wouldnt have been an issue however the service is what was so disappointing to me. The bellhop (if you can call him that) was rude and mumbled things under his breath after I asked for help to get luggage to the room. Note: I had to ask - when I was clearly walking in with two daughters and luggage. We called to the front to ask for cutlery, they said they would check and see if they had any and bring it up twenty minutes later my husband had to go and get it. We never heard from them. No one was overly friendly with the exception of two staff one being the housekeeper who was cleaning the rooms on the 6th floor when we checked in. She had great energy and went out of her way to ask what we needed and if she could help in any way. And the second was a gentleman who answered the concierge call when we had a few questions about parking. Outside of that this hotel really needs to step up there customer service game. See also my review of Marta. Same theme, very flat, non- engaging staff. Delicious pizza though. So its almost like you have a great product but your front line isnt selling it. Overall average which is disappointing for this brand. Thank you for sharing your feedback, Domenica.We regret that your experience with us was less than ideal. We're disappointed to hear the service you received wasn't up to par. Providing our guests with exceptional service is something we take seriously. Please know this will be addressed with the appropriate members of our team so we may improve for the future.We hope you'll give us another chance to show you the service we're truly capable of providing."
The Redbury New York,2,What a Disappointment,"The photo's looked fantastic. Our room however was not. The, a/c in the room was sellotaped into the window and was so noisy we couldn't sleep. Rooms were small. View was invisible due to the filthy windows and construction work opposite. The shower leaked and flooded the bathroom. The sink had no plug. No table or chest of drawers or anything in the room. This is in my opinion is scraping a 3 star if that definitely not a 4.We appreciate the feedback, Russell.We're disappointed that your stay with us was less than ideal. It's unfortunate you've noticed a decline in the quality of our accommodations, and that you had such challenges with your room. We care about the comfort of our guests so we'll address your concerns with our team moving forward.We hope for the opportunity to host you again soon for a more positive experience."
Silver Cloud Inn - Seattle Lake Union,1,July 4th weekend,"We stayed in a King Suite for 4 nights over the July 4th weekend. I can hardly express how good and positive our stay was. Breakfast was very good. The staff was always attentive and kind and helpful. We had difficulty with a flat screen in the bedroom and as we were stepping out for a few hours on Sunday,... More"
Silver Cloud Inn - Seattle Lake Union,5,24 hour pool,We recently stayed at the Silver Cloud Inn to go to the Maroon 5 concert and were very pleasantly surprised. Staff was very friendly and helpful. They have a complimentary shuttle bus to take you to the tourist spots. The best was the pool which is opened 24 hours! We did a day of sightseeing and then relaxed and had... More
Residence Inn Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,3,"Loved the Breakfast, Not Much Else","Great breakfast buffet each morning. Definitely adds value to the price. But otherwise, not a great stay. I think their cleaning crew must be understaffed. One day they didn't take out our trash or give us bath rugs or hand towels. The six of us in a two bedroom suite shared towels and used a washcloth -- a washcloth! -- for a rug. The next day we didn't get any maid service at all! At 6:00 pm, we went downstairs and asked for our own towels. The little market store downstairs was sold out of bottled water for two of our five day stay. Not having water after a long day of city walking was a real disappointment. And there is no easy market or store within walking distance, so we were chugging tap water. Yuck. My son got sick one night, so we hoped for ginger ale or Sprite or something to settle his stomach. Nope. All they had was Mountain Dew.The location across from Lake Union was pretty, but not convenient for downtown activities. We had to wait up to 20 minutes for an Uber driver during peak hours. That was poor planning on my part to book here, but I had no idea that Uber would be so difficult. Despite the challenges, we did have a decent stay. Our two room suite was spacious and comfortable. And again, the breakfast was really fantastic.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your recent stay with us and providing your honest feedback. On behalf of our team, I apologize we fell short of meeting our expectations but most importantly yours. It is guest as yourself who help improve our hotel and provide better service in the future. I apologize for the inconvenience of your downtown travels in Seattle. However, I am glad you were comfortable in our luxurious two-bedroom suite. Respectfully,"
Inn at El Gaucho,5,Lovely boutique hotel,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights in April, coming from Victoria on the Clipper. The hotel was very conveniently located, just four blocks from the ferry terminal. We were met by Lee, who was very courteous, and very helpful with suggestions and directions for sightseeing and restaurants. The room was very nice, and very quiet. We enjoyed happy hour in the lobby, and we had one dinner in the restaurant downstairs. The ambience is very retro. The front-desk and cleaning staff were wonderful. We could do all of the sightseeing we wanted on foot. Chihuly Garden and Glass was a highlight. Highly recommended.Dear Guest,Thank you for this fantastic review! Our location really is ideal for 'on-foot' sightseeing of the Chihuly Museum/Space Needle as well the Pike Place Market. Nice when we are perfectly placed in the middle of these two iconic spots! Your kudos for Lee are so appreciated as well. We pride ourselves on making guests feel as if they've traveled to a home away from home, so it would be our greatest honor to welcome you back as our guests again in the future. Please feel free to reach out to me directly when you consider your next trip to Seattle :)Best Regards,David Bayley"
Inn at El Gaucho,5,"Quirky, lovely hotel. Glad we booked there.","Location great. Walking distance to everything we wanted to see. Room great. Staff very helpful. Lee, the lovely lady who first saw us when we booked in couldn't have been more helpful. She gave us lots of information about Seattle and was extremely friendly and helpful. Lee went above and beyond in customer service."
Inn at El Gaucho,5,Awesome hotel awesome location !!,"We stayed for 1 night for the Pearl Jam show , great friendly staff , all the amenities you need , cool retro rooms.Awesome location, a short stroll to Pike Place Market.Will stay again on our next trip to Seattle for sure !!Hey Harry!Thanks SO SO much for the great review. It was a pleasure having the two of you stay with us and getting to chat Pearl Jam and old Seattle rock. It would be great to see you two down from BC again soon!Cheers until then,David Bayley"
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,3,"Friendly staff, nice room, decent breakfast but hallway carpet and keylock issue - needs maintenance","This hotel is conveniently located off 1-10 but for the price we were a bit disappointed. The carpet in the hallway on our floor was very wrinkled, needs to be restretched or replaced and we had a lot of trouble getting our door open as the keylock was rickety and had a sort of personality of its own you had to lean on the door at the same time as putting the keycard in the slot. There was a lot of noise from someone in the room above us, walking or jumping on the floor which of course was our ceiling. It went on for a long time and made it so my mom couldn't sleep so I called the front desk to complain. The front desk clerk must have called them so it stopped for a good while, happened again briefly and then stopped for the night. The breakfast was good, pretty standard for La Quinta and I liked that they had Mexican salsa, fried potatoes and good sized disposable paper coffee cups. I don't like the weird industrial type scrambled eggs at this and other La Quintas because they don't even seem like real eggs at all, more like some liquid egg heated in a microwave. They have little flavor and the texture leaves a lot to be desired. Wish they were real, freshly cooked eggs and that someone in top management at La Quinta headquarters would pay attention and improve that. That would definitely improve my opinion of their breakfasts!Dear Traveler,Thank you for choosing our property for your traveling needs. We are working on plans to renovate the hotel this year. It is our hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely, Vickie W."
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,3,Good location,"My daughter and I stay here on our way to California. Our was nice, our room was clean and very pleasant. The location of the hotel was very close to I-10. However as the night progress and more guest arrived, we could hear footsteps above us as the guest walked around. Also we had a non-smoking room, but we could smell cigarette smoke from our restroom."
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,4,Great value!!!,"We enjoyed a great stay at La Quinta and would stay here again for the value and proximity to the fwy! Overall, a great value for the price!! Good sized guestroom and bathroom. It was clean and quiet. And we enjoyed the variety of breakfast item's that were served buffet style!!"
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,5,Great Night Stay,"We really enjoyed our overnight stay here. The bed was comfortable. It was clean and quiet. The location is nice and close to the freeway with a lot of food choices close by. We were able to bring our dog, too! Recommended."
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,5,Awesome experience,We had 4 rms for family reunion. Our stay was a great experience. All our family needs and requests were met and service exceeded our expectations. The rms were clean and restful. The kids had a balst in the pool and breakfast exceeded our needs. Great job tonthe intire staff in Arizona
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,5,Outstanding Service,The 2 room suite was great and the overall service was outstanding. The price of the suite was very reasonable. The provided Breakfast was great and the front desk personnel were outstanding. We could not have asked for better service. We will stay there on all of our trips to Phoenix.
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,4,A Really Great Stay!,"This is a nice hotel in a good location close to some shopping and several food options. Because of its setup, it is pretty quiet at night which is nice considering it's on a main drag. The woman at the main desk was very pleasant and got us checked in quickly with no wait. It was around 8:00pm when we got there.The room was spacious and clean which is always appreciated especially at a reasonable price. My only complaint was that the ice machine on our floor was broken and most of the drink selections were empty so we had to go back down to the main floor to find what we were looking for.The breakfast was decent for the price we paid. There was fruit, yogurt, eggs, cereal, juice, bagels and waffles. The standard spread that one would expect. The food was continually stocked which was nice. My only complaint was the seating was very limited. There was not enough room for the amount of people showing up to breakfast, so we and a couple other groups had to stand for a while until someone offered us a seat.There also is a pool at this hotel which looked nice, but unfortunately, I didnt get to try it out. But from the looks of the people out on the patio, people loved it and it looked very well kept.I would definitely stay here again!"
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,4,"Great room, reasonable price","I was very pleased with my room here. The bed was comfortable. The hotel was quiet and well maintained. The complimentary breakfast was good, and the seating area was spacious and clean. I found the bed comfortable. Parking area was spacious. Close to the airport. Great value for the cost."
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,5,GREAT STAY,"We checked in late on Friday night. The desk clerk was very friendly and quick to help us get checked in. The only issue wass when we went to get in the room. You could only turn the handle upward to open the door. We met Alicia, manager at the front desk. the next morning. She was very informative of the surrounding area and helped us get around to places that we wanted to go to. The bathroom and whole room was very clean and pleasant. The whole staff were friendly professional. This will be my hotel of choice when I come to the Phoenix area. Thanks to Alicia and all the staff for helping in making it a great weekend stay."
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,5,Great Staff-Excellent Value,"Front desk/service personnel were very friendly, room was very clean, AC unit worked very well and breakfast was one of the best of all the La Quinta's I have stayed. Highway 10 access is fast and several gas stations plus fast food restaurants are within 1/4 mile."
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,3,Quick trip from Oregon,"Hotel is undergoing renovation and lots is construction personnel inside the hotel. The carpet in the hallway was very tired from all of the foot and wheel barrow traffic. Im sure hoping that it will be replaced as part of the renovation. My stay was satisfactory, but couldve been nicer without all the work going on."
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,5,Hotel Stay,I stay at this hotel for 2 weeks. And the staff was always very up beat and friendly and always ready to help. The Hotel was clean inside and out. There was always fresh cookie at the front desk along with a smile on the stuff person no matter who the person was behind the counter.
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,5,Good place to stay,The staff made it a very enjoyable stay. After check in the front desk clerk made fresh cookies and lemonade. The rooms were very clean and fresh smelling. The breakfast was very good and fresh. Will stay on our return trip.
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,4,Business Trip,Fine place to stay. Close to freeway with easy on/off access. Breakfast was what was to be expected at a LQ Inn and Suites. Internet connection was lacking. Would stay here again if in this area of Phoenix.
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,4,Very welcoming staff,"Stayed three nights on the way back to Phoenix Airport at the end of our holiday.The rooms were roomy clean but three light fittings didn't work, and neither did the TV remote.The pool was closed for one day when an underwater light fitting loosened and floated to the top of the water with electrical cables attached to the mains!!When visiting the breakfast area at 9.20am one morning, vitually nothing was left and it wasn't replenished. We had cereal and toast and that was it!!The redeeming feature at this hotel was Anthony on front desk. He was extremely welcoming, friendly and made us feel at home. I would stay there again because of the service given to us by him."
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,4,"Friendly staff, dog friendly, super comfy beds","We stayed here in the heat of summer with our dog. While there isn't a huge dog area outside, walking down the business park street behind the hotel provided enough space for our dog to unwind from a long car ride. On leash. Breakfast was standard, hard boiled eggs, waffles, yogurt, cereal, etc.. good coffee. The staff was just awesome in the friendly department. And 2 steak houses are within 3 miles, and super cheap gas at Circle K is close as well."
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,5,loved it here,my experience here at la quinta was amazing when i visited pheonix. i recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious stay at an affordable price. their services were great and so was the scenery and other things about th eroom and hotel.
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,3,"Good stay, decent breakfast","We checked into this hotel on Saturday for one night. Check in was smooth and easy. We asked for a first floor room when we reserved. They only had an ADA room left which was fine with us. We travel with a lab and first floor is easier for her. The hotel was quite pet friendly but the dog walking area was limited and there was no bag and disposal station. The location is convenient and right off I10. The area is a little run down but I not to the point of feeling any safety issues. The room was comfortable and clean with the usual amenities. The air conditioner was hard to get on the right temperature. The was no wall temperature setting so you had to adjust it at the unit which was an older knob type. It took quite a while before we were not frozen out (which is better than the alternative in Phoenix). The hallway carpet was getting a little worn and could stand to be replaced. On to the breakfast. This was a pleasant surprise as it was better thsn the typical La Quinta breakfast. First of all there was real coffe, not an instant machine. There was also sausage links and multiple berry toppings for the waffles and whipped cream. I usually don't eat these things for breakfast but since they had them it was a nice treat. The cinnamon toast also looked inviting.Overall a good stay for one night. Given the lack of other things to do at that location I would not consider it for an extended stay."
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,1,Worst of all La Quinta hotels that we have stayed in.,"This was the dirtiest and least appealing of all La Quintas that we have stayed in. The main floor hallway carpets were dirty and actually starting to lift in places. The room had old and ripped furniture and looked worn out. A simple thing like a bed skirt looked stained and very old. This hotel needs a complete Reno from exterior to interior including the grounds around the hotel. The surrounding area looked unsafe and gave us a feeling never to walk around at night. There were no family restaurants in the area.Mal,I'm so sorry that your experience did not live up to expectations. We never want our guests feeling unsatisfied or unsafe. I will make sure and forward your comments on to the general manager to make sure that this remains an isolated incident.Sincerely,La Quinta Customer Care Team"

La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,5,We had my 3 legged dogs with us and they accommodated us to be near a door on the first floor,This is a nice LaQuinta hotel. We came back from Bearazona wildlife park after going there with our dogs Timmy and Peanut. They were so understanding about getting us a room as close to a door on the first floor as possible. The rooms are clean with a fridge and a microwave in it. We are booked in February again for our road trip back to Las Angeles.
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,4,Nice and New,"We booked this particular La Quinta because its location off I-10 was convenient for our long roadtrip. Great price on hotel website, and room was new and clean. My son liked the pool, and it was nice to have complementary waffles and fruit for breakfast. Staff were friendly and helpful. There were a couple of shady characters hanging around outside, but we never felt unsafe. I have a feeling this area might not be the best part of town."
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,3,Just OK,"Hotel has a smell.. Business office computers were not working and there was water dripping in the business office. Staff were friendly. Room was clean. Lighting in room could have been better.. I usually stay at hilton brand hotels, but all were sold out, or over 250, so I selected the la quinta.Dear Traveler, Thank you for choosing our property for your travel needs.

La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,3,Overall good,"Room was clean, price was reasonable, reception staff weren't overly friendly but were pleasant, maid service staff were very friendly.

Possibly would stay here again- it served its purpose for this trip.Dear Traveler, Thank you for staying with us and posting a review. We enjoyed having you as our guest. I am happy to hear that the housekeeping was friendly. Housekeeping really enjoys meeting our and guests and providing them with a clean room. We hope you will come back and see us again. Sincerely, Vickie W."
La Quinta Inn & Suites Phoenix I-10 West,3,Under construction,"Be aware that this hotel is currently being renovated. My room itself was OK, though the bathroom didnt seem like the renovation was finished. Poorly installed sockets and a cracked shower unit. The peephole on the door wasnt complete and had a Kleenex stuffed in it. I assume the construction also affected the breakfast, which was way below the style I expect at a La Quinta. Rate was too high for the level of room and breakfast provided. Dear Traveler, Thank you for taking the time to post a review on behalf of your stay with. We apologize that some of the renovations were taking place during your stay. It is through your feedback that we are able to improve what we do. It is our hope you will come back and see us again.

Residence Inn Phoenix North/Happy Valley,4,Awesome Place for its Price in Summer,"This Residence Inn is kind of out of no where - it's pretty far from the center of city and has lots developments in the area. That being said, there are good restaurants/coffeeshops around within 3-5 mins drive. Their price for the room in summer is GREAT! Not sure if I would pay for what they ask for in spring though.Dear Jui-Yu C,Thank you for choosing the Residence Inn Phoenix North/Happy Valley for your recent travels to Phoenix. Commitment to service and guest satisfaction is a main focus and we are delighted to hear you enjoyed your stay. The pride and dedication our hotel team takes in providing exceptional customer service to our valued guests speaks strongly to our companys core values, good service at a fair price.Thank you again for taking the time to provide your feedback and we look forward to serving you again soon!"
Courtyard Phoenix North/Happy Valley,4,Nice room and surroundings,"I had to attend a meeting here and decided to stay the night. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant. Nice pool andJacuzzi. Coffee shop also served Starbucks coffee but had their own sandwiches which were really good and worth the price. Most of the other guests there also had breakfast there rather than in the nearby mall and were happy with their orders as well. The mall is also quite near, walking distance with a wide selection of food."
"The Carlyle, A Rosewood Hotel",1,Tired old hotel,"I had a surprisingly disappointing stay at what I thought was supposed to be a nice hotel. We were moving apartments close by, and I booked a 3 night stay. The service was almost non-existent. We asked for a crib before check-in, then again three separate times after we checked in. It finally arrived after 11 PM! We asked for silverware so that we could eat our room service. Never brought it. We ended up eating with coffee stirrers in the room. No one offered a smile or hello, or offered to open a door when I was coming through with a stroller. The rooms are very dated. Overall, just a very disappointing stay. It seems like this hotel is just resting on a famous name.Dear LK198200,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback. While we wish you had a better experience, it is feedback like this that we learn from and use to improve. We work hard to deliver an exceptional guest experience, and it's apparent in this case that we fell short. It is important to us to do what we can to make amends for your stay. If you would like to further discuss your visit, please don't hesitate to reach out to our Hotel Manager, Massimiliano Puglisi, directly at Massimiliano.PuglisiRosewoodhotels.com.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Metropolitan - New York City,5,Fab location good customer service.,"We arrived at the beginning of July for a 7 night stay. Check in was quick staff friendly. We were upgraded to a room with a kingsize bed given free wifi on the 11th floor.Throughout our stay our room was kept spotless with fresh towels and shampoos etc refilled on a daily basis. On our last day we were able to stay in our room until 13.00hrs at no extra charge then our suitcases stored by the staff for 1 per case.We asked about purchasing a jar of cookies to bring home but unfortunately they were not available until 17.00hrs, however seeing the disappointment on our faces Jessica went the extra mile spoke with management we were able to purchase two tins We also were given a few free ones to have on our journey home!We will definitely return to this hotel when we are next back in New York. Ideal location and close enough to be within a short walk of Times Square but away from the hustle bustle of all the crowds. Thank you to all the staff at this hotel.Thanks for sharing this lovely review, Kathryn!We're thrilled to hear you enjoyed your stay with us at our prime location to Times Square.

FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,Amazing,"This Hotel was amazing. My husband and I came here for one night to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary. The staff was very accommodating and let us check in early. Andrew the front desk guy was awesome and sent us a bottle of champagne after I told him why we were here. The room was nice and spacious and the shower is on another level. There are lots of restaurants near by and places to walk to. The light rail is right next to the hotel so it was super easy to get to the restaurants and bars further downtown. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Andrew for making our stay amazing!Hello Amanda D, We thought you were pretty amazing too! I'll definitely share your accolades with the rest of the team. We hope you can try our restaurant, MATCH Restaurant and Lounge next time you stay. We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!"
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,Best Get Away,"I wanted to surpirse my boyfriend by not having to go home after picking him up from the airport and everything about the hotel was PERFECT. The location and hotel didn't feel like we were in Phoenix, and we live here!We're so happy to hear you had a wonderful time! Please visit again soon."
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,Trendy hotel DT Phoenix,We had a great stay at The Foundre while in town for a concert. Everything about this hotel was hip right down to the buttons in the elevators. The art was awesome...the Burt Reynolds painting still continues to make me laugh. Be sure to check out the artwork of Phoenix made out of recycled security envelopes and checks...so cool! The room had an industrial-style and were uber-clean. Beds were comfy. Located right next to the lightrail it is an easy ride to the center of downtown Phoenix. Oh and the staff was friendly and helpful!Wow! Thank you so much for this awesome review! We're so happy to hear you had a great stay and loved the hotel. Hope you will visit again soon.
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,"Cool, comfortable, clean","Industrial vibe, very new. Comfortable rooms. Fair value. Good location. Other food and coffee options in walkable distance. Ate breakfast onsite two mornings -- the menu is diverse and creative with good prices.Thank you Joel! We're happy to hear you had a great stay. We hope to welcome you again in the future."
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,memorial day weekend trip,"this is a fantastic hotel, i think it is a hidden gem located in the arts district of Phoenix. It is a fairly new hotel, very different, in a good way, from your typical hotel. The grounds are spotless, plenty of fun places to eat all within walking distance. I would not say it is within walking distance in the middle of summer in Phoenix to Chase Field or Talking Stick Arena. But the light rail has a stop right in front of the hotel and with your game ticket it is a free ride or for 4 bucks per person you can ride the light rail anywhere all day. Valet parking, only option, is 25 per day but they were great. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Rooms are the best part, very industrial but super cool. Concrete floors with plenty of area rugs.Neat shower and here would be the only complaints. The room is very open, the bath room only has frosted glass between the bathroom and rest of the room. Light from the bath room floods the rest of the room, especially on night runs to the bathroom. And has at least one other has said, you hear ALL noises coming from the bathroom which can be embaressing. We were in room 709, top floor king room with balcony and had an inflatable bed which I slept on (25 per night) It was a south facing room and had a great view of the city. 100 percent recommend this hotel, plenty of art all around. Just a fun place, the hotel is a destination, just like a Disney HotelThank you so much! We're so happy to hear you had such a wonderful stay. Hope to see you again soon."
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,Great new boutique/art hotel in downtown Pheonix,"Brilliant design, great and thoughtful creative art. Service was the same. Creative bar menu, knowledgeable bartenders, especially Maxwell. Room- well designed, interesting design with iron industrial structures. Bathroom with double sided sink, large walk in shower is great. Loved the Bass Egg Bluetooth speaker was a surprise bonus. Try out Found:Re!Thank you Douglas for this amazing review! We're so happy to hear you had a great experience. We hope to see you again soon!"
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,Like Old Friends,"I have to say this hotel more than fit the bill for my five night stay in Phoenix. The valets were always very helpful and prompt (one of them was a hoot). The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Two of the ladies (one in the morning and one in the evening) always asked about my day and were impressed with everything I had been to see. My room was spacious and the bathroom was a bit strange in its layout (sink extends from outside into the shower area), but it grew on me. They gave me plenty of pillows and the bed was comfy My only issue is that the walls are a little thin (or it could have been the connecting doors), cause I could hear my neighbors very clearly a few times. The hotel is located right near US-10 and is in walking distance of the Phoenix Art Museum and the northern part of downtown. Sad to leave but overall a great stay.Hi jehenson81!Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I'll definitely share you accolades with the rest of the team. I know they'll be thrilled to hear your kind words. I'll also share your feedback about the rooms with connecting doors with our design team. Next time you book your reservation, please reach out to me at mrykalskyfoundrehotels.com and I'll make sure you are set-up in a room without a connecting room. We hope to see you again soon!Thanks!"
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,You have to stay in 809,"I stayed in 809, and it was an absolute blast. The view and overall feeling of the suite exactly what I needed. Treat yourself to it, and walk the hotel to view a ton of local art. It's everything I want in a downtown hotel. Beautiful design, comfy rooms, that wow factor, local focused, and friendly staff.Thank you so much for this awesome review! We hope you'll come back and stay with us again soon."
FOUND:RE Phoenix,4,"modern, hip hotel","I looked around quite a bit for a decent pet-friendly hotel, and this fit the bill nicely. Everyone is very nice and friendly. The hotel itself is very comfortable and nicely appointed. If you like modern hip vibe design, this is a good place to be. It's close to restaurants and the Japanese Friends Garden, a very large park next door (though not sure why they call it Japanese since nothing about it is Japanese). I only had drinks at the bar and chose to eat across the street at the Moroccan restaurant. The bartender was very knowledgeable and friendly. The only drawback about this hotel is the lack of sound proofing. My last morning (Saturday), I was woken very early by the person in the room next door with their music blaring. Also, the music from the bar is very, very loud, and there were several people hanging outside the lobby in front of their car with their music turned up so loud it was shaking the windows. My poor dog was so scared. Also, I was gone all day the first full day there, and came back at 830pm to find my room still had not been cleaned. Minor inconvenience.Hi! Thank you for taking the time to write a review! Glad to hear you and your pup had a comfortable stay. There are actually two parks next to us, and you were most likely in Hance Park, not the Japanese Friendship Garden as there is a fee and the grounds there are built and landscaped just as they are in Japan. Perhaps on your next stay we can get you pointed in the right direction. As far as the noise issues you experienced, we are already looking in to ways we can improve this. We apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused for you and your dog. We will also address the issue with your room to see why it hadn't been cleaned while you were away. Again, thanks for this review and we will use it to improve and hopefully see you again in the future."
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,Very impressed! I already want to come back!,"This was one of the most memorable hotels I've stayed at from it's eclectic and fun vibe to the gracious and friendly staff. We were greeted by Angel who was top notch at explaining the hotel re-image as well as was incredibly thorough on explaining the room we reserved, it's accommodations and the awesome tablet that is a connection has everything you'll need from room service to tourist information. I will be coming to Phoenix more often in the coming years and this hotel will be where I will be staying. The room was clean and gorgeous. We were taking pictures for the first few minutes of arriving because the set-up was so appealing and balcony view of downtown Phoenix was breathtaking. We stayed in the balcony king suite and for the price-point it was such a great value. I will be recommending this hotel to anyone visiting central Arizona. Thank you to the staff and management for making a quick one night trip so much fun. You all did a superb job at conveying what your ideology for a great hotel is. P.S. The amount of charging/usb charging ports you have around the room make a techy like me giddy. James! Thank you for making out day! We're so happy to hear you loved the hotel and enjoyed your stay. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience with us. We do hope you will come back and visit us again soon."
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,"Quirky, cool hotel","Our whole experience here was really positive. Rooms were clean, comfy and cosy with some fun artwork. Staff were friendly and accommodating. The food at the downstairs restaurant was delicious too and parking was really easy. Would thoroughly recommend.Thank you for this amazing review Melissa! We hope you will visit again soon."
FOUND:RE Phoenix,3,Interesting boutique hotel,"As Christian I found this hotel inappropriate because of what I think were sexually suggestive photos and art work. I would not recommend this hotel for families with children because of the photos and Artwork. Hi Delia, our intention is never to offend anyone. One of our values is community and in that we are inclusive of people of all walks of life. We curate all local art from local artists to support our local community but also to support different values and showcase different views from everyone. We certainly understand that not everyone will enjoy or understand the art, but we thank you for giving us a try. Just as any other contemporary museum, we showcase art that reflects the life and times of the artists we represent here as an art hotel. We do have families who stay here and enjoy it as a learning experience and we hope to continue to provide that for our guests and local community."
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,"Come for the Hotel, Stay for the Art","The Found:Re is a unique hotel is special city: part hotel, part Art gallery, this is one fun place to stay. My wife and I love it for it's ever changing, with new works of Art installed regularly. The property is centrally located, features a nice restaurant, Match, and is just across the street from FEZ, one of favorite eateries outside the hotel proper. The Found:Re is also a short walk from the Phoenix Art Museum, which is on par with some of the best in San Francisco, Denver, Chicago, and New York.We appreciate the kind words! We look forward to seeing you again!"
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,Amazing Cool Hotel,"This hotel is a hip, slick, cool hotel and a great price! Exposed pipes and beams, funky lights, great walk in shower with a shower and mirror in the shower! The food is locally sourced and fabulous! Artwork everywhere in the hotel. Close to downtown and light rail from the airport takes you right to the front door - stay here!!!We're so happy to hear you had a great stay! Come back soon."
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,Absolutely Wonderful,"My wife and I loved this hotel. Our large room was beautifully decorated...with a super comfortable bed. The ambiance of the hotel I would describe as urban chic boutique-style luxury art gallery hotel. The location is wonderful for exploring the charming neighborhood and nearby downtown. The service was excellent. Brunch was delicious in the charming restaurant. Bottom line - it combines a fun, happening atmosphere with a great stay. I doubt we'd look anywhere else in the future. This is the hotel of choice.Hi Doug K,Thank you for your kind words! We think you're pretty great too! We hope to see you again soon.Thanks!"
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,Modern Accomodations,"I used to live in Phoenix and I recently moved away. I love this area because of the restaurants and places to drink. I stayed here for a wedding that was at the Phoenix Art Museum and couldn't be happier with my stay. The hotel is very open and has a modern feel. The bar and restaurant are has covered outdoor seating if you want to enjoy some rays while enjoying a bite to eat. The Vietnamese Iced coffee drink was my favorite at the bar. The pool was on the smaller size and there weren't that many loungers to lay on, but there was good sun and good tunes. The studio room was modern, had a ton of towels, 2 bathrobes, and 2 slippers. The room is what I would want in a studio apartment with a comfy bed, a place to sit and drink coffee, and a desk for doing office-y type stuff. I don't like putting my clothes in drawers, so it wasn't a problem for me that there weren't any drawers or cabinets. A lot of places to hang your suits/dresses if you're in town for business or a wedding. Thank you so much for this awesome review. We hope you will choose us again when you make it back it to Phoenix."
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,Unique and Inviting,Fantastic place to stay! Unique environment combined with excellent service to make the perfect location to stay. There was a level of service here that I have not experienced anywhere else in Phoenix. I will definitely return and recommend to other travelers.Thank you so much! We're happy to hear you had a great stay!
FOUND:RE Phoenix,4,New Hotel in Phoenix,"The Found:RE is a great new hotel in Phoenix. My co-worker and I had such a good experience there. It was a perfect location. Staff were amazing, and very helpful. Even though they were still renovating certain areas (hotel has only been open for 2 weeks) it was an all around great place to stay. Thank you for your understanding while we are still putting the final touches on things. We're so happy to hear our Curators were able to make your stay more enjoyable. Please come back and see us again!"
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,Hip Hotel in center of downtown!,Great spot! Hip Chic hotel with good service. Rooms were very nice with unique steel construction. Restaurant was delicious and the location was great. Light rail stop right in front of the hotel. Highly recommend!Thank you so much! We hope to have you back soon.
FOUND:RE Phoenix,4,"Fun, Clean, Unique Hotel but Bathroom Needs Attention","This hotel provided a stimulated experience with the abundance of local art on display. Pool was wonderful despite the shallow depth (4 feet). I was also amazed at how quiet it was given all of the negative review I read prior concerning noise levels. Hotel is immaculate, surrounded by nice eateries, coffee shops, and bars. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Overall, I had a great time. I like the new artsy vibe in downtown AZ. The only issues we experienced were 1) Bathroom sink kept clogging at night. 2) There are no hooks in the bathroom to hang towels (this we found quite annoying and odd).Thank you for taking the time to write a review. We're bummed we missed the mark in a couple of areas. Our engineering team has actually been going floor by floor to install the bathroom hooks over the past week and are still working on them. Hopefully, next time you visit you'll have them to use. As far as the bathroom sink, we will certainly have someone fix it!"
FOUND:RE Phoenix,5,Highly Recommend,"Had a great time, amazing place. Will definitely be returning. Did some hiking while we were there and had some great food. Great Decor and very friendly people. Like I said in the title, I highly recommend this place.Hi robertrykal, Thank you for sharing your experience with us! I'm so glad to hear you had a chance to enjoy our restaurant, MATCH Restaurant Lounge! Make sure you take advantage of our great summer rates so we can see you again soon!Have a great day!"
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,5,Great Service. Great Experience.,"We where a late check in and Juliana was so accommodating. I spoke to her a few hours earlier to ask if someone can set up the sofa bed on the room since we where running late and going straight to bed. She did that for us, which I really appreciate. Thanks. The breakfast was delicious and the two attendances where so sweet. I don't remember their names, but I just want to say thanks. The lady that speaks noticed my puertorrican accent and told me that she hopes that everything is good with my family back in the island. From the bottom of my heart thank you for been so sweet with me.During check out, Joy, was so understandable with me and my group.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,4,Great value,"I stayed for 2 nights here where the rooms and service met up with other Marriott properties I have stayed in the past. Like the other reviews here, the only issue here was hearing the train whistle. As I grew up close to a train crossing, hearing it didn't bother me but I could see how someone not used to it could be really shaken by the experience.Other than that, they offer a value-filled room with kitchenette, a well-equipped one at that. Similar to Residence Inn properties, there's a fridge, dishwasher, sink, and stove along with some basic cookware and utensils. This property even had a food disposal unit.As much as there was a bed, living area, bathroom, kitchenette, and work desk, there really wasn't much place to sit down and eat for more than one person. I suppose a group of people could eat in the living area but I wouldn't find it all that comfortable.The services available in the lobby were fantastic, there a computer with free internet AND free printing (although there's a 30-minute time limit to be fair to other guests). There's also complimentary coffee available all day and even a map of the general area where the attractions, shopping, and restaurants are listed."
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,3,Going to baseball-stay here! Disnleyland maybe not.,"Overall it wasn't a horrible stay. We wanted a suite since we were travelling with a baby and child. We were also going to disnleyland and wanted to be able to prep our lunches and come back to make dinner. The kitchens had everything you need!. The breakfast provided each morning was impressive. We first booked into a studio which didn't have a functioning bathtub so we very quickly got upgraded to a two bedroom suite which was extremely impressive. Loads of space. The first day our room got cLeaned the cleaners accidentally threw away my sons baby of baby food, formula and all his supplies. They say it was mistaken for garbage. After a mad dash to Target only a few minutes away is able to replace everything. They gave us a discount on our room. Don't know if I'd stay again as it was still a drive to/from disnleyland which was the main purpose of the holiday. It was close to shopping dining and groceries. If your going for baseball the field is across the road. People complained of trains but we were on the first floor facing the tracks and it didn't bother us one bit.Thank you for choosing the TownePlace Suites Anaheim for your stay. We are delighted to hear the kitchen in the guest room supplied everything you needed and found the complimentary morning breakfast impressive. Additionally, we are very truly sorry that your son's supplies were thrown away by accident. This issue will definitely be addressed in order to prevent this from happening again in the future, please accept our apologies. In addition, the hotel does offer an Anaheim Resort Transit (ART) shuttle stop right outside the front of the hotel and travels to Disneyland for a small fee it usually makes stops every hour daily during Disneys operating hours. The ART tickets can be purchased at our front desk daily and they are good for all day, so you can go back and forth as many times as you wish. We apologize if this was not offered to you upon check-in. Again, thank you for your review of the hotel as these reviews assist us in continuously looking at ways to enhance the stays of all our current and future guests."
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,5,Very Pleasantly Surprised,"My husband and I just completed a stay here and really loved it. The staff could not be more accommodating. Kitchens are really kitchens equipped a working oven. We barbequed steaks on the outside grill by the pool. However, do this before the sun goes down. There isn't much light in that area after dark. We did have small red ants upon arrival and they moved us to another, more expensive room without charge. Fantastic staff. This is really the only place to stay."
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,5,Flexible and prepared,"Joy! She was there whenever we needed anything and she was so flexible and understanding. She made great suggestions and understood what we needed before we did. That is kind of how the whole hotel worked. Everything was stocked, clean and worked well. You could ask any staff member for something and they made it happen. Breakfast was stocked and the staff members there were quick to clean and help out. I was really blown away by everyone's attitude. No one seemed to be tired of dealing with guests like you see at other hotels. Carlos checked us out and he showed us the same amount of flexibility and the didn't overcharge for things they could have. Also, it's a great location, close to anything you'd need.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,1,no room at the inn,"I would love to write a great reveiw to this Hotel, just like the majority of the other people here.However......I did not actually get to stay here. A booking was made by telephone for a 2 bed suite for New years Eve. We arrived ready to check in. Unfortunately the desk clerk was totally unhelpful. Our reservation was non existant. The clerk did not give a damn. We had travelled only a relatively short time (150 miles), but now were without accomodation on New Year. The clerk would not even help with finding an alternative. The reservation had been checked TWICE before arriving, The first time was 2 days prior, and then the night before arriving. The number we were given WAS confirmed both times on the phone, so we travelled to Anaheim without any worries. HOW WRONG WE WERE! The Reservation number that was confirmed twice has now upon arrival turned into a non existant number. There was no record of the whole transaction. After trying unsucsessfully to get any help whatsoever from the staff, we decided to give up and find an alternative. As can be expected the area was booked up, except for one place - a real roach motel. We chose to stay there (another bad choice) and had the worse night sleep ever . Thanks to Marriot the 2009 celebrations were ruined! What more can I say except - CHECK CHECK and double check, even after you receive a conformation number. Get it in writing!It looks like they had double booked and tried to fob us off . Hope this reveiw is helpful to everyone."
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,3,"Decent hotel, but light sleepers be warned......","My wife and a number of her co-workers were staying here for 2 weeks while working at the nearby convention center, I decided to tag along for 5 nights. The rooms come equipped with a small kitchen which is good for extended stays, however you would need a car as there is no grocery store within walking distance. The hotel is about a mile from Disneyland and the convention center, but is reight beside Angels Stadium and has some decent restaurants within walking distance. The biggest issue I had with the hotel is the noise from the trains passing by as the rail line is directly behind the hotel. The temperature was very comfortable in the evening so we left the windows open, big mistake. I was awakened at 4.30am by a train going through with its horn blaring, if you've seen My Cousin Vinnie it was pretty much like that. Having traveled from the east coast I was then wide awake. Trains start coming through on a regular basis after that, pretty much every 1/2 hour or hour. A number of people in our group had the same issues and resorted to Ambien to try and sleep through."
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,5,Excellent,"Everything was great. The workers at the front desk are all nice and very helpful. All the rooms are suites and they are all very clean and spacious. The best thing about it is the proximity to Angel Stadium. We went to go watch the Giants play the Angels for two days and the hotel is literally across the street from the stadium. They even let you choose what you want from their continental breakfast when you check in and have it ready for you to pick up in the morning in the lobby. There are also places to eat very close by and although we didn't get in (not enough time) the pool it looked clean and like a nice place to relax. I will definitely stay here again whenever I am in Anaheim, great hotel for a great price."

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,4,Great value with points for Disneyland Visitors,"I tend to be pretty loyal to Marriott brands and built up quite a bank of Marriott points, so when I went to book a room in Anaheim for a trip to Disneyland using my points I booked the Towneplace Suites for three reasons: (1) It was a much better value than any of the other Marriott properties in Anaheim, as it was a Category 3 for points redemption while the others were at least a Category 5.(2) It was the only Marriott property in Anaheim that did not charge a daily parking fee. (3) Free continental breakfast. I tend to be pretty cost conscious, so I would much rather fill up on a free hotel breakfast than pay for fast food or worse pay Disneyland food prices.I still had a few doubts, but I went into the stay with an open mind and wasn't disappointed. My biggest concern, the location in relation to Disneyland, ended up being a non-issue. The Anaheim Resort Transit shuttle ran like clockwork and I could be to the parks in less than 20 minutes. At a cost of only 12 for a three-day pass, it was much cheaper than parking at Disneyland and probably a good bit quicker as well. Even though the hotel isn't within walking distance of Disneyland I wouldn't hesitate to book again. The location was also a plus when I went to the Angels baseball game, as the stadium is about a half mile walk from the hotel. The room itself was more than adequate. The full size fridge and kitchenette with a dishwasher and stove was impressive but probably unnecessary for most hotel guests, however with the microwave and stocked dishes it would be very easy to prepare simple meals in the room to avoid the expense of eating out. The sleeping area was a totally separate bedroom which made it feel a little small, but it is probably about the same size as you would find in other Towneplace and other Marriott suite-style hotels. I think it is just the lack of openness that makes it feel small. Everything was nice and clean, no complaints there.I see that someone else complained about the breakfast, but I think it was as good as should be expected for free. I have seen fancier, but during my stay the breakfast included cereal (6 types), bagels, English muffins, yogurt, fresh whole fruit, instant oatmeal, and boxes of raisins (quite honestly I grabbed a few boxes each morning for snacks while in Disneyland). My only criticism would be to wait a little while longer to start shutting the breakfast area down, as 9:30am is still pretty early and most of these folks are on vacation after all.My only other complaint would be the toilet paper. I don't necessarily expect the nicest paper out there, but the stuff in my room was the roughest single-ply toilet paper I've ever seen. I think most gas station bathrooms have higher quality toilet paper than this. It just seems pretty ironic that while there was shampoo and conditioner by Paul Mitchell the hotel couldn't spend a little more for a decent two-ply. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel for anyone going to Disneyland or to an Angels games, although I may encourage them to bring their own TP."
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,5,Great suite next to Angels stadium w/ 3 separate beds,"Nice suite with 2 bedrooms fold out couch- was great to have 3 separate places to sleep, for 3 guys in town for LA Angels vs Red Sox baseball game.. Great ideal location for ballpark access- w/ parking included easy walk to ball field. Great breakfast. Best value for suite of any hotel i stayed in over my week in California.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,4,"Convenient, Clean Easy Access for Disneyland visit",For a very quick trip to Disneyland we stayed at the Townplace Suites. The lobby and rooms are small but well organized and clean. The free breakfast was a hit but the small lobby can get crowded early in the morning as everyone heads out to Disneyland. Easy shuttle service from the hotel directly to Disneyland. There is a pool but we were too tired to take advantage of it! Good selection of family freindly restaurant and entertainment options right next to the hotel so all around a very good choice.Thank you so much for staying with us. I am glad that your family enjoyed your time here with us. Maybe next time you can take advantage of our pool area the next time your in the Anaheim area. We look forward to your next arrival.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,4,Wonderful stay,"We loved our stay here. Our favorite is Miss Domi who is so friendly and greeting everyone with her sweet smile.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,4,Clean and Friendly,"I had planned a last minute trip in to Anaheim to go for a Birthday event at Disney, the entire city was sold out but Townplace had a few rooms available. We generally dont stay this far away from Disney but we had no choice. Room rates were out of control because of a conference and most hotels were sold out! I have to say we were pleasantly surprised with the hotel. My experience at check -in was fantastic, the rooms were clean the energy was good and overall we didn't care that we were a few miles away from Disney. We Were happy with our stay. The only thing I could say that I was not crazy about was the commuter train that passes through the back of the Hotel. Other than that I would recommend this place to any of my friends or family membersWe appreciate your business and value your honest feedback.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,3,Roomy rooms,"The rooms were very spacious and clean however, very noisy being on the second floor. Kids jumping and running all hours of day and night. Front staff were very helpful and the breakfast was great. Shuttle (ART pay as you go or get a pass at the office) was just outside the door as was Denny's and Starbucks. Not the usual Mariott standard though. Older- small pool. --Hence the 3 star.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for your review. I am sorry to hear that we did not live up to your expectations.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,1,Rats and dirty!!,"We stay at this hotel every year same time for an event at Angel Stadium the 1st weekend in Jan.We never have issues but when it rains it pours with this group...We checked in and they lost our reservation because I had called on a re-rate. They changed the name on the reservation, they changed it from a one bed to a studio and raised the rate from 109 to 129 We booked in Oct but 1st of Nov they put up a disclaimer that the hotel is under remodel...but the disclaimer was not on the webpage when we booked. Remodel is an understatement its a train wreck. There was 4 or 6 couches piled up in front of a cargo bin just sitting there with some other ragged furniture and lamps in part of the parking lot.Our 1st room was nice but getting to the room was a mess, floorboards missing, walls messed up, the door wide open to the electronics closet which cant be seen by the front desk so anyone could walk in and create havoc. I am sure there is credit card info in those backup etc.It was late about 10:30 and we rented a PPV and then we hear something in the kitchen area and its a rat that runs behind the stove and now is stuck and screaming. So we go down to the front desk and then send a guy up to try and catch the rat. He cant catch it so they tell us we need to move to the other building.We do and its a bigger mess then the 1st building. There is black goop all over the floor in leading to the elevator and then in the elevator too, the 2nd building is old,smells and needs remodel bad. The new room is 2 bedroom but its hit and miss, way to much furniture, kitchen is dated, microwave falling down, dusty and dirty and about a 3 gap under the front door so someone could look in if they wanted.When we tell them the room will not work they offer to move us back to the 1st building but to the room a joining the room with the ratIt was just a trip hotel from hell which is really sad because its normally an ok hotel. We book next time at Hilton.Was really disappointed that management didn't reach out to us in till we contacted them.John Dominguez Assistant GM useless!Thank you for rating us on trip advisor as we are always looking to improve our hotel and do well by all of our guests. As most business professionals I was not available during the weekend while you were here at the property: however, we always have a manager on duty.As we are currently undergoing renovations, we have the challenge of insuring that our hotel continues to operate with minimal disruption to our guests. We understand that finding a mouse in your room can be an unnerving situation and tried to put you at ease for the duration of your stay. My staff did need to relocate you to another room so that we could have an external company resolve the issue which has now been rectified and make sure that you had a comfortable and pest free stay.Im happy to see that my staff offered you an upgraded newly renovated accessibility suite that did not have any adjoining wall or door to the previous room. We are sorry that you declined it. My understanding is the manager also offered to purchase a shower chair as the remaining 16 accessible rooms were fully committed. The Suite that you were relocated to was an upgraded suite as an additional apology for the issue that occurred. In my email to you on Monday after you had departed I explained that the renovation construction team working in the building you had relocated to did in fact make scuff marks on the floor from the tires of the dolly's that they were using to move the larger furniture out of the rooms to make way for the new furniture that we were receiving. As we placed you in an un-renovated suite for the final part of your stay, I can understand why you would feel it was out dated as the renovation is to give us a more modern and updated look and this suite had not been completed as of yet. As per Marriott standard the renovation information was available to all guests as of the beginning of October prior to when your reservation was made. Jeanette the Manager on duty removed your charges for the first night due to the mouse incident, while isolated, is unacceptable. We sincerely apologize as no guest should ever experience that. As you have stated, you have stayed with us numerous times and have never had any issues.The room you noticed with the door opened was awaiting a new air conditioning unit, there is nothing in this room that would present a security issue for our guests. We will also be purchasing some extra assistance chairs to accommodate past our eighteen accessibility rooms. again our apologies that your stay was less than perfect. We hope that you will give us another opportunity to welcome you again during the annual super cross event at Angel Stadium."
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,4,The 2 bedroom suite is great for a large family,"We stayed here when we came to Anaheim to watch Angels games two nights in a row. It was the perfect location. It is across the street from the stadium and there are a few places to eat that range from Carls Jr to a nicer sit down restaurant (The Catch I think). The hotel provides a continental breakfast which was a pretty standard hotel breakfast. It's always convenient when traveling with kids. There was barely any room to sit and very busy. One morning I ended up finding a table and the next morning I took our food out to the pool and sat out there with the kids which was very peaceful. The pool area is small, but enough to keep the kids busy for a couple of hours. It was a nice temperature, not too cold. They also loved going between the pool and jacuzzi. The room slept 6 of us, but was not spacious. It was nice to have the 2 queens in separate bedrooms and a living area, so if someone wanted to rest, they could close the door and others could watch TV in another room. There were 3 TVs. The beds were OK. The bathroom was small considering the room slept 6 people (not 6 adults, but doable with a mixture of adults and kids). The kitchen area was more than adequate to bring some food with you, prepare it and not eat out every meal. The decor is updated, but some areas of the room felt worn. The room was clean and we had excellent service at the front desk.Hello Snulie,Thank you for taking the time to write such a wonderful review about your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott. It is candid reviews like yours, that allow us to continually look at ways to make guest's stay more comfortable and relaxing. I have mentioned your comments to the appropriate department managers, and we are brainstorming ways to review your areas of concern. We are delighted to serve you again, if your travel needs bring you back to the Orange County area. Thanks again!Warmest Regards"
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,3,BUSINESS TRIP PART V (SF TO ANAHEIM),"HOTEL STAYThe company I work for is located in San Francisco. Last week I was sent down to the Anaheim office for 2 1/2 days from Wednesday to Friday. During my business trip last week I stayed at this hotel for two nights. Originally my boss tried to book my reservation at Ayres Hotel, which according to him was about 220 yards away from the office. However the second night was fully booked. The last minute my boss booked the other closest hotel, which is TownePlace Suites Anaheim. According to Google Maps the location of this hotel is about a 10 minute walk. I've walk from this hotel to the office. The walking time was a lot less then 10 minutes. I cannot compare this hotel to Ayres Hotel at the moment. However this hotel is not only close to the Anaheim office but also is situated with a lot of nice restaurants that are one block away. The room I stayed in was a studio suite, which included a kitchen. There was decent space inside the room unlike most hotel rooms as this room had a couch and kitchen. Twice at night around 9PM I swam at the swimming pool and sat in the whirlpool. The swimming pool was slightly heated while the whirlpool was really heated. Going to the swimming area helped me relax from that day's work. The one main knock I would say is the complimentary breakfast. The breakfast is buffet style with pastry, bread, coffee, eggs, and sausage. Both times I've had breakfast the eggs were overcooked and the sausage was cold. I don't mind if the complimentary breakfast was only pastry and coffee. However if there is hot, cooked food on the complimentary breakfast then items such as fried eggs and sausages shouldn't be stale. Overall I enjoyed my two nights at this hotel during my business trip.We are delighted to have been your chosen hotel during your recent stay in Anaheim.

We arrived a bit before the posted check in and before too long, we were able to go to our room. I have to say the visit to the Towneplace Suites, Anaheim was made exceptional by the staff that works there, notably Adilene at the front desk.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,5,Perfect for families,"We stayed in a two bedroom apartment during our stay in Anaheim in June 2004. We have two young children (3 and 5). The apartment was clean and well equipped. The beds were comfy and the linen fresh. We loved the location, near Dennys, Starbucks, Panda Express and Mc Donalds. We made our booking on the net from Australia and found our requests had been answered perfectly. ( A corner non-smoking room). Another great feature was the free parking and free shuttle to Disneyland. There were three T.V.'s all having cable, which the kids loved. There was a bath, lots of towels.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,1,Worst visit ever!,"I am a gold elite member with the Marriott brand. We stayed here earlier this month. I didn't have time to get around to making a complaint because we were getting things done for my mother in law's funeral. First off the first room we were given smelled like mildew. It was disgusting. So I went to the front desk and was given a second room next door to this room. It did not smell any better. So I was given a third room this time in the main building. So we move our things to this room. I brush my teeth and get into bed it was then 1:00am approximately. I lay on the right side of the bed and the bed breaks!! I am about 180 pounds why is the bed breaking I fall out of the bed and hit my head on the corner of the night stand. At this point I am beyond furious. I calmly walk back to the lobby and explain to the gentleman. He apologizes and I am given a fourth room. The next morning I go to down to talk to the manager but the manager is in a meeting and the lady at the front desk rudely tells me the guy from night shift comped my room what else do I want. I could've of choked the ignorant lady. So I checkout and move to a different hotel. A manager named Patrick calls and leaves a voicemail the next afternoon. I called Patrick back multiple times and left voicemails. Never received a phone call at all or email nothing. We have stayed at this hotel for almost 5 years in a row. It's the only hotel we stay at in Anaheim. This is beyond ridiculous. Category 6 this place should be more of an 2 or 3. I have stayed at nicer category 3,4,5 hotels. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. Is this the type of name Marriott wants for itself Should I take my loyalty to a different brand Dear floydmcmillan2007,Good Day, Please accept my sincere apology on behalf of Towne place suites Anaheim, I am very sorry to learn that your experience with us during your visit was not up to your par .

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,3,"Average at best, this location shows its wear tear","Clearly this is a popular hotel. One look at the lobby area, the common areas, and your room will tell you this hotel gets lots and lots of use. It looks like it needs some TLC and a face lift. Nothing is dirty, just shabby. Nothing is worn to a fray, just run down. The staff is friendly and efficient but not especially helpful. The furnishings in the room were probably highly functional when installed but now really show their age and overuse. The sofa in my room was stained in many places. The linens were gray from cleaning too many times, the bed a little lumpy from too many nights use without replacement.Not a bad hotel, just not a great hotel either.Dear GoldenBearHusker,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Marriott.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,2,"Good brand, but poor uptake",Overall we are Marriott Gold Elite members and have the Marriott credit card so we really do Marriott all the time but this is one of the locations that has very poor upkeep. Our room had a funny mold smell and the sink and shower did not drain properly there was the toilet paper roll that was broken a picture frame was not mounted correctly and fell to the floor. The microwave was mounted not at a level. And the list goes on...Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts regarding this issue. We appreciate you bringing it to our attention. We will share your message appropriately within the organization. Edgar RiveraGeneral Manager
TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,3,Pretty good place - would stay again,"We stayed here for a trip to Disneyland. The good: 1 bedroom suite was very large. The bedroom area was small but the living area was huge. Great working/desk area and very nice kitchenette with a nearly full sized refrigerator, small stove, microwave, etc. Some things were recently renovated and looked very nice. The staff was great, helpful and friendly. Location was great, lots of stuff nearby, on the ART route to Disney and close to freeways. Breakfast was small but a decent selection - the waffles were really good and they had trays so that you could take food back to your room. The bad: some parts of the hotel have not been renovated, so there is a mix of new/nice and old/run down in the same room (i.e bathroom counters were nice, but the rest of the bathroom was dated. Old dresser in the bedroom, but tv's were nicer. The carpeting was old, and the door to the room was worn and actually had some non matching paint spots covering some type of damage, but the kitchenette was very nice as was the desk area and newer cabinets that were part of the desk area. For having a large living space, there wasn't a lot of seating. So, there was a small sofabed, and a table with just one chair. It would be nice to have the table and 4 chairs so that if multiple people are in the room (a standard family) there would be places to sit as the couch would only really fit 2-3 people. the other bad was that while I booked the room using Marriott points and was told that they would only place a 40 hold for incidentals on my credit card, the system automatically puts a hold for 170 for each night of your stay, unless the clerk removes your card info and overrides the system. I didn't know this until i looked online at my credit card account. Fortunately, Sam at the front desk was great and got the hold for the first night removed and made sure that no hold was placed on the 2nd night. Still though, unsettling to have some unexpected holds on your account. I've never had that happen at any other marriott property. I also had trouble connecting to the wifi, it kept giving me an error that I couldn't log into the wifi with my room number and last name. But, it actually still connected me on all devices I tried, so I just ignored the error and it worked just fine.Martha C.Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at the TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate.

TownePlace Suites Anaheim Maingate Near Angel Stadium,5,Very friendly staff !!,"I was visiting the area for business and picked this hotel for its proximity to my meetings. I had some flight issues flying into California, so had to call and change my reservation. When I called the hotel I spoke with Viri, who was super helpful and very friendly. She took care of everything and had a great sense of humor. When I checked in Viri happened to be working with a few others at the front desk. They were all extremely friendly and welcoming. The coffee in the lobby all day is a nice perk. I was unable to enjoy breakfast, but it looked nice as I grabbed an apple and ran out the door to meetings. I will definitely be staying at this location if I have any future business in the Anaheim area. Management should be proud of their friendly, helpful, and smiling staff."
Maison de Macarty,5,Outstanding service,"First time in New Orleans, planned to stay here for 3 nights but ended up staying for 5. Mainly because he owners, Lauren and Daniel are such excellent hosts. Great advice on where to go and what to do, nothing better than a local to give you advice. The hotel was quiet when we were there so Lauren and Daniel sat with us a breakfast and helped us plan our day. Rooms spotlessly clean. All of their suggestions were spot on. Good little pool with sun deck, unusual for a BB. We visited the WW11 museum which is outstanding but allow at least 4 hours for your visit. Burboun St was a disappointment, but go to Frenchman St for great music and food. Try 30/90o bar for music. Highly recommended and within walking distance, is the Lounge (best ribs ever). Another reviewer spoke of the area, we drove down from Houston and arrived about 6pm, we were slightly concerned as the area has some building with a lot of graffiti on them, however they are being developed and the owners said the area has changed a great deal over the last few years, and is becoming one of NO sought after places to live. Its abut a 5/10 minute trip by uber/taxi into the French quarter. Altogether a great place to stay and would highly recommend."
Hotel Storyville,5,Extremely accomodating host in a great location!,"The owner of The Hotel Storyville went above and beyond to help us put on a birthday party in the garden. The evening was a great success. The rooms were clean and well-furnished, and the location can't be beat."
Econo Lodge,1,THE WORST PLACE EVER!!!!,"This thing doesnt have to be called a hotel, this is the worst place ever!!!!!!!!Hygiene is something the hotel doesnt know exsists, you can see food, cigarettes, used condoms and much more just a feet outside your door.Nasty parties during night!! We even had to call the police one night!!!!Just dont go to that place ever!"
Ace Hotel New Orleans,3,Disappointing,"Very impressed with the scene when I walked in. Didn't take me long to realize that the Ace has focused on aesthetics rather than service. I arrived 90 minutes after check in time. Took them over 30 minutes to get it ready. In the meantime, I had to first deal with a smug wannabe hipster and then a woman who... More"
Ace Hotel New Orleans,4,Great experience,We thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience in this recently opened dining room. The steak can only be described as succulent. The wait staff was professional and attentive. The atmosphere was warm combining contemporary furnishings with what I assume to be 19th century architecture. We really enjoyed the jazz band which performed in a smallish room adjacent to the bar.
Ace Hotel New Orleans,3,Watch out for the concrete column in room 601!,"This really is a great boutique hotel. The bed was comfortable, the shower hot and refreshing. Nicely appointed and great customer service. Why only 3 stars This hotel was obviously a factory or warehouse at one stage, so the concrete support column in the bedroom is a necessity. (See photo). However, it is painted black and at 3am whenI got... More"
XV Beacon,5,"Perfect location, attentive service and luxurious rooms","We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at XV Beacon. All of the staff was friendly and attentive. The location is perfect for exploring Boston and for anywhere a little further, a driving service is offered. The driver, Mark, was very friendly and made sure to point out notable sites along the drive. The rate is expensive, but we enjoyed the high-level of service with multiple tidy services offered each day. The room was very comfortable for us."
Bricco Suites,5,Suite hideaway,Great place right in the middle of the north end. Literally on Hanover street Room was clean and looked brand new. There is no parking so we stayed at haymarket garage and walked 5 minutes. Check in at restaurant
Bricco Suites,5,Great location,"The location for this hotel is great right in the middle of the North End and close walking distance to Faneuil Hall, etc. modern efficient with large TV and electric fireplace. Very nice bathroom with standup shower but lacking in horizontal surfaces for toiletries."
Beacon Hill Hotel and Bistro,4,not bad,The hotel itself is lovely and the staff were very kind and helpful. Just a couple of downsides the shower gel was low throughout our stay and you could get hardly any out i was a bit surprised this wasn't checked during housekeeping. The shower itself also wasn't very powerful. We had a clock in the room but it wasn't showing the right time and appeared to be out of battery didnt think this looled very good. The air conditioning was quite noisy but you could get a good temperature. We enjoyed our stay though as i said just a few minor things.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Boston at Logan Airport,5,Nice place with a 5 minute shuttle ride,Nice place with a great staff. This place is clean and well maintained. Being Massachusetts there are no alcoholic beverages during the managers reception. The breakfast was great too. The bar remains open until midnight and is a great place to unwind after visiting the city.
The College Club of Boston,5,good,"overnight in walking distance of subway , parks and downtown. Staff was very helpful. Good value for the money"
The College Club of Boston,5,Brief stop-over,"Arriving after a long flight, it was a delight to find such a tranquil, beautiful haven. My room was large and full of lovely antiques and there was everything a tired traveller could wish for. I've already recommended it to a friend."
The College Club of Boston,3,Victorian Ambiance,Really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to just about anyone. Loved the old Victorian ambiance and decor. The location was prime for us - we walked everywhere. Downsides are parking - had to park in the Commons garage but pretty walk back as long as it's not raining or snowing. And I really got the impression that a more traditional American bfast would be served but it was more like what you get at a chain hotel.
The College Club of Boston,4,An Underwhelming Bed,"I stayed one night at this beautiful building in Back Bay. Unfortunately, my particular room had a very uncomfortable bed that was not level. I believe the problem was the mattress itself just being old, not the bed frame. I had to put a book between the mattress and the box spring to level it a bit. Additionally, the room was extremely hot, owing to the radiator being left on while the room was empty. I recommend that the hotel consider keeping the heat off between guests. Otherwise, the facility was great. The public areas are beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful."
The College Club of Boston,5,Like staying over at a friend's,"Unbeatable location next to Newbury street. Lovely clean, comfortable room with amenities . Generous continental breakfast. Coffee and tea always available (often with delicious cookies) Very friendly helpful staff. Very easy to come and go as they give you the code. Third time staying here.Thank you for your kind words. We always enjoy seeing you and your family! Looking forward to welcoming you again!"
The College Club of Boston,3,Shared bathroom,I didn't notice that this hotel room has shared bathroom. It was very inconvenient for me.
The College Club of Boston,3,Noisy on the weekends,"The location of this hotel was amazing and the price was right. Unfortunately, it was a weekend and the hotel was hosting a wedding. As a result, it was very loud. I was assured by the staff that it would end around 10:30, but the party was yelling and slamming doors until at least 11:30. There was a note in my room to respect quiet time from 10p-6a, but I guess that applied only to me. I had an early morning event to attend, so I wouldn't recommend staying here on a weekend if you intend to get any rest. Also, my room had a shared bath, which was very poorly treated by whomever else was sharing it. Be advised that sometimes other guests might not be as civilized as you are."
"The Roosevelt New Orleans, A Waldorf Astoria Hotel",4,Grand historic old hotel,"Great location, beautiful decor. The lobby Sazerac bar is extremely popular and claims to be the birthPlace of its namesake drink. Note to older folks: The old bathroom tubs are extremely difficult to get into and out of to shower."
"The Roosevelt New Orleans, A Waldorf Astoria Hotel",5,Best Hotel in New Orleans,"If you are looking for a hotel near the French quarter and want luxury and service - this is the hotel for you. All rooms were clean, a good size and beautiful.The staff were so helpful and we are in the hotel restaurant a couple of times and the food was delicious and very helpful staff.When we come to New Orleans again this hotel is a must for us.SandGT,Thank you for taking time to leave feedback on our hotel! We take pride in giving excellent service for everyone who walks through our hotel, and are happy to hear that you loved your stay with us, as well as the helpfulness of the staff! The Food Beverage team will be thrilled to hear of your love of the food as well! We are lucky to work in a historic property in its prime location, but know that without a consistent level of top notch service our guests would choose one of the many other options nearby. Again, thank you for promoting us on TripAdvisor. We look forward to hosting you during your next stay! Have a wonderful day!"
Cornstalk Hotel,5,2-day stay,"This is a beautiful, clean, well-maintained hotel located one block off of Bourbon Street. We had a first floor room--presumably loudest in terms of street noise, but apart from hearing people in the lobby checking in or out, it was incredibly quiet! The bathroom is tiny but very clean, the towels are plush and large, the bedding is luxurious. The... More"
Cornstalk Hotel,4,Historic Charm on Royal St,"I stayed in two seperate rooms at this hotel. The first was 209 upstairs over looking the shared balcony. It was small but clean and gorgeous, perfect for one person. My only complaint is the Windows don't open, as they've been painted over. Would be nice to get some fresh air, although this room has its own thermostat with air. The staff was amazing and watched my bags for me the entire next afternoon after check out, as I wasn't sure if I was gonna stay again or not. I decided to stay, and they offered me a similar rate to the first night even though prices went WAY up. The girls at the front desk are super awesome. The next room I stayed in was downstairs, definitely larger than the first, just as beautiful but different. The energy was different, it was dark, and I had a few issues with cell phone reception, not picking up the guest wifi and a broken TV that they couldn't do anything about. Overall I loved staying at this hotel. It felt special. It is special. Its a fantastic hotel to stay at if you want the NOLA French Quarter experience. On a personal note: this hotel is definitely haunted. I not only had the same dream both nights that were pretty spooky and gruesome, but I awoke the second morning to someone humming softly into my ear and a grab/scratch at the back of my neck. Let's just say my heart was POUNDING!"
Cornstalk Hotel,4,Cornstalk Hotel,"Beautiful mansion, always wanted to stay there. Could you use some improvements on the building. Definitely need new mattresses - ours was lumpy and worn out feeling. Beautiful antiques, wonderful staff - very friendly and helpful. Ideal location in the quarter."
Cornstalk Hotel,5,Wonderful Old New Orleans Hotel,We had an amazing time at the Cornstalk Hotel. Ms.Sharon was wonderful. The hotel is a lovely old New Orleans style. It's cozy and romantic. I look forward to going back for another visit. We went for our 25th Anniversary and the staff went above and beyond to make it extra special. Thank you!
Cornstalk Hotel,5,Wonderful stay,"Beautiful place near Bourbon Street but quiet. Staff was warm and welcoming, rooms were very clean and full of charm. Would recommend to anyone. Very close to restaurants and other places to visit. Great trip. Thank you"
Cornstalk Hotel,3,Could easily be so much more.,"Dirty carpet, dirty bathroom flooring. One light out in the bathroom. Poor lighting in the room bathroom for applying make-up. Wall of windows should have black out curtains and shades. Walking in tot he cornstalk it smells like Pot Smoking 4 days out of the 6 we stayed."
Cornstalk Hotel,5,Love this Hotel!!!!,One of the best places you will ever stay in New Orleans. Absolutely delightful and right in the middle of the quarter but far enough away from the noise. This exceptional Hotel has been around for a very long time and there is a reason. Pure beauty and fabulous staff.
Cornstalk Hotel,5,Cornstalk,"I loved my stay at Cornstalk. The atmosphere is very family-like and personal. Shay was amazing, made cookies and made me feel like family. The big chain hotels can't compete with how the Cornstalk Hotel makes you feel at home, even when your thousands of miles away from home."
Cornstalk Hotel,5,Excellent Place to Stay,"Was in an old 1800's house, hotel has 14 rooms only, rooms are small but we'll appointed. Room 101 is known as the Elvis Room, he stayed here during a filming on one of his movies."
Cornstalk Hotel,3,I would return- to the 1st floor!,Stay downstairs- no elevators. No bell hops. No amenities- BUT great location within walking distance to everything in The French Quarter. Historic and beautiful. Hope someone will restore great old home to better amenities.
Cornstalk Hotel,5,So close to everything.,"Great stay overall, the room was supposed to have a balcony but it wasn't open. Will definitely go again if we get the chance though."
Cornstalk Hotel,5,Such a great historic place to stay!,"We stayed here for a night and absolutely loved it. The hotel staff were courteous, helpful, and very personable. The only thing we could suggest is that they could have something other than water for their guests to drink. Other than that (and that wasn't really a big deal at all), everything was splendid."
French Quarter Suites Hotel,1,Roaches. Rudeness. Regret.,"This hotel is perfect for being close to everything, but that is all it is perfect for. We had a cockroach in our room the last night we stayed there, and thank god it was the last night. They clearly do not have a pest control contract that treats the place for roaches regularly enough. I could see the lights... More"
French Quarter Suites Hotel,5,One Great Experience!!!,"Just have to give this hotel a thumbs up for making a great visit to the French Quarters even better. The workers were hospitable, friendly, and went out of their way to make sure we were taken care of. We stayed in the two bedroom suite, and for the value, it was just right. The room was clean, everything was... More"
French Quarter Suites Hotel,2,Not very happy with the service.,"Hotel looks very dark, weird smell 105 dollars per night. Complementary Internet and continental breakfast. Location is in French area very handy if u want to go out. Small pool of u want to swimming. 25 dollars parking."
French Quarter Suites Hotel,5,HIDDEN GEM,"This was an unexpected surprise! We usually stay on Canal or with friends but this will change that in the future. Loved the hardwood floors and quaint atmosphere. There were no kids running around and it is less than 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street. Continental breakfast, coffee ALL DAY, and really good cafes nearby, open 24 hours or at least late night. Parking lot is secured at night, cameras monitoring as well. Also right across from trolley stop (so convenient-did not have to move the car)!! Wi-fi included"
French Quarter Suites Hotel,3,Not worth the money,"This hotel is beautifully located in the NE corner of the French Quarter. It is one block to the trolley station on the newly completed Rampart Street line. I give the trolley system 5 stars for convenience, value (3.00 per day), and ease of use. The hotel itself is somewhat clean on the surface. The laminate floors in our unit... More"
French Quarter Suites Hotel,4,It is in the French Quarter.,"Very nice staff. (They must have fired all the the rude people I read about in the reviews. LOL) Safe area (for New Orleans. For the people who said it was in a bad neighborhood, this is not Mayberry. ) The cost was a bit excessive in my opinion. Over 250 for one night ( although that did include parking. and it was an event weekend.) The facilities are nice. You can sit on the wrought iron balcony and watch the French Quarter wake up. The location is convenient and close to everything. The only reason this is not a 5 star review is that the shower was dirty. For that kind of money, I at least want to wash my old behind in a clean shower. The bed was VERY FIRM. It was too firm for my wife and me, but I hear some people like firm mattresses, so this would be right up your ally if you do. The second floor seems to be the best as far as views, I think. Third floor could be a beating on older folks because of the stairs. Also, there are two seperate hotels. I saw where a lady was complaining about having to walk from the office to another building. This is because she went to the wrong one, initially. There is French Quarter Suites, and New Orleans Courtyard Hotel. I think the NO Courtyard is a little higher end. Overall good experience. I will be back, but not on an event weekend."
French Quarter Suites Hotel,5,Dad's birthday!,"The staff is outstanding, and they helped us with directions and where to go for awesome food, etc. Rooms are large and clean. Pool is very nice, and it's located just close enough to the French Quarter to have fun but also sleep in a nice, quiet hotel when you've had enough fun! Loved this place!!"
Soniat House,4,"Lovely hotel, but...","This is a lovely hotel where one is made to feel very welcome. An extra bonus (for cat lovers, at least) is Claire, the resident cat. The hotel is ideally located for exploring the utterly charming French Quarter. Our room was beautiful and very comfortable but as this is an old building, it is not very soundproof and other guests talking in the courtyard and entryway and wheeling their luggage around disturbed us early each morning - at 4am during the first night. The Frette linens and Molton Brown toiletries were much appreciated luxury touches. We were however disappointed by the breakfast - we ordered toast in preference to biscuits and one slice of toast each seemed rather meagre. Be warned - the coffee is flavoured with chicory - a New Orleans tradition but not to our taste. I would recommend this as a place to stay if you are happy to put up with the quirks of an old building but suggest eating breakfast elsewhere.We usually do have pure coffee in the freezer. We don't get many requests but we try to stay prepared. You simply needed to request it. I doubt that anyone could find breakfast spots in New Orleans that serve pure coffee. New Orleans traditional caf au lait is French roasted chicory coffee served with an equal part of warm milk. That is what we serve. That is what Caf du Monde serves. We are famous for our buttermilk biscuits but we do keep gluten free and whole grain bread for the guests who don't eat white flour. I do apologize that you were served only two slices of toast. An order of biscuits if four therefore an order of toast should also be at least four.Please if your travels bring you back to New Orleans give us another try. In addition to the tea , hot chocolate and iced coffee that are always available we will brew pure for you each morning. We will also give you a room on the second or third floor or even on the other side of the street so if we have late arrivals or early departures you won't be disturbed.Claire would be disappointed if you went elsewhere and so would I"
Soniat House,5,"An Absolute Gem, Superb Staff, Bliss! Every Boutique Hotel should use this as its template","Even before I arrived at Soniat I had an insight into the warm hospitality that was the theme throughout our stay. From the warm, helpful welcome from Mark and his coleague, to the professional manner of Calvin, the housekeepers and the managers, they could not do enough. I hesistate to use the term hotel to describe Soniat, that's like calling Buckingham palace a house. The rooms are luxurious, I really want that bed in my home. Situated on a peaceful street, with a church next door, and well situated to get around the French quarter, and other attractions. Everything is quaint, peaceful, and friendly, a haven. The setting is beautiful courtyards, with water features, classical music played softly, and a well stocked honour bar, what more could you want...wait did I mention breakfast No meals are served apart from breakfast and I absolutley rate it as a five star experience, my first taste of American biscuits was fab, they have to be the best biscuits, fresh orange juice, great coffee (apologies I'm drooling just thinking about it). It was a great choice, we hope to be back and I am more than willing to recommend it to anyone looking for an oasis of calm, warm hospitality. Go, you won't regret it.Wow!You have made my day!What a kind and thoughtful review. Thank you so very much for taking the time.It would be a real pleasure to welcome you back."
The Pontchartrain Hotel,1,Closed for remodel,From all outside appearance this facility is closed for remodeling as well as restaurants. Great location. Hope it is open on my next visit to NOLA. Lots of eating places in the area. Have to do minimum of 200 characters but not sure what more I can add to IT'S CLOSED!!!!
The Pontchartrain Hotel,5,Wonderful hotel,I was really happy with my experience at this hotel! I stayed here for a weekend in August. The room was nice and extremely clean. The staff was incredibly friendly. I loved the bathroom and it had a great shower. Right outside the hotel is a stop for the streetcar so its in a great location too. Absolutely no complaints...

The Pontchartrain Hotel,5,World-class service in a comfy setting with great music and views,Pontchartrain Hotel has friendly service and guest rooms that are beautifully appointed to the smallest detail to ensure luxury and comfort. The beds are lavishly comfy the bedding luxurious. The public rooms are opulent and welcoming. The homemade ginger beer was better than fever tree (my favorite) The bartenders are first-rate and the view from the rooftop are is magnificent.... More
The Pontchartrain Hotel,3,Average at best,"Agree with previous review, renovation consisted of mostly new paint. No fault of hotel, but be prepared for a night with plenty of noise....street cars passing all night!! Food at restaurants is excellent. Employees are very nice. If you are looking for a really first class hotel at this price point, I would suggest Ritz Carlton, Windsor Court, Roosevelt. One... More"
The Pontchartrain Hotel,4,"Older hotel, but a quality experience","The location of this hotel is great. It's in a lovely spot on St. Charles and it's very easy to get around with the streetcar stop right outside.

Martinique Motel,4,Pleasently surprized,We drove down with no reservation on sat. Dec. 31st to bring in the new year. It's located within eye sight of tropicana and was the cheapest out of all in the area. The staff showed me the room before I rented it and had a safe location to park my car. It was great we had the deck above... More
The Annex at The Chelsea,1,Not Worth it!!!,"First thing totally rude staff!! Front desk check in took a hour! Hidden 125 fee.. i booked trip advisor all fees payed i thought. Okay now to the hotel .. Dirty! Throw up in pool so we couldnt swim.. throw up in iceroom which is a empty piss smelled closet, could go on.. i wont!"
The Annex at The Chelsea,1,Getaway,"Absolutely disgusting!!! I rather stay in my car!!! Everything about this place is gross.. including the rude staff. This is not the Tropicana and should not be promoted as if it was apart of it. I will NEVER stay here again!!! Broken mirrors, dirty towels, smelly smoky room, old food in the refrigerator from a prior guest, toilet paper was on the floor, shower was moldy, creepy old elevator that sounded like it was going to break down... JUST PLAIN GROSS"
The Annex at The Chelsea,1,Crack House Living,"When we first got to the Hotel I was parallel parking and A bum try to pretend to get hit by me. Then asked me for money. Then we checked in an that was painless. We got to our room and I felt like I was in a crack house. Our reservation said a balcony which there was not. The windows were so high that you couldn't see out side unless you stood on a chair. It felt like we were in a dungeon but we were on the second floor. No fridge ,no safe. It looked like someone stole the fridge."
The Annex at The Chelsea,1,Worst experience ever!!!!!,"I am not the kind of person who would write reviews, but this time I have to, this is the worst place I've ever stayed in my life, the room smelled, was too mosit and had a lot of small flies. Overall everything is just disgusting, Worst experience ever!!!!!"
The Annex at The Chelsea,1,Over 30? Stay away!,"Two positives: the front desk staff and the lobby. ALL downhill from there. Reservations did not confirm booking with Hotels.com so I had to wait at the front desk for 45 minutes while they sorted that out--the staff who helped me were very apologetic and helpful, however. The room and the annex in general is one of the worst places I've ever stayed. From the stench of the hallway to the dilapidated condition of the room, the free WiFi with no connection, and the balcony with its rickety railing and beautiful view of the parking garage and liquor store next door, permeated by the sounds of drunken kids in the hallways all night long and the cacophony of constant EMS and police sirens that never seemed to stop. If you're over 30, you DO NOT want to stay here. EVER. I will never stay here again--for the same money you can stay at the EconoLodge next door--certainly no better, but how could it be worse"
The Annex at The Chelsea,5,Great Interior Renovations and Very Comfortable!,The Interior Renovations and design are very nice. Very comfortable and quite.
The Annex at The Chelsea,1,"Very, very disappointed with this dump","I've heard such great things about the Chelsea, but their Annex is a dump. It really is. My bathroom was filthy. Neither my bathroom light nor my entryway light worked- we just had to use lamps. The room smelled like smoke or a gross cleaning agent, I couldn't tell. The walls are paper thin- I could hear a casual conversation in the room adjacent to ours. Even the elevator had 3 holes in its walls! Great location to Tropicana, but we won't stay there again."
The Annex at The Chelsea,1,"NOT shabby chic, just shabby","NOT shabby chic, just shabby. We had stayed at the Chelsea in the past and expected the Annex to be at least similar. But it was more like a downgraded, poorly maintained motel 6 trading on the good name of the Chelsea. Check in took 25 minutes waiting in line. The first room had high basement type windows (that were broken and didn't lock) looking over the roof where the air handlers were. The second room had a broken lock on the patio door. The patio was flooded, the dresser was chipped, stained, and drawers wouldn't stay closed, the bathroom door was water damaged at the bottom and stained, the bathroom floor was stained and dirty. Both rooms we saw were shabby and desperately in need of upgrades. The elevator floor was damaged and missing tiles, the restaurant downstairs (which was cute and hip in the past) is now old and shabby also. Not worth the money. As it is now, I would not recommend this hotel at all."
The Annex at The Chelsea,2,Chelsea Annex is somewhere I would not recommend!,"Our stay was mediocre at best! There is CHELSEA and Chelsea ANNEX. We had the ANNEX, and it was in poor condition. Furniture was far from nice, front desk and lobby gave you a very good first impression. The people at the desk were nice. One block from the beach, which was huge for me. Paid parking at 10 a day in a lot about 1.5 blocks away, or, 15 a day got valet. The elevator was very rough to ride. There was a small, but nice, pool. No coffee maker, no microwave, no mini-frig, ices machine did not work very well. Out air conditioning was set at 50* and it was so hot in there, especially for sleeping. The maintenance man said it couldn't get any cooler because it ran on cold water, and the water wasn't cold! If you are in AC to gamble, or go to the beach, this is fine to use the beaten down bathroom, or lay your head on a pillow. We won't be guests here again!"
The Annex at The Chelsea,1,Chelsea Annex should be embarrassed charging for rooms,"I heard positive things about the Chelsea hotel and booked a room for my anniversary in the Annex. I had no idea that this was a dingy, dirty motel connected to the the actual Chelsea hotel. We paid over 500 for 2 nights so it was not exactly a budget option. The room was the worst I have ever experienced.... More"
The Annex at The Chelsea,2,American Horror Story,The Chelsea itself seemed very nice even thought I didn't stay in a room there. As you walk through the Chelsea and into the Annex you get a totally different feel. It goes from semi-upscale to the creepy part of the hotel in American Horror Story. The beat up squeaky elevators to dimly lit hallways and the sketchy bright red lights on every floor it screamed AHS. On the positive side the price was great for a Friday night and it was just a really short walk to the Trop. Next time I would pay the few extra dollars and stay at the regular Chelsea not the Annex.
The Annex at The Chelsea,3,Nice looking is all it is,"I booked the at the Annex, bad idea from the start. Twice I went back the the desk because my key will not work. I was upgraded to the nicer side where one of the pillow case had a hole and there was a bad smell. Stayed there before and this was the worst. Don't think I will be going back there for a while."
The Annex at The Chelsea,5,Bday party stay,stayed for a birthday party on the 26th DEC. SAL at the front desk was amazing!!!!! he is so sweet and his service was completely very welcoming. Anything we needed or had questions about SAL was the guy to go to. he knew all the area asked what we liked and made sure our car was there without waiting. All others at the front desk were not as professional and were not courteous. there was a big difference in service. SAL made it feel like we were in Vegas very professional. I will be coming back again ONLY if SAL is there. ME and my Husband luv the place. Thank you SAL!!!!
The Annex at The Chelsea,1,Worst hotel ever in AC,Our stay was very bad . It started off with waiting to check in for an hour. Then when we got to our room our bed sheets had a whole in it and not to mention our Toilet would not flush . When I went down to complain about it the front deal receptionist had an attitude . For Over 200 a night I would expect to be treated better and the hotel to be updated . I would never ever say here again .
The Annex at The Chelsea,2,Not worth the money,Not the best place we have stayed at in Atlantic City but it was the worse. Rooms had a moldy smell. The first night we stayed there a fight broke out in the hallway. The second night another fight broke out. Now I understand the hotel can't control that but to a certain extent I feel like the annex just... More
The Annex at The Chelsea,4,Great Stay,The stay overall was great but the only downfall was the WIFI connection was terrible.
Eden Roc Inn & Suites,4,"Clean, Convenient and Comfy","Really nice stay. Clean, modern room, comfy bed, good channels, great location (15 min walk from Disneyland/CA Adventure), but a very high security deposit of 100. A lot of money for someone if they don't know beforehand."
Eden Roc Inn & Suites,5,"Looks all new, close to Disney, and low price, with good parking","I booked last min, the night before. It showed Family Suite.

Eden Roc Inn & Suites,3,A basic hotel walking distance to Disney,"Check in took several minutes because the hotel clerk was having trouble with the guest before us.

Eden Roc Inn & Suites,5,"Simple, Clean, & Convenient","Great remodel, rooms were super clean and well cared for and the lobby was nice. Perfect for trips to Disney parks."
Eden Roc Inn & Suites,4,I liked it,"I was in town on business at the convention center, which is walking distance. This is a good place to stay, even for those visiting the Disney parks nearby. This is motel type place but renovated to modern standards with good fixtures. 2 Queen bedrooms are very spacious and clean. No breakfast here but it is close to many restaurants."
Eden Roc Inn & Suites,4,Convenient,Good bang for the buck. Nice sized room.
Eden Roc Inn & Suites,2,Awkward setup,This place was loud and had the most awkward set up. It made it very difficult to rest. Disney on 4 hours of sleep kinda sucks. The place was pretty clean.
Eden Roc Inn & Suites,4,Great price for Disney,Clean room. Great price at 162 a night. Two beds offset so our son was out of the way while sleeping. Clean rooms and refurbished. Close to Disneyland. And my son said he caught a Charmander in Pokemon so he's happy. Great hotel for the price and proximity to Disneyland.
Eden Roc Inn & Suites,5,Great find near Disney,This is a great hotel walking distance to Disneyland friendly staff clean rooms great price will stay again

The pool was great and well used. We didn't realise until our final morning that breakfast was complimentary - perhaps guests could be informed on check-inn. I also loved the guest laundry. Overall I would... More
Park Vue Inn,5,Perfect for Dinseyland visit,"Nice hotel, friendly staff, clean rooms, good included breakfast, nice pool and VERY close to the parks (5 minutes walk). Can totally recommend. We had the suite, and it was perfect for a family of five."
Park Vue Inn,4,Our second time. We love Park Vue!,"Love this place. Fantastic housekeeping service, comfy beds, free parking, free cookies, coffee and lemonade in the lobby most of the day, free breakfast BUT the BEST part is the proximity to the park! We could literally see the crosswalk to the main entrance to Dland from our room! No kidding. the ONLY complaint I have is the air conditioning... More"
Park Vue Inn,3,Right Across Disney's Entrance,"Picked this hotel because of its best location right across Disney's gate. Room was just fine, not spotless and a bit tired but we could sleep well for 2 nights. Good breakfast. The on-site Cold Stone ice cream was yummy and having I-HOP next to the hotel was a plus. At the time of our stay the rate was quite... More"
Park Vue Inn,5,This is truly my home away from home,"This is truly my home away from home. Good complimentary breakfast that holds my family off until lunch. Breakfast includes waffles, muffins, toast, scrambled eggs, bacon or sausage, potatoes, biscuit and gravy depending on day, fruit, yogurt, hard boil eggs, and cereal. Everyone is really friendly. I have been going here for years and stay 5-6 times a year. The... More"
Holiday Inn Anaheim-Resort Area,3,Decent hotel close to Disneyland,"The rooms were clean and nice. They were renovating the restaurant when we visited, but the food was good with excellent staff and good prices. The pool area was okay. Good place for families with young children. Quiet surroundings and easy access to Disneyland with the bus shuttle right outside the hotel. Hotel staff was very friendly and service minded.... More"
Holiday Inn Anaheim-Resort Area,4,Ideal For Disney,After a long journey across town we turned up all hot and bothered but when we walked into the hotel lobby we were greeted with a warm smile and welcome.

Holiday Inn Anaheim-Resort Area,3,Clean,"This isn't a high end property by any means, but it is clean, reasonably priced, and a short drive to local attractions. It's right off highway 5, so it's easy to get off and back onto freeway. Parking is a standard open lot, no fee. The main negative is they have the window like air conditioner units that are noisy...

Holiday Inn Anaheim-Resort Area,4,Enjoyed the trip,"Had a great trip. Motel was nice, clean, and comfortable. Food was ok. Taxi/ car to disneyland was only 15 each way. I think the bus was slightly cheaper."
Pacific Inn,2,Dirty but cheap,"We had difficulty finding this motel. It is closer to Knott's Berry Farm over Disneyland. The check in lobby smelled of urine. The hotel does not have a lift of any sort for the second floor, therefore consider this if climbing stairs is an issue....More"
Quality Inn & Suites Anaheim Maingate,1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Very old hotel that caters to low class clientele. Being near Disneyland, this hotel is a fly trap to families who cannot afford something nicer. There were children running around all hours of the night and day and the hotel staff did nothing to keep them quiet. Our first night there we had a family above us with small children who kept running around the room and because of the noise we assume they were jumping off the furniture. We complained to the hotel staff and nothing was done to stop this. It continued until well after 11 PM and night.The second night we were there, we had a family with small children next door to us and it was apparent from what we saw, they were there with other families who also had small children. They were kept there doors open and the children were running up and down the balcony with no supervision. At 6 AM the next morning, someone was pounding on the door next to us very loudly and yelling fire, fire, fire. It woke up the people next to us so they opened there door and began to play loud rap music until about approximately 9 AM when we left. We were on the second floor near the office and all of this activity was extremely loud and had to have been heard at the office, but no action was taken to stop it.I would never stay at this hotel again!!!!Thank you for taking the time to write us a review. We are extremely sorry for the experience you had at our hotel. This is not something normal. I am also suprised our staff did not address the issue immediately. W hope you will give us another chance in the future to win back your business."

Excellent breakfast, excellent rooms, amenities decor location Best Western Hotels should be your number one choice. Thank you for staying at Best Western Envoy Inn, Atlantic City NJ. We are thrill to hear that you really enjoyed your stay. Yes we have fresh waffles for breakfast along with hard boiled eggs, sausage, many more items. Thank you for your feedback. It means a lot to us."
Best Western Envoy Inn,4,Nice stay.,"I booked this room for a concert my husband and I went to. We only needed the room one night but opted for the king suite. Rooms was great, breakfast was willing. You have to walk a little to get to places but if we could do it in the frigid AC air, anyone can. Highly reccomend!"
Best Western Envoy Inn,2,Don't stay Atlantic City NJ,"Best Western on Pacific Ave Atlantic City NJ was dirty, bad section of town, in fear of our families safety. Never again, I always stay at Best Westerns , never a problem, but stay away from this one."
Best Western Envoy Inn,1,Will never stay here again,"Service was terrible, could not get any one on the phone to ask questions, there was only one GSR in the lobby. the breakfast was cold, room was dirty, floor never vacuumed, only one bar of soap, only one set of towels of each size"
Best Western Envoy Inn,4,best deal for the price,"I wanted to stay overnight for the Air Show there were 600,000 people in AC, so I knew we would have to pay top dollar to stay anywhere. All the Casinos were booked and all the board walk properties were also booked with the exception of the 2 star Days Inn which wanted 280 per night. I decided to go for the best western 129 even though I had read some questionable reviews. We were suprised at how nice the hotel looked. It was clean nice tiled bathroom new looking carpet on hall floors and in the room. The AC in our room worked fine and was on when we got there. There was a nice sized frige, coffee machine and blow dryer. The halls were warm because windows were open (no AC on). We had a great complimentary breakfast in the morning including fresh make your own belgium waffels, bagles, pastries, muffins juices and coffee. Staff was friendly and helpful. Being a city girl I was definately on my guard walking the one long block from the boardwalk at night 1AM but it was well lit and had several clubs and resturants along the way. It is also centrally located to all the Casinos and the beach has a boardwalk entryway with a rinse off shower and public bathrooms."
Best Western Envoy Inn,5,Very nice!!!,"Staff was very friendly and helpful!!! Good location, couple blocks from outlet shops and 3min walk to the beach and board walk. Neighborhood is not the best at night. But it is a good place to stay overall."
Best Western Envoy Inn,1,Beware,"This hotel had an ant problem, was extremely loud, we found hair on our towels, and someone else was given the key to our room at midnight. NEVER AGAIN! We stayed at several Best Westerns on our vacation, this was by far the WORST."
Best Western Envoy Inn,4,"Surprising very nice, clean and close to most things.",I was a little worried from the outside and the lobby but I was very happy with the room. The breakfast was nothing to write home about. The proximity to everything I wanted to do was good. I would stay again.
Best Western Envoy Inn,4,Comfortable and Cozy near the Boardwalk,"This best western is the next best thing to the casino maybe even equal comfort that's close to the boardwalk. I have been staying at this location for years. I even have a favorite room. They since have remodeled and it's really nice modern decor. It's generally inexpensive, but can sometimes be the same rate as the casinos because of its popularity. I always enjoy my stay and it's close to everything. One block from the boardwalk. There is a seven eleven across the street that has everything. There is a rite aid, liquor store, restaurants and laundromat few steps away. Highly recommend this location and nice staff in the lobby."
Best Western Envoy Inn,4,Good night sleep,"The hotel did not seem like it was in a good neighbourhood but the rooms were nice and comfortable. Breakfast was good but served in plastic plates and cutlery. The breakfast buffet had a nice choice of food, yoghurts and similar. The check in was easy and fast, staff was nice."
Best Western Envoy Inn,4,Pleasantly surprised,"The outside of the hotel is not the most inviting. However, the rooms were very clean and the staff was very helpful. Other reviews say this hotel is not in the best area. No area of Atlantic City is really considered a great area in my opinion so don't let that dissuade you from staying at this hotel."
Best Western Envoy Inn,3,One step above seedy,"Was looking for a clean place to crash for the night , had a business meeting the next day. There was an old, tenament building smell in the building. You can tell they try to keep it clean. We met some hookers outside congregating in front of the entrance."
Best Western Envoy Inn,4,Sharleen's Review,"I have stayed at this hotel many times and never a problem. Always have an enjoyable stay. The hotel is situated right near the boardwalk, the outlets to shop and the casinos of course all within walking distance and if you want to take the Jitney, the stop is right in front of the hotel."
Best Western Envoy Inn,3,No Complaints,"We decided Saturday morning to go to A.C. for the night (from North Jersey)... looked online for a hotel that was reasonably close to boardwalk and casinos and priced below saturday night casino rates... this hotel fit that criteria... 2 blocks from boardwalk... essentially between resorts and ballys... good location (although other reviews are right about strip bars on street between boardwalk and hotel)... hotel is older and no frills - but clean, comfortable (air conditioner in our 4th floor room worked great), and certainly adequate... i would certainly recommend this hotel as a reasonably priced place to spend an overnight"
Best Western Envoy Inn,3,My Stay HERE!,"The room wasn't all that I was led to believe it was. According to Ali, it was the best room in the hotel and it was big and spacious enough to accommodate myself and my 4 friends. I was celebrating my birthday. The location in proximity to the boardwalk was good but the neighborhood was kind of shady. The room itself was pretty big but the beds were small (they were full-sized beds), what hotel still has those It's usually queen or king. With that being said, we were kind of uncomfortable sleeping two to a bed. The room itself didn't get that cool as the air only circulated in the area where the air conditioning was and didn't seem to distribute throughout the entire room.On a positive note, the night clerk, I believe his name was Mahadi was extremely accommodating and attentive and we as a group appreciated that."
Best Western Envoy Inn,3,The hotel was alright,"The hotel room was decent and cute and clean! A non smoking floor as well which was nice since we had a baby with us or we would not have stayed there' We were passing through and chose the BW!The neighbourhood was sketchy as hell and we didn't feel like safest! When we got into the elevator-it sure smelt like someone just smoked a joint in there! ( not the hotels fault) Breakfast was ok, small room and super hot!bug a Nice lady working in there and helping out though! We slept well and had no issues"
Best Western Envoy Inn,3,Great location disappointing overall,"We had two nights this month at the Envoy. Upon arrival we were not happy with front desk staff attitude, followed by getting a smoking room despite having booked non-smoking. On return to the desk they could only get us two doubles non-smoking although we were there 15 mins past 3pm and I am a Gold Elite BW member.Parking was good, secure and very handy.Later in the stay we experienced more rude front desk, and saw other guests experience it too.The remainder of hotel staff seemed friendly but spoke little English.Breakfast (included) was fine but they only would put out so much.... even though they had reserves and therefore one had to go very early if one wanted any choice.Location was fine - a block of the boardwalk - but nighttime ventures out showed the neighbourhood to be somewhat rough on the road to bettering maybeAC was ok which was good because it was hot!"
Best Western Envoy Inn,5,"Nice room, good value","spacious, clean room, relatively close to boardwalk, a 7eleven across the street... not prime location (you feel that Atlantic city is not in its best days), but good value (even with the charges for parking) as it is walking distance to boardwalk/beach and the room is nice"
Best Western Envoy Inn,4,Nice rooms short way from the boardwalk,"The rooms were comfy and big. Not many minutes from the boardwalk or city centre. On the negative side the surrounding area is a bit gritty, but that is a AC problem, so you really cant blame the hotel."
Best Western Seven Seas,1,It was an horrible trip,Seriously security is too bed!! Some one stole my stuff in my car!!
Best Western Seven Seas,4,nice hotel near downtown SD,"Near downtown sd, fashion shopping mall, easy access to highways. Beds semi comfortable. Fine for overnight lodging."
Best Western Seven Seas,5,Nice place and very affordable,We stay here everytime we're in town for the Supercross and it's a really nice place to stay! The room is really clean and the beds are really comfortable. We'll definitely continue staying here when in town.
Best Western Seven Seas,3,"So, so hotel.","Let's start wth the positives. The location is good, easy to get anywhere. The price was good. The front desk was quick and professional, not super friendly, but professional. That's about it for positives. The hotel is extremely dated. The beds are tiny and uncomfortable. The room is in disrepair, broken lights, rusty doorways, loose outlets. We found a nasty... More"
Best Western Seven Seas,3,Location and WIFI were great!,"Free parking, Free Wifi. Relative to other similar hotels of this calibre the price was approximately double that of what we were used to be paying. Location wise it was about 10-15 minutes to most sights in the San Diego area. Although rated as a 3 star it felt closer to a 2 star or a Motel in decor and... More"
Best Western Seven Seas,4,Staycation,"Room was quiet. Pool and hot tub available, which was a nice perk."
Best Western Seven Seas,3,Close to everything but watch the room type you rent,"The staff were very friendly and helpful, but the hotel itself is a hit or miss. Upon arrival, the room was very small, crowded, outdated uncomfortable. Not what you would expect from a BW Plus hotel. We unpacked most of our stuff and went for dinner, only to come back to discover the bathroom had not been cleaned and... More"
Best Western Seven Seas,5,Last Minute Trip,"We were thrilled to find availability at this hotel, as we booked it the week before our trip.

Best Western Seven Seas,5,Good place to stay,"Very nice room, comfortable bed with good HD TV. Nice amenities and also good if you have children with you. Rooms are quiet and well maintained. It is right off the interstate and short drive to almost everything you could be looking for in San Diego."
Best Western Seven Seas,4,Nice Place,"Nice hotel, great location, easy access to freeway. Pretty tropical landscaping, really nice pool fitness area. Front desk staff, friendly. Beds comfy, clean, fridge, table. Only issue seemed to be a funny smell that came and went the AC, took long for room to cool the lower the temp, unit would make a loud noise. Not sure if smell coming from the actual unit."
Best Western Seven Seas,5,Awesome staff.....mostly. Great hotel otherwise!,"front desk was awesome, housekeeping was awesome, the only thing was the last night of our stay, the security guard asked to check our room out for absolutely no reason we were about to go to bed and were being quiet...we had the same 3 people we had had the whole time and he said interesting and walked out, nothing else happened and we went to bed....VERY strange...other than that I loved this hotel and we will be retuning!!!"
Best Western Seven Seas,5,It Looks Like Hawaii,"Ok, I know it's San Diego, Hotel Circle, but this hotel makes you feel like you're on an island somewhere far away. The landscaping is lush and almost tropical. It's far larger than it looks from the street. The rooms are a bit small, but they're still confortable with all the amenities except microwave...but I didn't miss that. And I... More"

Best Western Seven Seas,5,San Diego Stay,"This is a terrific hotel. I make it a point to stay here every trip to San Diego. The grounds are beautiful and the amenities are great! Ask about the PG program. The PG lounge is awesome! The staff is eager to help in any way,"
Best Western Seven Seas,1,No sleep,"Did not sleep.. sadly when we arrived this hotel was directly the msin hotel affected by the construction and its crew, that was performed during the whole night, made our short trip to the beach a sadly terrible one"
Best Western Seven Seas,3,Ok,Not bad.. Room is nice. I asked for a Bottom floor because my knee. I got room 107. Approximately 20yards from parking.. But directly across from pool. I dragged all my gear (I'm active duty military ) up a set of 2 steps . Oh well right .. You get what you pay for
Best Western Seven Seas,2,Insects,"I guess they don't care about the little critters that creep around the room. We informed the front desk and all they said was, hum. We usually have the rooms sprayed! Found two centipedes and spiders crawling around."
Best Western Seven Seas,2,Slow speed Internet also need refurbishing,The internet was so slow that my data kicked in. That I could be OK with just a nuisance. I got back to my room around 9pm and wanted to take a bath. The stopper on the tub did not work so could not do that. I think it is funny how things that are so minor do not work... More
Best Western Seven Seas,5,Excellent Motel--Stay here--Look No further!,"I was very apprehensive about staying here having read some reviews and have come to the conclusion that only complainers write reviews.

I would gladly stay here again... More"

Rodeway Inn San Diego Near Qualcomm Stadium,3,"ONE DIRECTION, San Diego!","My daughter and I came to San Diego for a concert. I booked my stay but when I arrived to check-in, the hotel did not have a record of my reservation. I had my confirmation email in hand but the hotel clerk would only tell me she didn't have anything and said I needed to contact the Hotels.com. I think that I would have rated this hotel higher if perhaps she had offered to call them for my seeing as how I had my confirmation email in my hand and it would have just been that extra customer service effort. I did contact Hotels.com and they resent my reservation and the hotel upgraded me to suite for the inconvenience. There was no apology from the hotel which I thought would have been appropriate. My hotel key kept getting deactivated because my cell phone would get too close to it so that was a hassle, having to take it to the front desk to get activated. My room had a slight odor in it but after a day or so I didn't notice it. Overall my room was clean and it was quiet. It suited my needs but wasn't anything extraordinary or spectacular."
Rodeway Inn San Diego Near Qualcomm Stadium,4,Good choice!,"Perfect for one night visit to tour SDSU. Room was clean, looked newly renovated and very comfortable. Not sure I'd hang out at the pool, though. Double queen room was good for 2 people would have been tight with family of 4. Staff was friendly and courteous. Breakfast was fresh and plentiful. Centrally located to all attractions. Would definitely stay again."
Rodeway Inn San Diego Near Qualcomm Stadium,4,A nice place to stay,"The personnel at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. The room was a whole lot better than I was expecting. The bathroom was a bit tight, the shower/tub was a good size tho."
Rodeway Inn San Diego Near Qualcomm Stadium,1,Poor Customer Service Practices,"We were invited to the wedding of a close family member in San Diego with only 3 weeks notice. A friend got us two rooms at Rodeway Inn Qualcomm at a discounted rate to help us with travel expenses. We received our confirmations 15 days prior to check in.On the very morning we left for San Diego, we received a phone call from the manager of Rodeway Inn Qualcomm telling us we were not eligible for the discounted rooms, and our reservations had been cancelled. There was no offer to keep the reservations at the standard rate the reservations had simply been cancelled and the rooms were no longer available. When asked why he would do this on the day we were due to check in, the manager basically told us he did it because he could.We understand that hotel policies may limit the availability of discounted rooms, but we should have been notified earlier so we could make other arrangements. We set off to San Diego with no accommodations. This was certainly the worst customer service we've ever experienced at any lodging establishment."
Holiday Inn Express San Diego Sea World - Beach Area,5,Best value hotel!!!,"We were greeted by Yadira and she was very accommodating and very friendly, we felt at home right from the get go. The room was very clean. The hotel staff made sure all our needs were met. We all had very satisfied tummies with their free breakfast. We'll definitely be staying here again!!!"
Holiday Inn Express San Diego Sea World - Beach Area,5,Excellent,This hotel exceeded all my expectations. It is conveniently located and a short drive to everything San Diego has to offer. Marcia and Elisa at the front desk were incredibly helpful and friendly making my stay all the better. They went out of their way to answer any questions and make recommendations as to what to see.

Grande Colonial La Jolla,5,Great Location!,"My boyfriend and I had a most excellent stay here! We checked in on this past Sunday and stayed until this Tuesday. From our arrival we were greeted by Benny, the Bell Captain who along with the rest of his Bell staff took care of us from go. We were allowed to check in early to a Junior Suite 102 which had a beautiful view of the Ocean located at the end of the street. Our suite was located out in a building separate from the main hotel and off the pool area. Just around the corner from the front desk. Our suite was large had a separate sitting area with a flat screen TV and a small fridge under the counter which had plenty of cabinet space. 2 sinks one in the bathroom and one in the counter where the fridge was. Luxurious Bathrobes that I ABSOLUTELY wanted (will put on my birthday list :) Bellman Dan scooted us over to a local restaurant in the hotel golf cart... they will offer to take you just about anywhere and will also return to pick you up.rnrnService at the Front Desk was exceptional, friendly, courteous and consistently above and beyond helpful! I commend who ever does the hiring here because they have done a Fantastic job of hiring people that either love their job and sincerely want you to enjoy your stay or they do a great job in faking it LOLrnrnHotel is located within walking distance of all the quaint shops, it has it's own restaurant but we were not impressed with the menu... we did however take advantage of the happy hour deal the appetizers were tasty and 1/2 off as was their signature cocktail Orange Crush. The day before the boyfriend ordered a Cloud 9 that was the BOMB! and I got my favorite Lemon Drop both were flavorful but I must say this was the only place I was not impressed with the Bar Service it took a while for our appetizers to arrive and they were not as attentive as the rest of the hotel staff had been /rnrnAll and all a very nice place to drop in during the week we get the impression that weekends here (like most places) are a zoo. Parking on the street down the hill is free so don't spend the 22.00 on valet just find a spot on the street.rnrnRespectfully Reviewedrn"
Residence Inn San Diego Central,5,Such a great hotel!,"We had a wonderful 5 day stay here! We enjoyed everything about this hotel.

Fairfield Inn Philadelphia Airport,4,Good hotel for the price,"Room was clean and the service was very good, the continental breakfast with a lot of stuff to choose. Good hotel for the price, only one think I see they need a bigger garbage cans in the room for families with small kids."
Fairfield Inn Philadelphia Airport,3,Stopover at Philly,Our flight got in late so we needed a place to stay. They sent a shuttle to pick us up at 12:30 AM. They gave us a double bed for my little one and had breakfast in the morning. It's clean with good staff. Plenty of parking. We also got a late checkout.

Hilton Garden Inn Napa,4,Very good choice in Napa valley,"Second time for us in this hotel, and as before very nice place. Location is excellent to visit the Napa valley area. Centrally located to visit the wineries and near the downtown area. Staff is very nice and helpful. Accomodations very good. We had an issue the second night where we requested a change of room because we had a very noisy and rowdy family in the room above us. The type of inconsiderate people existent in todays society. It is not the hotels fault. Vincent, in the front desk, was very helpful in getting us another room in the 3rd floor.It pleases us to know you had a good time while visiting our hotel, thank you very much for taking the time to share your review. You are welcome back anytime!Hilton Garden Inn Napa Management"

NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,4,"Newer Hotel, Great Customer Service, Quiet","We had a corner suite on the 8th floor this past weekend and were pleasantly surprised by the large size of the room and bathroom. Upon check-in, we were told that the pool and roof bar were on the 9th floor. We had concerns about possible noise only being one floor down, but our stay was very quiet throughout the weekend. Pluses:The room was very clean and nicely furnished. Customer service was excellent. We called the front desk to request a fridge for medication and it was delivered within 5 minutes. We also saw a couple gift items in the gift store early on Sunday morning before our flight out but the shop had not opened yet. The manager was kind enough to open the store for us an hour beforehand so that we could make our purchases. The hotel is only a short 5-10 mins walk from the French Quarter. High quality, soft toilet paper and high quality toiletries and linens provided. Nice brushed nickel finishes in the bathroom. Complimentary water in the room.Minor Issues:King-sized bed was a bit lumpy and sagged except for the middle. We would have preferred a smoother, firmer mattress. The power buttons and volume buttons on both remote controls for the TVs did not function. The next day, we finally found the joystick button on the bottom middle frame of each TV to control the volume and power. We did not use the pool, but it is very small.We are delighted you enjoyed your time at NOPSI. Let us know when you are travelling back to NOLA and we will ensure your stay is most memorable.

My spouse is a lifetime Marriott Platinum member so we have had our fair share of hotel stays. The service and hospitality was amazing. The staff was courteous without feeling stuffy...the best way to describe them was authentic with a large does of Southern hospitality and they were all wonderful.They upgraded us to a better room which comprised of a wrap around view. The upgrade was complimentary even though they were fully booked. Two thumbs up and what a wonderful way to kick-off my birthday.The hotel bed is amazing. I described it as feeling hugged but not hot. I received the best sleep and my spouse said the same. I'm a side sleeper and he's a back sleeper so it's shocking that we both like the mattress.The bed was so comfortable that I emailed the hotel to get the make of the mattress and will order it for our own home.We frequented the lobby bar and the drinks were on point.I don't recall the name of my drink but it reminded me of salty plum but our bartender described it as vinegary. Personally, I thought it was well-balanced. The Frenchman was also well-made here. The rooftop bar was a scene but not compared to Orange County or LA. Much less pretentious and the skyline was pleasant.As others have mentioned, the hotel is not in the middle of the action but walking distance to Bourbon St and many of the best local restaurants (GW Fins being my fav for the grilled oysters and desserts).Bottom line, I would stay here again the next time we are in NOLA.Sara, thank you so much for choosing to stay at NOPSI! Its wonderful to learn that you had such a fun and memorable 40th birthday with us. We love making all occasions special, and were delighted to have won you over. A terrace room overlooking the city certainly provides an unforgettable experience. We hope you and your husband will make visiting us an annual birthday tradition so that we may treat you to more pleasant surprises!Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,5,Wonderful Hotel and Perfect Holiday Stay!,"Our holiday stay at the NOPSI was PERFECT! The hotel and the architecture are spectacular. The staff, from housekeeping to management, was professional, efficient, polite and friendly. The service was just as one would expect from a luxury hotel. I can't say enough about the bartenders at all 3 bars. They were knowledgeable mixologists, friendly and efficient. The view from the rooftop bar is grand and so is the atmosphere. The lobby bar is beautiful and the live music in the evenings was a wonderful treat. Room service was delivered quicker than anticipated and was delicious! Our breakfasts were first class! The 3 egg omelet Pontchartrain, Porchetta Hash and Eggs, Pecan Belgian Waffles and 1/2 Ruby Grapefruit Brle were the best room service meals I believe my husband and I have ever had for breakfast. The room service wait staff was polite and friendly. Although we did not dine at Public Service during this stay, we have in the past and found the food and service to be exemplary. Christmas morning we were greeted with a stocking hanging on our door. The stocking was filled with fresh fruit, candy and baked goods. What a wonderful surprise! The accommodations were beautiful and comfortable. My husband is generally very uncomfortable sleeping in hotel beds and lounging on hotel furniture, but he was very comfortable during our stay at the NOPSI. He was so pleased, that he has already booked the hotel for a return business trip in the near future. Love this beautiful hotel in my favorite city! Can't wait to return.Sharon, Thank you for sharing your wonderful review on TripAdvisor. I am thrilled that you enjoyed a little lagniappe on Christmas morning as well as phenomenal service throughout your stay. It is an honor to be your hotel of choice in New Orleans. Our team looks forward to welcoming you again on your next visit. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,5,Luxury NOLA Hotel,"After being on a 7 day cruise that left out of New Orleans, we decided to stay and explore the beautiful city of New Orleans. We were with a group of friends who were staying at the NOPSI Hotel, so we decided to book a room there too, and boy were we glad we did. This hotel is virtually brand new, opening in July 2017. The NOPSI Hotel building formerly served as the headquarters of the citys power and transportation company, New Orleans Public Service Inc. Its absolutely amazing how this hotel has been transformed into such a gorgeous and luxurious hotel. As we pulled up to the hotel, we were warmly greeted by the bellmen, Bolton and Will. These gentlemen took great care of us and our belongings. What a great feeling to be welcomed so warmly the minute one arrives at a hotel! The rooms have the most comfortable mattresses, finest linens and all the amenities you could ever want, including robes. They bathroom is quite exquisite, with its grand two door entrance, marble countertops, double sink, and oversized shower.If so inclined, you can choose to indulge in an on sight spa service at the NOPSI Spa. There is an on sight restaurant, multiple bars, one in the grand atrium and one in the restaurant area. Be sure to check out Above the Grid, the rooftop pool and bar. Above the Grid is open to hotel guests and locals, providing everyone with an extraordinary view of the citys skyline. NOPSI Hotel is about a 1 mile from Bourbon Street. Its situated in a perfect location, walking distance from virtually all local attractions. We walked back and forth to Bourbon Street many times during our short stay. On sight parking is available for a fee. You should contact the hotel directly for daily rate charges. Pinot, Thank you for sharing your NOPSI Hotel experience. We are delighted that you enjoyed your stay. It has been exciting for us to finally share NOPSI with our guests. Whether you are dining at one our restaurants or relaxing in one of our well-appointed rooms, we are here to make your stay memorable. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,5,Class Act! Loved the Building!,"The hotel was new and fresh and loved the fact the old, city, utilities building was repurposed and refreshed. The staff was friendly and everyone helpful. The location was far enough away from the French Quarter to be quiet but still within a 10 minute walk. Class Act all the way!It's great to hear from you and I'm glad you had a fantastic stay at our hotel. Your comments to location and staff are gratefully received and we hope to welcome you back soon.Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,5,Great hotel for Marci Gras!,"Close to parade routes, walking distance to the French Quarter but not in the middle of it it! Nice roof top bar and pool and view of the New Orelans areas. Would definitely stay hear again when New Orleans."
NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,2,OH. HELL. NO.,"Unacceptable, unprofessional behavior.1. Couldn't get into room because I wasn't on the reservation. 2. Person let into room who wasn't on the reservation.3. Unreliable housekeeping.4. Double-charged for entire stay... WHEN I WASN'T EVEN ON THE RESERVATION.So, to begin... My friend PREPAID with her card for a room for us to share, but requested that my name be added to the reservation since I would arrive in NOLA hours before her. There's a whole email trail to prove they agreed, had my name spelled correctly, etc. I arrived, and they're like who are you I'm tired. I've been traveling. I need to shower, but no. I can't get into the room until hours later when my friend lands and gets it sorted from her Uber. I check us in using my card for incidentals, saying they'd only put a 50 hold on my card if we charged something to the room (we didn't). My friend arrives three hours later, but basically gets into our room about 15 minutes after I do. Once she's there, she tells me a pretty funny story. Her bf and his friends had another room, and even though he never put them on the reservation at all, they gave them keys! I had documentation and couldn't get into my room, and they, complete strangers for all the hotel knows, just waltzed into theirs! A huge security issue!The room itself was nice enough, and so was the pool however, the pool bar closed at random times despite having official posted hours. The bartenders were rude, as was most of the hotel staff (except for the doormen, who were delightful). Our room was only cleaned half the days of our stay. Housekeeping didn't replenish the toiletries when they did clean the room, and with two women, we obviously ran out of shampoo. When we called the front desk, around 10pm, they said they'd run out! At 11pm they came with a bag (and I mean garbage bag) full of.... lotion Because that helps. So both my friend and I showered without washing our hair, only to have housekeeping show up again at 2AM IN THE MORNING, banging on the door, with one bottle of shampoo that I guess they found. Not only was it late, but it was LATE.And now the worst part, to top it all off: Remember when I wasn't even on the reservation Yeah, they charged my credit card on file for a temporary hold FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. After my friend HAD ALREADY PREPAID. They got their before we even stepped in the door, and then double charged a completely different credit card with a completely different name. Yeah, no. You can deal with my credit card company thanks. I'm giving them two stars instead of one because the doormen were so incredibly nice. The nicest I've ever met. They should all get bonuses.And some additional minor points:Doormen: SO NICE! I LOVED THEM!Housekeeping: Good job cleaning WHEN they cleaned (but didn't restock soaps)Pool: Small but really nice, great viewBars: Rude, closed for no reasonFood: GreatBed: ComfortableBathroom: AwesomeNoise level: LOUD but it's not the soundproofing. It's the crazy loud fan/vent.Location: GREATOverall cleanliness: GREATThank you for taking a moment to share your review on TripAdvisor. Your candid feedback is truly valuable. I am disappointed to learn of issues you encountered during your stay as well as the service that should have been executed flawlessly. My apologies for your experience and I hope you will allow us another opportunity to serve you. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,3,Not yet,"Hotel work in progress. Pretty enough and nice roof top bar. Tiny gym. Terrible WiFi and worse service and effort in dining room. Its not a great deal with these issues. If they care they can improve but not clear they do. Also my room was not clean until 6 on the day we checked in forcing us to wait 2 hours. Thank you for choosing NOPSI! We appreciate your feedback. I am disappointed to hear that service did not meet your expectations. If travels should bring you back, we would love the opportunity to demonstrate our service levels in the future.Warm Regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,1,Horrible,"I have never been treated so badly in my entire life. I have called this people so many times to ask questions regarding friends comin over for as me have in a lil get together. An every one of my questions where answered wrong cause they made it a point to ruin my night. My friends where not allowed to go to the public bar or swim they told me on the phone the was open til 11. once we got there they said it closed at 8 I guess it was cause we where black an they thought they where talkin to a white person on the phone. They said my guest where welcomed once they got there they stopped them from comin up once again guess it was cause we where black. I will never return to this hotel from hell again. An also they let people order drinks under your room number wit out gettin permission from the person the room is from wow is all I got to say.Dear Sasha, We strive to deliver an exceptional experience for our guests at NOPSI Hotel, but this evidently did not occur during your visit. We take very seriously any complaints of discrimination, any forms of which are not tolerated in our company.

NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,5,Beautiful New Orleans Hotel!,"We stayed at the NOPSI Hotel for the LSU game at the Dome. It was a wonderful surprise! It was an easy walk to the Dome from the hotel.

NOPSI Hotel New Orleans,5,Wonderful New Hotel - Stay Here!,"We recently spent three nights at The NOPSI in New Orleans. Nothing but good things to say. Beautiful first impression - absolutely gorgeous lobby! Extremely friendly and helpful staff - from the doormen, the front desk folks, the concierge - everyone! The location was an easy walk to the French Quarter but far enough away from the not so nice part. And the rooms were great - spotless, comfortable and large. Nice bars in the lobby and on the roof and also in the adjacent restaurant (which had a very good breakfast). All in all, A+!Frank, Thank you for visiting NOPSI Hotel. Our service professionals strive to make our guests feel at home from the moment they walk through the doors. We are honored that our service has earned your recommendation and look forward to welcoming you back in the near future. Warm regards, Ellen LeMaireGeneral Manager"
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,"Perfect location, helpful staff, nice room","This location is perfect: it's walking distance to the French Quarter and to the Business District, yet it's far enough away from the craziness of Bourbon Street that you can get some sleep, if that's your thing. Everyone is very friendly. Rooms are modern and comfortable. Nice shower. The bed was a tiny bit too soft for my liking, but it didn't tarnish my experience in the least.Thank you for taking the time to review your stay with us as we appreciate hearing how much you enjoyed our property and service provided. Sounds like our rooms and staff exceeded expectations which is our ultimate goal and know that our team will be commended for their efforts.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,Awsome Experience,"A little pricey, however the location and service was excellent. Breakfast is not the best, at least as a Diamond level is complementary. I highly recommend this property, location, staff and rooms are excellent. Thank you for taking the time to write this review of your stay and we are delighted to know you enjoyed almost everything about your stay. We are currently transitioning our restaurant and trying out some new items and processes, please know that the breakfast service will improve as this is a main priority.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,Staff made our anniversary!,"We were taken aback by the staff, especially Jalan who since we walked in took care of us. We felt like royalty! They secured a bottled of champagne and treats for our 22nd wedding anniversary ... so very kind! The hotel is lovely, a boutique stay with a Hilton flair. Its modern but not over the top. Very clean and very comfortable with a great rooftop bar. It is not in the French Quarter so beware we actually liked that as we know NOLA well. Surely a destination to be considered. Thank you for taking the time to write this wonderful review of your anniversary celebration at our hotel. We love to hear back when we not only meet but exceed expectations. Jalan is certainly a rising star on our staff and has been commended for his efforts in taking great care of you. It was our pleasure to have you as our guest and hope to have you back for another visit very soon.Sincerely,"

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",1,Go elsewhere for your NOLA stay!,"Toilet paper is like sandpaper. Billed for charges that even the staff can not explain and having to make numerous repeat calls to get corrected. A week later and STILL not corrected. If you stay, get your bill before you leave the property! Coffee was offered in lobby first day and then STOPPED Seems as if the restaurant is struggling and they wanted people to purchase coffee vs offer. Pitiful. One of the worst hotel stays I have had, especially from a Hilton. Location is not the best eitherThank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we apologize for any issues you encountered during your stay. Your feedback is very important to us and so please contact me directly to discuss further so that I can address accordingly.Regards,"
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",4,Trendy and Hip,"Very nicely decorated in retro fashion. Loved the steamer versus the traditional iron.Very friendly and accommodating staff.Although location is within walking distance to the French Quarter, would not recommend walking late at night. We found ourselves a bit turnaround when walking back from French Quarter. We stopped in at the Emergency Department of Tulane Hospital for directions who advised us that it was not safe to be walking in this area. They called us a cab despite the fare being very short (a few blocks). Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your experience. The comments of our guests are important for others to get a feel of our property and location.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,Great Stay,Staff was friendly... Clean room... great location... will definitely stay again. Right by the Superdome.. Not far from everything else. No ice machine on your floor but staff brings ice to ur room quickly. Again great stay.
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",4,Modern and funky,"We stayed here for 3 nights as part of a road trip! The reception staff were lovely and polite on check in! The rooms were comfortable, clean and very funky! The bathroom was amazing! However the toiletries were not replaced when the room was serviced daily. The walls were quite thin and we could hear the guy in the room next door! It wasnt horrendous and it didnt disturb us. It seemed to be very stylish but some of the finer points were missed. The upstairs bar was recommended to us on check in so we tried it out. We were really disappointed with the bar, it was a Monday night, and it was not busy. The staff seemed uninterested in us, we sat down and my dad went to the bar to ask a couple of questions, he was stood there for nearly 10 minutes, we decided to leave when eventually a member of staff spoke with him so we decided to stay. The first drink I wanted was a southern comfort, but they had none. Next I wanted a Gin and tonic but they had no tonic. In the end I had a cider which wasnt very nice. The bar staff continued to seem disinterested in us and we felt like a burden to them. It was nice sitting on the roof top and having a drink but that was the only bit of the experience we enjoyed. We did not use their car park because it was expensive, but it was in a good location for other car parks. We did not want to be in the middle of the French quarter and found that we enjoyed the 20 minute walk to get there from the hotel! It is in a good location for lots of breakfast stops as well. Hello Leah,Thank you for your stay with us. We are pleased to hear that your check in experience went well but we are sorry to hear there were some issues with housekeeping and the service you received at our roof top bar. These issues have been addressed with the team so that we may improve on this. We hope you will give us a chance to win you back as a guest."

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,Wonderful stay,"Had a fantastic stay at the Troubadour. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for restaurants. The hotel was clean and modern. The only negative was that the walls are very thin but didn't bother us too much. Everything else well surpassed my expectations. Thank you very much for the five star review!!! We love to hear that we exceeded just about all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests. Please know that our walls were actually built thicker than what was recommended for a hotel when we completed this renovation, may have been a case of noisy neighbors that we could always try to assist with once reported.We appreciate you staying with us and do hope to have you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,small and swanky,"stayed here the weekend of the Rock and Roll New Orleans marathon. The staff were all very friendly and accommodating. The hotel itself was gorgeous, comfortable rooms and huge bathrooms. My main reason for giving 5 stars was the breakfast and inspirational note that the staff put in my room the night before the race. What a great touch.The only thing I noticed that I didn't love was that I could hear the elevators moving all through the night. My room was right behind them though so I doubt this was a problem on the other side of the hotel. I will definitely stay here next time I am in town. :)We appreciate that you took a moment to share your experience. I'm very excited to hear you were so impressed during your trip to the Big Easy!

The rooftop bar is on the 17th floor looks out over the city with couches and sitting areas besides a big bar to sit at. Rooms were decorated nicely with a touch of orange as the signature color.

One stood out for me and was very helpful and fair. Her name is Sarah- Sarah Smile. She upgraded my room due to my room was not ready after the check in time. She was also so helpful with telling us where we could walk to for a great meal. We were able to walk to the Casino, Bourbon Street, Canal Street, etc- it is really a great little hotel in a perfect location. Oh yeah, the roof- we thoroughly enjoyed. Nice mingle spot! Good drinks and food! Don't slip- I heard about and purchased thru Hotwire as not known until I paid for it- great choice-but will book direct next time.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",4,Academic Visit to New Orleans at Tulane University,"We had a wonderful trip at New Orleans as we are invited by Tulane University School of Medicine. Me and my spouse were extremely busy with academic commitments. The hotel is very good and near to Tulane School of Medicine. Breakfast is good and service is very high quality. The room is descent, medium size with all the amenities. Bathroom is simply superb. Room service is also praiseworthy. Only draw back is its House Keeping team. One should not keep any valuables or important materials outside as during house keeping things may be missing. One should lock all the valuables in his or her suitcase before leaving the room and kept for house keeping. This issue was serious by nature and we have reported several times on this issue. Otherwise it is a lovely hotel with very friendly front office staffers.Thank you for sharing the details of your stay. We are glad you enjoyed your stay and we appreciate the comments. We do provide a safe in the room for valuabls, in this case I'm aware of the medications that were inadvertently thrown away, I'm glad we were able to retrieve them for you.

While I'm pleased you enjoyed your stay and our door man was helpful, I'm disappointed that any team member came across as rude.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,Honestly great-lacks a pool!,Everything from the property to staff were delightful. This place lacks a pool however. They pride themselves on authenticity. I requested a late check-out and was surprised to have that shut-down immediately. They did however accommodate an early check-in from 4:00 to 1:30ish.
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,awesome stay,"I love this hotel. It was cheaper than the ones - Sheraton and Marriott on Canal - where a conference I was attending was held. The decor is beautiful (Erykah Badu-like art on the wall and retro galore with a bit of artisan flare). My room was at the end of the corner and I didn't hear a thing, a privilege when traveling in a major city. The front desk manager called later to see if I had a good stay. Shout-out to Kavana at the front desk who was kind up my check out and departure as well as the people working in the first floor restaurant. The endive salad and fish was a perfect meal. The roof top bar looked like a lot of fun, but aside from a quick snap shot, I didn't stay as I needed to decompress from my travels. But I shall return. 12-15 minute safe walk to the Quarter. Take Rampart or any parallel street to Canal and head toward river.Thank you for taking the time to review our property and we are delighted to know you had a great stay with us. It sounds like every part of your experience at our hotel was perfect which is music to our ears. We certainly appreciate you staying with us and look forward to having you back as our guest whenever your travels bring you back to Nola.Best regards,"
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,Wonderful Service,"The art deco decor and large floor to ceiling windows created a festive yet zen atmosphere. There was a hiccup upon check-in with the system being down but generally speaking, service was great and staff very friendly. After check-out I realized I was charged for something incorrectly and Chris addressed it immediately and was able to correct it without hesitation. Great location and intimate feel came with friends but will revisit with spouse.Thank you so much for taking the time to review your recent stay with us and we are delighted to know you had a great stay. We appreciate the feedback as it's very important to us and we will be sure to commend Chris for resolving the issue you encountered quickly and efficiently. It was a pleasure to have you as our guest and look forward to having you back for another visit real soon.Best regards,"
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",4,Cute hotel at perfect location!,"My daughter and I have stayed for 5 nights here during our visit to New Orleans. Very cute hotel, modern design, good vibe, friendly staff! We've got a nice corner room at 14th floor, beds were so comfortable and everything is new and clean! Walking distance from French quarter, Bourbon street, Lafayette square, we didn't even use any transportation beside the street car to get to the City Park. Thank you for taking a moment to share your experience. Our guest comments are very important to us, they allow us an opportunity to celebrate our successes while also finding ways we may improve. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit to New Orleans.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager"
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",2,Hot Water and Internet issues,"Not up to HHonors standards. Beautiful property, nice rooms and bath room nice clean carpets and bedding / bed comfort. But, NO HOT WATER for 25 minutes - each morning. Yes, we were told to wait 20+ minutes for the hot water to get up to the room level. And, the internet didn't connect, so we (my traveling partner - in another room) had to use the 'staff' WiFi with their password.Thank you for taking the time to share this feedback and we do apologize for not meeting expectations during your recent stay. I will review all aspects of design and address accordingly to ensure our guests enjoy their time as our guests. The boiler at our hotel did experience a mechanical issue that we addressed as quickly as possible but this did however cause our guests to experience no hot water for a period of time. Please know that this was not due to anything other than bad luck and timing. Our boiler is very new and plenty big enough for our hotel, this was an isolated issue that has been corrected moving forward. We are however happy to hear that you felt safe and secure while staying with us and do hope to have you back as our guests the next time you travel to New Orleans. Sincerely,"
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,Super Stay,"Very pretty hotel. There was Wonderful lady at the check in desk and she handled everything with ease. We had a little bit of an issue but she was so great she didnt make it an issue. The room was spacious and quiet. Everyone and I mean everyone was helpful and friendly. The rooftop bar called The Monkey Board was so terrific. Saturday night was a fun dance party and Sunday afternoon we enjoyed the sun and had some of the most delicious crawfish i have ever had. Thank you so much for this fantastic review of your stay and please know that it has been shared among our team. Chef Dana will be thrilled to know how much you enjoyed his crawfish and its always nice to hear when the team exceeds all expectations of our guests.We appreciate you staying with us and look forward to always being your hotel of choice in New Orleans.Best regards,"
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,Three Days in The Crescent City,"The Troubadour is excellent. Clean, secure and accommodating. All are super friendly and helpful. Quiet, felt safe and the extra was coffee, hot and ready, in the lobby each morning. Centrally located.Thank you for the great review, we look forward to your next visit. Wayne General Manager"
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,Loved everything about this hotel! Especially the staff.,"As a lifetime Diamond member, I have stayed at many Hilton Properties. Several within New Orleans. The decor is contemporary and colorful. Rooms are spacious and well kept. The best part of my stay was the staff. Carl was especially helpful and made our stay easier. i will definitely be back.Thank you for taking the time to write this excellent review and for choosing our hotel as your place to stay during this recent trip to New Orleans. It sounds like our property and service provided exceeded all expectations which is our ultimate goal with all of our guests.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",4,Nice and hip property,"Clean, comfortable bed and modern dcor. A very nice rooftop bar but there are times this place gets too busy for the number of employees, so services gets a 7 (from 1-10) Good value on alcohol.The breakfast service is super good, the have a buffet style and fresh omelette's made to order. Must say this hotel does not really cater to the business traveler, no comfortable desk area in room, no place to make a few copies (i.e. business center) For a vacationer this is super great place, clean, location and good staff.Thank you for taking the time to share this review of your stay and for providing this feedback. Please know that this will be shared among our team leaders as we work to improve in all areas so that all guests have what they need to thoroughly enjoy their stay. It's great to hear how much you enjoyed our breakfast service, location, and most aspects of our property. We appreciate having you as our guest and look forward to having you stay with us again should your travels bring you back to the area.Regards,"
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,Great New Hotel!,"Loved the unique ultra modern design! All the employees we interacted with were very pleasant and accommodating. Looking forward to returning to the property to spend a little more time there to explore the Monkey Board rooftop lounge.Dear 200Williamsf, many thanks for your super nice comments about this new and fun life style hotel in The Big Easy! We can't wait for your return for another Monkey Board rooftop bar and dj music experience. Ron Olstad, General Manager"
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",3,Mixed reviews,"The service was pretty awful. Check in took way too long - only one person at front desk who was extremely slow. Requested cab in AM and staff was unable to secure - got own Uber instead. Arrived back at hotel at 6PM last day of stay and room was being cleaned - unacceptable! We went to the front desk to complain and were offered free drinks at Monkey Board and reassured would be completed soon as well as told that hotel was full - that was why cleaning being done so late - not the customer's issue at all and should not be used as an excuse. Major inconvenience as we had been at French Quarter Fest all day and were planning to rest a little before getting ready for dinner. Also, elevator setup is less than optimal. Big line in lobby to get up to bar interfering with guests trying to get to rooms. Also, didn't seem to be separate service elevator from guest elevator - another dissatisfier. Nice looking hotel - rooms were actually very nice looking/well designed and decent location but really need to get the service kinks out before I would recommend to others and/or return. Lots of other great choices in NOLA....Thank you for your comments Josh, I'm very disappointed to read we didn't exceed your expectations. Your concerns have been shared with my Front Office Manager and Director of Housekeeping so that we can improve. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience and know that we can do much better. We definitely want to earn back your trust and certainly your recommendation. I'll be reaching out to you directly to see how we can do that.Thank youWayneGeneral Manager"
"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",4,Newer hotel offers comfy beds and spacious rooms,"The Troubadour is a couple blocks outside the Quarter which is ideal for driving in and out while there's parades happening. The studio room we had was spacious and comfortable. Nice big shower his and her vanity. Though it had somewhat unsettling, disturbing artwork on the walls. The rooftop bar has a great view of the city but it's sadly not accessible 24/7 but only from 5 pm till last call. They should change that as I'm sure it would be equally enjoyable during the day. The drinks are extremely overpRiced. You're better off bringing your own drinks. I also would've liked to see a pool and whirlpool there but there wasn't. The restaurant had delicious breakfast and pastries and the servers were friendly and accommodating. A couple cons: The carpets in the room looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in awhile and a couple days they didn't stock enough towels or tissue. Also be careful to not leave valuables out, even food. We left some freshly boxed muffins on the desk that we intended to eat later but found they had been taken when we returned to the room hours later. The elevators kept malfunctioning that even the staff found inconvenient. The acting manager, Toriano, the first shift front desk people were extremely friendly, patient, competent and professional and compensated for any mishaps we experienced. They offered us a great deal for Mardi Gras weekend compared to the other hotels in the area. I would definitely recommend this hotel while visiting the city.Thank you for your comments, they are very important to us. They allow us to celebrate our successes, and also look for opportunities to improve. We will certainly share the details with our management team to make sure housekeeping is doing a more thorough job while cleaning the rooms while also taking care with guest items. We apologize you experienced these deficiencies. We thank you for taking the time to share and we are excited to see you again in the future.WayneGeneral Manager"

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",5,Loved it!,"The Troubadour was an awesome hotel for us! I absolutely LOVED the decor. The bed side tables couldnt be beat! The roof top bar was an incredible view and it was even more special because thats where my boyfriend proposed! I couldnt ask for a better view. Its a nice central location and the food market next door was awesome! The only thing I wish was better was the valet service. They werent very timely and one of them gave us serious attitude. Other than that it was incredible and I would 100 go back!! Thank you so much for taking the time to share this lovely review of your stay with us at The Troubadour. It was truly our pleasure to be a part of this special moment and congratulations on your engagement. We appreciate having you stay with us and look forward to having you back as our guest anytime your travels bring you back to New Orleans.Best regards,"
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,4,Had no problem,"I go to Seattle very frequently for business, and this hotel was the 5th that I've stayed in this city. The room was good and clean. Wifi was stable. TV reception was not the best, but wasn't bad eiter.The hotel is right by the lake, so a nice pleasant walk outside. It's also close to a few restaurants and a corner store.Overall, I think it was a good hotel."
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,5,Seasoned Traveler,"Just stayed here for the Who concert and also for the Paul McCartney concert in April 2016. Both at the Key Arena: easy walking distance. Nice thing is that Francisco at the front desk remembered me when I checked in this time! Or better yet, he'd gotten my request for connecting rooms and already blocked them for me! That's pretty good service, I reckon."
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,4,Nice view and location,Proximity to waterfront and downtown Seattle. Room was comfortable and service was good. You can walk to Space needle from this location. Ask for a waterfront facing room. Standard breakfast and internet.
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,1,Vastly overpriced,"I was charged 244 for a one night stay in a very average room, I expected far better for the price sadly this is a similar standard of a holiday inn or days inn who are far cheaper. Staff were friendly enough, reception appeared to be under construction, I shall not be using this Marriott againThank you for your recent comments regarding the hotel. I understand the importance of receiving a value of staying in a downtown hotel, and Im sorry you didnt feel you received that value while staying in the hotel. At this time, the hotel is undergoing a major re-imaging of the lobby space and exterior with additional plans to begin the rooms and fitness area. Once this is completed, I hope you will give us another opportunity so you may see the value of the location and to gain your loyalty. Thank you again for your feedback."
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,5,"Excellent Stay. Great View, Close To Lake Restaurants","I stay at a lot of different Marriott properties and this Courtyard was one of the nicest of the Courtyard brand i've stayed at. It has a big lobby with plenty of seating and a dining area for the Bistro that is very nice. The front desk staff was as usual very friendly and accommodating. They had a room ready for me at 10am when I checked in. Starbucks coffee is served at the Bistro and they have a nice food menu as well. The room was immaculate and the bed was comfortable. Air conditioning was nice and cold. The view of the lake was excellent. I happen to be in Seattle on some beautiful weather days. Clear skies and no humidity. If your doing business downtown and need to see Amazon this hotel is a 6 Uber ride. You could walk to some nice restaurants on the lake or take a short taxi ride for 5. I would suggest Uber from the airport as opposed to a taxi. Uber was a 39 ride and the taxi was a 50 ride.Hi Thomas,Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful experience at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. Much appreciated for the comments on commute fairs and the positive feedback about our hotel and staff. Thank you for staying with us and we hope you see you again on your next visit to Seattle.Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative"
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,5,Excellent location and very good rooms,"I very much enjoyed my stay. The room was excellent and the location perfect for my business trip. It turned out to be very near many tourist attractions as well. I give special kudos to the staff - I left a shirt in the room as I was trying to make a hasty exit to get to a meeting and the staff was wonderful about getting the shirt and shipping it back to me. All in all, a wonderful stay!"
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,5,Ideal location close to downtown,"Lovely place and very friendly staff. Although no shuttle was available from the Amtrak station, they did offer to send a limo driver. He was waiting for us as promised and charged 25, which seemed very reasonable. Hotel was clean. Breakfast was typical for a free hotel breakfast, nothing outstanding, but certainly more than adequate. Walking distance to key downtown sites."

Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,4,Location is Everything,"This hotel is on a well-known avenue and literally across Lake Union. You can see from your hotel room window all of the lake tours available and boats to rent. So many people walking, jogging, and biking around the lake. Make sure you go for a lake view room. Just down the street there are some good places to eat like a BBQ place and Art Mable 21 restaurant. The staff is the best, very helpful and friendly. What I enjoyed the most was their breakfast Acai bowl, so good and an energy boost to start the day right. WiFi is always free and I had no issues.Dear EndyBOSTON,Thank you for sharing your feedback! I am glad to hear that you enjoyed your time at our hotel with the surrounding area being active and upbeat, matching the mood and view of the beautiful Lake Union. The Bistro's Acai Bowls are the best and I'm happy you had a chance to enjoy them at the top of your morning here. We pride ourselves with our staff service and hospitality, so knowing that we were able to take care of our loyal guests, like you, is an absolute delight! Can't wait to have you staying with us again whenever your travels bring you back to Seattle.In hospitality,Alina C."
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,4,"Good Hotel, Great Location","PROS: Amazing views from lake view rooms worth extra 10! Great location close to Space Needle and great restaurants in Lower Queen Anne. We walked to Space Needle and City Center in 15 minutes, it's about 1.1 miles. If you include parking, it is faster to walk. The newly completed MOHI is right across the street, which is well worth the price of admission - we spent half a day there. Great, friendly customer service from front desk staff (Marriott 800-number, not so much.) Now that construction is complete on Mercer access to downtown and the freeway is a piece of cake. Free evening (after 9am-4pm) and weekend parking right across the street (vs 27/night garage parking). CONS: Marriott reservations gave me a hard time trying to get a cheaper rate that came available. Water in room is 3.00. Candy bar in market is 3.50 and they have removed the vending machines. Two cans of beer in market were 14 (the price of 12 a the store). Bistro menu is pretty short. We were not sure if there was any breakfast room service because there was only a dinner menu in our room. Power button on TV remote did not work, but channel changer and volume did.WEIRD: I have never seen a green flushing toilet that used so much water!!! The flushes were torrential. More than my standard toilet at home by double.Thank you so much for taking the time to share your recent experience at our hotel on Trip Advisor! I am happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us, particularly the view from your room! We love the changes that have been taking place in the South Lake Union neighborhood, particularly now that the roadwork is complete. I did want to share that while we do offer room-delivery for dinner, our breakfast is only available in the Bistro. However we are happy to package anything on the menu to-go if needed!We hope you will choose our hotel again next time your travels bring you to Seattle.Sincerely,Rachel PackardFront Office Supervisor"
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,4,Beautiful stay in Seattle,"Stayed in a King room with a pullout sofa for teen daughter. Shower pressure was great and room had a fridge. Had a lovely view of the lake and enjoyed watching the Kenmore float planes take off and land. The staff is excellent at this location. The bartender made some excellent recommendations for dinner. Ask for a coffee cup at the desk as they have complimentary Starbucks in the little market. Prices are expensive for a Courtyard but Seattle is an expensive town.Hello handwesh,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel. I am pleased to hear that you and your daughter had a memorable and positive experience during your stay. Should your travels bring you back to Seattle, we hope to have another opportunity to serve you. Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative"
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,4,Great location and recently updated.,"Great location across the street from lake Union.

Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,2,Not even a complimentary bottle of water for 200/night,"For the rate of 200, it would've at least been nice to get a complimentary bottle of water with the room. There's a hampton inn down the road that is just as 'nice', would rate as average, and provides a breakfast with the rate. I guess if you're getting reimbursed for expenses, then your rating would be higher.I am sorry to hear your stay with us did not quite meet your expectations. However, we do appreciate your feedback and thank you for sharing your experience on Trip Advisor.Sincerely,Rachel PackardFront Office Supervisor"
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,4,Very very good!!!,"The hotel is very nice, even more than I expected! The room is soacious but the queen beds are small! The lobby is very nice and the breakfast at the bistro is delicious! And the snacks in the market are top quality! Service is great!! Had a very pleasant stay here!"
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,5,Brief Comfortable Stay,"My room was in a wonderful spot - near the elevators, near the gym, near the ice machine. The staff was very helpful. They gave very good suggestions about where to go during my short stay. Sorry, did not stay long enough to have anymore experiences. The only thing I can say is that I was very, very comfortable."
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,4,by a lovely lake...,"This is a nice property, just by the lake union. The folks at the front desk were warm, friendly and helpful. I really liked this gentleman who would even strain his neck if there are lots of people at the reception and and peek out to say welcome back! when I return from office! Ha!There are a lots of eateries by the lake, so that's a win too.Some improvement opportunities - this is the only hotel where I found the housekeeping would just keep the bed and bath but wouldn't clear out used glasses, plates, soda cans etc. Those stuff were there on the table even after housekeeping was done.It would be great to have some variety in their room service. Especially if it rains, people opt to stay in have some food and I found the bistro options very limited.Also, the bistro staff were either very nice or made a bad impression - for instance, this one lady with a curly bobbed hair appeared very rude and made me feel like I am serving her when she came to deliver my food and in another instance, this one man appeared oh so friendly, almost too friendly and the moment I signed the receipt he was looking for the tip amount - making the whole thing feel like a forced show to get tip rather than genuine hospitality.But yea, the property is great and everything is at walkable or short driving distance. Overall 4 star experience."
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,5,Stellar service experience.,"I'm so impressed. I got in late last night, and needed a cab early in the morning, and needed on time. The person I spoke with at the desk confirmed they'd have it there when needed (and I'm sure she meant to, she was very helpful). Well, staff changed overnight and the message didn't get passed on, and even if it had, apparently they're not supposed to do that, I should have called in the morning. When the car wasn't there, I was frustrated. The person I spoke with was very apologetic and tried to help, but when I realized what happened I just immediately booked an uber, and left very disappointed. Things like this are mistakes, no hotel (or person for that matter) is above an occasional mistake, but how it's handled makes all the difference. Tonight I got a personal email from their operations manager apologizing again, which was totally unexpected, and very appreciated. As if that wasn't enough, he also credited me a bunch of Marriott Rewards points in an effort to go the extra mile. Wow. I was amazed! I've had bigger things than this happen, and have just been told basically tough luck. They didn't have to do anything and they did. You could see a small hotel really caring about my experience, but generally I wouldn't expect it from a large chain (or the LARGEST in the world for that matter). My trust is higher now than it was before I checked in. Thank you. Definitely Redeemed. Other than that, normal courtyard, great."
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,4,Great Family Stay Before A Cruise,"No surprises here, a great stay at this Courtyard! We were in town for 2 days prior to boarding our cruise and we loved our stay. For two adults, a child and a senior everyone was happy. The room was clean and nice size. The view of Lake Union from our room was beautiful and the location was great! Gym, great for the stay!Food in the restaurant, served its purpose and great to be on site!Service, fantasic!Very Happy with this stay!Thank you so much for your wonderful review! We are so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay with us before your cruise and hope to see you next time your travels bring you to Seattle!Sincerely,Rachel Packard"
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,4,Great Staff!,"My 18 year old nephew and I recently spent 3 nights at Courtyard-Lake Union. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff was especially helpful and friendly. They accommodated a connecting room request (even with a late arrival), helped schedule a whale watching tour and overall very friendly. The rooms were very nice, clean, and well maintained. The surrounding area has a lot of construction currently but other than that the location is great. It is within walking distance of the Space Needle. I would definitely choose this hotel again."
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,4,Great location and good service,"We stayed here for 9 days for vacation purposes, so we experienced pretty much everything this hotel has to offer.It's location is great. It is right in front of Lake Union. Ask for a room looking towards the lake (floors 5 or higher): you will be rewarded with beautiful sunrises and sunsets. You will also see people kayaking and swimming. And Kenmore Air departs for its water seeing tours from there, so you can see plane lift ups and water landings: cool!As though that was not enough, you are 1 mile away from Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuli Gardens, etc).We had a car, so it was nice to find plenty of parking, even for SUVs. Unfortunately you will be charges 27/day.Rooms are very comfortable. The staff (all of it: reception, restaurant, housekeeping) makes a point of acknowledging customers in one way or another every time they see you. And Whenever you request something they deliver it rather quickly, regardless of the hour. The hotel has a swimming pool and a hot tub. Small both of them, but good enough.The restaurant is open for breakfast and dinner only. No complaints on the service: very good. Breakfast offerings are fine: from healthy choices (oatmeal, yogurt with granola, fruits, etc) to more elaborate ones. Variety is limited but decent and it is all prepared rather fast. Dinner options were not attractive to us. We found them a bit over priced for the quality and quantity. However, the hotel has a small market where you can find a few things to eat, assuming you do not want to go out for dinner.A few blocks away from the hotel there is a Starbucks and a McCormick Schmick's restaurant, both of them with waterfront viewing. And about 5 blocks away there is a Bartell drugs where you can find medicines, regular snacks and a few more sophisticated options (salads, Gouda cheese, prosciutto and good crackers, etc).All in all: great place to stay. I highly recommend it."
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,5,Favorite Marriott in Seattle,"This is my favorite Marriott property in Seattle. The location is hard to beat and the water views are worth the great sunsets and I love watching the seaplanes come and go. Many great food choices are in this area, with even more coming to Lake Union. Nice remodeled lobby and breakfast area. Staff is always super friendly and you have to love the extra points game they offer at check in. I'll be back soon!Hello TruckeeTroutTraveler,We greatly appreciate you taking the time to share your wonderful feedback about your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. I am glad that we provided you with a positive and memorable experience and exceptional service. Hope to see you soon!Dan PhamGuest Service Representative"
Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union,4,Nice Property but Expensive,"Stayed at the Courtyard Lake Union for one night on business and I usually dread staying at Courtyards but was pleasantly surprised how well appointed this property was. I believe it has been significantly renovated and they've done a great job!The location is excellent with a lovely view of the lake and walking distance to many restaurants, bars and sights. It takes about 20 minutes to walk to the space needle and about 60 minutes to Pike's Place.However, I've only given this hotel a 4 rating as 430 for one night is crazy for this level of accommodation.Hello kmalho,Thank you for taking your time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union hotel. Our hotel did go through quite a few renovations and I am pleased to hear that you liked it. We hope to have another opportunity serve you whenever your travels bring you back to Seattle.Sincerely,Dan PhamGuest Service Representative"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Hyatt House is pet friendly,"We always use Hyatt for all inclusive vacations but this time traveling through the US we decided to try Hyatt House. We were traveling with our 2 dogs - we were a little taken back by the non-refundable pet fee of 75 for nights 1-7, we were only staying one night and thought this was a little steep. However, after checking in and seeing the cleanliness of our room, being a pet friendly room you expect to find at least one sign another dog had been there - Nope! Immaculate! Great cleaning staff! This location is very convenient and we will stay here again. The hot breakfast was delicious. The staff very accommodating. Nice place all the way around. 5 stars!"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,2,Great location lousy service,The hotel is new and the rooms are very nice BUTthe waiting time for the elevator in the morning can be up to 20 minthe Que for breakfast is so long and you cant even get a seatno poolrooftop is closed in winterthe free shuttle bus... you need to wait from 30-45 min for 5 min drive and 15 min walkhouse keeping do very little - room was not cleaned as expected when you call the reception it takes 5-10 min to be answered
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Leisure trip,"Wonderful stay! The hotel was amazing. Modern, superb location, clean and wasn't expecting a full kitchen. The staff was wonderful!! Especially Brennan!! Very helpful! Breakfast buffet is top notch! Create your own omelet!"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,3,"It All Depends on the Size of the Room, Day and Time of Arrival","I recently spent two nights at the Hyatt House on Fifth Avenue in Seattle. Great Location - but I felt the Hyatt House was a bit disappointing. It began with the check-in early Sunday evening. Two Hyatt Housers were on the desk - but only one working intake. I waited about 5 minutes to be checked in. Next was the size of the room - extremely small even for the room type. Next was the food service in the bar - absolutely the worst burnt cheeseburger I have had in quite a while accompanied by 16 broken potato chip pieces and a cupcake which was advertised to be scrumptiously fancy (it was not - it was plain awful and dry). Next was the shower - no water pressure (and this is a relatively new hotel). One of the better highlights was breakfast, while selection was limited - the food was good.Hyatt Houses are usually outstanding - evidently I caught the Seattle Hyatt House on Fifth Avenue during a underperforming period.ZAismy2ndHome,Feedback from our guests is very important to us and we appreciate the detailed concerns. We strive to exceed all of our guests expectations and know we still have some work to do. Please let us know if there is anything we further assist with - we look forward to another opportunity to serve you in the future.Sarah Junge"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Close to many attractions,"We chose this accommodation due to its proximity to several sites. Museum of modern art is 1 minute walk, Space needle 1 minute walk and the monorail is a 1 minute walk.There is also a collection of restaurants and shops an easy 2 minute walk from the HotelWe checked in late, about midnight with friendly and efficient staff.The room has a queen bed with separate kitchen, bathroom and lounge room and is very comfortable.The Hotel has free tea and coffee in the foyer and a happy hour between 4.00pm and 7.00pm every night with US3.00 pints.Breakfast is sufficient with both hot and cold selections buffet style.The free shuttle to a radius of a kilometre was enough to get to Pikes market which was good. When you are ready to return just call and they will collect you from one of the designated pickup pointsI would return to this Hotel if ever back in Seattle"

We know you have a lot of choices when staying in Seattle and are thankful you choose us and would highly recommend us.Thank you and I hope the rest of your trip in America went just a great! Sincerely,Jonathan"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Hidden (In Plain Sight) Gem,"My family and I were surprised at just how good this place is. Given its location right in the heart of Seattle Center and its affordability, we thought for sure something was amiss. Parking in the area is expensive, here it is 25/day with full in/out privileges in a protected garage. The rooms are spacious, with a kitchen (microwave, stove, full fridge/freezer, sink, etc.) with an elevated dining table. Add the spacious bedroom, bathroom, and sitting area and you have a comfortable place for four to stay. The full breakfast is above average but the real hidden gem is the H Bar. We ate here a couple of times and the food is outstanding. The happy hour features a good selection of 3 local tap beers and the place is never really crowded. I'm not sure the tourists know they can come in otherwise I could imagine thirsty and hungry tourists at Seattle Center walking the minute or two to here, having a beer and a bite, and easily going right back to the Space Needle. I searched for the H Bar on Trip Advisor, but it's not there. NOTE TO HYATT HOUSE: You might consider getting the H Bar added as a restaurant if you want to increase your business.Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be. I greatly appreciate your kind words and they will be celebrated with the entire team. If I can be of any assistance to you, please contact me directly. We look forward to being of service to you in the near future. Best regards, Jonathan"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Location is everything,"It is right under space needle. You can even see Space Needle from the window. After the tour of space needle, kids actually had a nap in the hotel as it is only a few steps away. It is a new Hyatt property with free breakfast."
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,New Years in Seattle,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Our hotel was steps away from many city attractions and restaurants. Hotel was clean, staff friendly, and room had a view. They served omelets at breakfast and the burgers in the bar/lounge were better than any on the street and available late at night!"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,4,Good space for rate,"A standard not fancy hotel that provides a little privacy and extra space at a good rate if you want an affordable suite. Decent pretty big breakfast buffet (could someone figure out that 15 of us don't digest dairy and really like having something like soy or almond milk). little pool only good for kids. Nice big lobby and lounge areas.Jesse L,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,3,Convenient but not worth the cost,"This hotel is fine. The room was nice and the lobby clean. The buffet was good. My problem is you pay a premium for this hotel due to the location and it really isnt' worth the money., in my opinion. Stay at a hotel farther out and take the public transport system. Our one night stay for a basic room with a king bed was 345. Also, they give you ear plugs on your nightstand. Not a good sign. Bring a noise maker to drown out the noise.Dear TinasB3116Mo,Thank you very much for taking the time to review our hotel and share your stay with us. I very much appreciate the feedback and sorry to hear that you felt the cost did not match the experience of being at the heart of Seattle across the street from Space Needle. Our prices do very through out the year and often are much lower. Also if you are a World of Hyatt member and book directly with Hyatt.com you can save an additional 10 off.I hope you do keep us in mind the next time you are in the Seattle area. We would love to host you again! Most Sincerely,Jonathan"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,"Excellent Stay, tremendous location","Located right across the street from the Space Needle. The complementary breakfast buffet was excellent and much better than the Residence Inn hotels. There are several restaurants within walking distance for dinner. For the more economical meals, there is also a McDonalds across the street from the hotel. The Duck Boat tours also start from next to McDonalds.The rooms are of decent size and comfortable. They also have a complementary shuttle to the Pier 66 from where NCL ship departed. Will highly recommend it to people and will be my personal choice of stay in Seattle in future as well. The front desk staff is exceptionally polite and helpful (particularly Nate), and so are the shuttle bus drivers. Prices for the hotel are on the high end side, but so are most of the Seattle downtown hotels.ChandraHSGBI,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of our 24 hour shuttle and the complimentary breakfast spread in the morning. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Fantastic hotel!,"Starting with the location - excellent. Perfect to explore the downtown area on foot, many attractions within walking distance or the free shuttle will take you.The room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. We loved having a small kitchen, we loved everything about the room.We were helped by Behder at the front desk who answered all out questions and made us feel very welcome.Any time we return to Seattle, there will be no other option for us than the Hyatt House."
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,"Fun trip, great place!","This hotel is perfect for going to do all the fun things in Seattle at Seattle Center. You can walk to everything and there are many restaurants in the immediate area.Love everything about the hotel great service took care of all of our needs, the only thing that I would ask is that if they do have room to grant your request for late out. They have a policy absolutely no late checkouts which is OK. Not a dealbreaker.Debbie F,It was a pleasure to have you as our guest recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and it is exciting to hear that you found the staff to be helpful and inviting. I will share your feedback with all of the team who has been consistently recognized as exceeding customer service standards. We appreciate the positive comments and will look forward to your future visits to Seattle.Sarah Junge"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,4,"Roomy rooms, great amenities","This is a long-term stay hotel, so our room came with a kitchenette and small living room with a sofa and coffee table. We only stayed there for three nights, so didn't make use of the extra space, but it was nice to have room to move around. The reception desk was helpful and friendly. Breakfast was great, but skip the omelet bar. The line was too long, and it took forever. There were plenty of other options available (cereal, fruit, pastries, potatoes, eggs, oatmeal...). The complimentary shuttle was great for sightseeing. We took it to Pike Place and downtown saved on taxis and uber. Housekeeping could be more attentive, but since our stay was brief and we're not slobs, it was fine. Can't beat the location - literally across the street from the Space Needle and Chihuly.mistybunny,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,4,Seattle,"Room ok ( we had queen suite) bathroom very small. Restaurant poor. Staff friendly and tried to please.Hitel well suited for my needs as near the conference centre. Hotel shuttle bus fabulous ,drives 1 mile radius around the hotel, so very convenient and easy to get to shops and restaurants.Dear EvelynK,Thank you for taking time out of your to complete a TripAdvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

We appreciate your business! Sincerely,Jonathan"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,2,"Expectations set high, but no delivery","The location of this place is prime. The hotel condition, on average is nice. I found my room fantastic, with a kitchenette and living room. The elevators were old and confusing (only one went to the garage, but you could not call just that one and there were no stairs).Breakfast was average-- the scrambled eggs were really dry and so were the waffles/french toast.Some of the staff were kind and helpful, but many didn't seem to care and others seemed new. Maybe this location had a high influx of new front desk members at the time of my stay. There are two kiosks at the front desk, and a phone between. While I was checking in, the other kiosk was also occupied by a staff member assisting a customer, and another staff member was using the phone between to talk loudly to a service member about a customer who had not had their room cleaned in three days. This was concerning, distracting, and off-putting. This also distracted the lady helping me check in from doing her job.One night, we were awoken by a very loud banging noise coming from the room next to us close to midnight. The banging, accompanied by yelling, continued for several minutes. Worried and scared, I called the front desk, but the person who answered didn't seem to care about the situation and at first didn't offer a solution until I asked if there was nothing they could do, and they said they would send somebody up there again. The front desk staff member said the lady had been locked out by her partner who had deadbolted the door. By this point, the lady had been standing outside her room yelling and banging on the door for half an hour (by her account-- overheard when she yelled at her partner when he finally opened the door). I'm worried that the staff allowed this to continue for so long. What if the partner had been suffering a medical emergency, or had never opened the door Nobody followed up with us regarding this issue, which was disappointing. Had someone touched base in the morning and apologized for the inconvenience, I likely wouldn't be writing this review.Upon checkout, the front desk staff threw away a handwritten not eaddressed to me as a guest of the company whose conference I was attending because my partner was performing the checkout. Overall, I was really let down by my stay here. The rooms are so nice and the location is great. I thought the Hyatt brand could be trusted with providing a great, seamless customer experience, but it didn't seem like they cared.Hello and thank you for taking the time to share your experiences at our hotel with us. First, I offer my sincere apologies for the poor care shown to you by my team. We are in the process of training several new additions to our staff but this does not excuse the lack of professionalism and lack of interest in resolving your concerns promptly and with care. Please know that I have addressed your concerns with my team so that we can continue to improve our quality of care. If I can be of any additional assistance, please contact me directly."
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,4,Perfect Seattle Location,"The hotel is located across the street from the Space Needle. Its also within walking distance to Pike Place Market and other places along the wharf. The hotel is quiet. I never heard another person while in the room and virtually no street noise. Rooms are stylish and the beds are very comfortable. It has a mini kitchenette so if you there for a period of time it would be great. My only complaint is that the clocks in the room were still on Pacific Standard Time, not Daylight Savings. I did not notice this until the morning and was late for an appointment. I tried to change the clock but was not clear on the clock how to change the time. When I checked out I notified the desk that they should check the clocks in the rooms.David B,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown. I have shared your feedback with the team as we pride ourselves on the things we do right and how we can continually improve. Thank you for the feedback regarding the clock in your suite. Please know this is extremely important to us and we have our maintenance addressing this concern as we speak. I deeply apologize for the inconvenience this caused. Safe travels we hope to see you again while visiting the area!Sarah Junge"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,wonderful new hotel,"Even though I'm a local I stayed here with a group before a cruise. Right across from the space needle and they offer a shuttle for the downtown area. Because its across from the Monorail station it makes getting downtown super easy. New rooms with electric shades, refrigerators and microwaves. While rooms are slightly smaller the furnishings are top notch. The breakfast buffet is great with an omelette bar and lots of fresh fruits. Lobby bar and restaraunt is very reasonable and good. I'd be happy to recommend this hotel to friends and travelers as its super nice.davidgmg,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your staycation here in Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We are thrilled to hear that you created wonderful memories and utilized the amenities within our beautiful new hotel. We are always trying to leave our guests with lasting memorable experiences.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,BEST location in downtown Seattle,"The absolute BEST location for a downtown Seattle hotel just steps from the Space Needle, EMP Museum, Pacific Science Centre, etc.. Fully equipped kitchen in the suite and LOTS of space -- larger than most one-bedroom apartments! Excellent buffet breakfast setup with top-notch food quality and very comfortable seating with views of the Space Needle, etc. The rooftop deck has lots of comfortable seating and fire pits etc,, so a wonderful place to wind down and end your day. Too bad the parking stalls are extremely tight limited however, it's to be expected for such a prime downtown location. We will be back for sure!877tiffanyl,We are thrilled to hear the Hyatt House met your needs and appreciate the positive feedback. Im glad you were able to take advantage of the kitchen facilities in the room, complimentary breakfast spread in the morning and rooftop terrace. Its wonderful to know when guests have a comfortable stay as we are grateful of the comments. We look forward to your next visit in Seattle!Sarah Junge"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Felt better than Home !!!,"I have to first say, I have been staying in just about every Hyatt in the U.S. But the staff at the Hyatt house is hands down the Best !!! I came in for business training. And on the 2nd day my car broke down, after the stress with AAA. Mind you, the hotel staff picked me up, even gave me a ride to pick up my car!! Look I have seen far and beyond going out of the way...but they gave me a peace of mind. And even took the price off the parking!! I mean they didn't have to, it was not their problem. But took the time to help a guest out... On top of that, you can't beat a better view to sleep with than a view of the space needle. Just want to say this is a great place a home from home why I keep coming back !!! Great job gals/guys and thank you! Dear KaylaNGerardW,Thank you for completing a TripAdvisor review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. Please know that your feedback is extremely valuable to us and we will utilize your response to make every guest experience the best it can be.

We very much appreciate your business and hope to see you again hopefully soon! Sincerely,Jonathan"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Place to be,"This hotel is the place to be to experience downtown Seattle. The Monorail, Seattle Center, are across the street and the waterfront is walkable or by shuttle. The Light Rail from Westlake Center can take you right out to Sea-Tac. We'll be back!!!Sarah P,Thank you for staying with us next to the Space Needle! We love our incredible location and are ecstatic that you felt the same way. As one of the newest members to the Hyatt family, we are more than appreciative of your feedback and am glad to see you enjoyed your stay. We pride ourselves on our guest satisfaction and hope to see you again soon in the near future.Sarah Junge"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,2,Family Time in Seattle,"We were in town to visit with our daughter and also see my brother. We stayed at the Hyatt House. The staff was friendly but not very empowered. Their directions on the ways you have to use the room key in the elevator and room were not very clear. We heard that over and over again as we went up and down the elevator with other visitors. The room had strange windows that looked out to the hotel interior. We missed having a window to do a quick weather check. The bathroom was spacious but had the most non-ergonomic faucet. Turning it on meant bumping your hand on the lighted mirror above the sink and that was unpleasant. All the elevators stopped working at one point and the staff only offered a free bottle of water despite the significant challenge for the hotel visitors. I observed a person in a wheel chair as one example. No help was offered for getting yourself or luggage to and from the lobby (besides a free bottle of water from the lobby shop). Although sometimes things happen, it is how the staff responds and this was a major disappointment. The free shuttle will take you up to 1 mile away if it is available or you can wait. The breakfast buffet was good, but they did not always restock items (including coffee lids) in a timely fashion. I don't recommend this hotel."
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,4,Probably the best location to visit the main sights,"We chose this hotel because of the location and we weren't disappointed. Right opposite the music museum, science museum and space needle. Happy Hour at the bar offered a good selection of local beers and wines. The rooms weren't huge but comfortable and clean. The breakfast was buffet style and a little bit busy with everybody having to convene in a small corridor area where the buffet is served but lots to choose from. Omelettes can be made to order. Convenient to walk the short mile to Pike Place and also to savour many of the great restaurants in the neighbourhood. One negative comment is that there are only 2 elevators for the entire hotel, so you could be waiting quite a while for the elevator to come to your floor if it was first thing in the morning and everybody was heading to breakfast. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to guests.Thanks so much for taking the time to leave this review! We are so pleased to hear that you got to experience the neighborhood attractions. We are totally biased, but we think it's pretty great as well! We feel privileged to have had you as our guest - we hope it won't be the last time. Safe travels to you wherever you go - thanks again!"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,1,"Overprized, overvalued","Good location, nice room, but that's it. No atmosphere, impersonal, not really interested front desk, chaotic and hilarious, above all poor and hardly any choice breakfast, a room with a view of an office building at 20 meter distance (privacy), room cleaned at 17.00 after our request, not a real clean room, found even 2 cockroaches on our bed when we went to sleep, no safe in the room. Just some of our disappointments. Relationship price quality, there is none with usd 689 2 nights! There are no doubt better options in Seattle skipp this one."
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,A fabulous place to stay near the Space Needle,"My plans to use my 2 free hyatt nights in Mexico fell through but time was running out so even though I thought I was going to be wasting them by staying at Hyatt House in Seattle, I didn't have a choice. As it turns out, I made an excellent choice. Though not a luxury hotel in Mexico, our visit to Hyatt House was wonderful! Check in was straightforward and easy (with the best service ever, but more on that later). Once we were moved (by request) out of the strange angled corner room with a view that looked out on another room, we were absolutely delighted with our stay!! The room was surprisingly quiet despite being next to the street and near the Seattle Center Activities. We loved the location, literally across the street from the Space Needle! The view of the Space Needle outside our window was romantic and the rooftop terrace provide an unparalleled 360 degree view of the city. The room layout was really cool and the decor is very modern (like a boutique hotel). The bed was very comfortable (firm but not hard). A (very) minor complaint is the textured fabric of the bedspread, which was a bit rough to the touch, but the sheets were crisp and smooth. Another minor detail was that I missed having a tub for soaking, but the rain shower turned out to be fine (lots of space in shower, could use a seat or shelf for sitting) Lots of storage space (as well as hangers) if you are staying a few days and want to unpack. The kitchen was fully stocked including dish soap, which seems unusual in hotels these days for some reason I don't understand. The free hotel shuttle was a great value and breakfast was decent- a pretty good selection though crowded on Sunday morning. he only thing that wasn't perfect about our stay was the fact that housekeeping never came the second day. We put the sign on the door and saw the housekeeper next door as we were leaving, but for some reason our room was skipped. It's always nice to come home to a freshened-up room and a made bed. We had enough towels to get us through, so it was fine, especially given that everything else was so good. Saving the best part for last, let me say that more than anything I have described, what we liked most by far, about our stay at Hyatt House, was the absolutely amazing service provided by Eden at the front desk! Everyone at the front desk was truly great, but she was a shining star! I'm not sure I've ever experienced a more genuine welcome or felt as appreciated as a customer as she made my husband and I feel. Thanks to her, this was a perfect weekend getaway!"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,1st trip to Seattle,"This was my fist trip to Seattle, and this hotel was in a great location. Pikes Market is about 1.5 miles away. Everything is in walking distance, or there is a shuttle that will take you up to a mile out. It was a great experience.Dear AlexanderpX371AN, Thank you for completing a Tripadvisor Review regarding your recent stay at our hotel. I am glad that the location was a great for you!

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Great Break,"I recently stayed at the Hyatt House Hotel in Seattle, it was a great place to stay. Our room was very nice and clean, the staff were helpful and friendly, and our view out of the window was of the space needle. The hotel is in a great location with a 2 minute ride on the monorail into Seattle town. Plenty of restaurants and coffee shops and Pike Place Market to wander around."
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Just about perfect.,"Great location: we wanted to find a hotel that was centrally located enough to not need a car, and the Hyatt House fit the bill. We flew into SeaTac Airport, took the light rail to downtown (Westlake stop) and took the Monorail to Seattle Center (Space Needle, EMP Museum, Chihuly, Key Arena) which is right next the the Hyatt House. Great accommodations: the hotel seems brand new, extremely clean and modern, very spacious. Great staff: everyone was very nice and informative. We got to town about three hours before check-in and they let us check-in early. Great free breakfast: in addition to many choices, there is also a made-to-order omelet bar. Jay cheerfully made the omelets every day and they were excellent. And he would remember my name each day which is pretty amazing:) Other: they have a free shuttle which will take you where you want to go within a certain distance. The gym is not bad, although it is on street level with big windows, so you kinda feel like you are working out in a fish bowl. Great restaurants, coffee shops shopping within walking distance. About the only thing I didn't like was the parking - 25/day (we rented a car a couple days to visit the mountains) but there are cheaper parking lots within a block so it wasn't that big a deal. Check all the travel sites to compare prices - I found one that had the same room for 20 less a night than the rest. Overall the Hyatt House was an excellent choice for our Seattle vacation!Cushionhead,It was a pleasure accommodating you recently at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown and we sincerely appreciate the glowing review! I have shared your feedback with the team regarding your experience and will strive to make sure we are exceeding all of our guests expectations.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Beautiful hotel right next to Space Needle/Seattle Center,"This is an awesome hotel! The staff was very nice and extremely helpful. The hotel is modern and beautiful. The location is excellent, right across the street from the Space Needle. The roof top terrace is lovely day or night with an amazing view of the Space Needle. Easy to get to downtown via a 2.25 trip (each way) on the Monorail to Westlake Center. From Westlake Center, it's just a 10 minute walk to Pike Place. The hotel also provides shuttle service within a mile.Cheryl H,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,4,St Patrick Day Dash Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel for the St Patrick's Day Dash in Seattle due to its location. It is a nice hotel, right across the Space Needle. We stayed in a suite... it actually had a full kitchen! Including dishwasher, microwave, garbage disposal, etc... Perfect for a family staying for a few days. Our room was facing other rooms, so when you open your blinds, you will see all the other rooms... kinda creppy, so beware and request a room facing out to the street.The hotel server a hot breakfast and it was actually pretty good. Supervised me how good it was, I even went back for seconds. Hotel has parking... but spaces are very limited and very small.... so leave the Ford350 at home.All in all... excellent hotel and an excellent location.FMH60878,Thank you for taking the time to submit such pleasant comments about us at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Best place for what I need,"I always try to stay at the Hyatt House whenever I'm in Seattle for business. The rooms are studio apartments and extremely well kept and clean. The staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The bar / kitchen is open late and the breakfast is pretty good for a free meal. This is not the place for people looking for a luxury experience with a ton of amenities. It's centrally located to Seattle landmarks and if you're lucky you get a view of the Space Needle.Dear JenK Wow! Your header says it all. I am so happy to hear this and that you felt the Hyatt house was exactly what you need. Thank you also for being a repeat guest. Any time we get a 5 star review we celebrate it as a team.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,3,Just Right across the Space Needle,"Very convenient location to Downtown Seattle. Its located right across the Space Needle. We only stayed here for 1 night. They have very good and delicious breakfast! Omelette was a hit! Front Desk and Dining room staffs were very Friendly. We arrived on time to check in so that we have more time to see Seattle. But, our room was not ready. We waited for couple of hours in the lobby before it became available. What Not very impressive!Then the whole night our wifi wasnt working. They said they will reset the router as soon the Technician arrives but it was already too late. We had to check out early for our City Tour and our cruise Housekeeping I think they have to pay more attention in terms of their room services. Towels and toiletries supplies were not enough to accommodate 5 people. We had to request some more supplies. After a couple of hours we waited for the availability of our room We expected way better!"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,4,Beautiful location,"This hotel gave us a perfect location for our short trip to Seattle. Located directly next to the Space Needle, Chihuly Gardens, the Monorail and Seattle Center was beyond our expectations!! They offered a shuttle to all locations within a mile and we used this many times. Clean and courteous shuttle drivers as well!"
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Spacious apartment style rooms,"Very impressed with this hotel. Great location opposite the Space Needle - and the monorail ran past our windows - no noise at all!So convenient for getting quickly into the centre for all your sight seeing. Rooms are comfortable and clean, with little kitchenette facilities. Breakfast buffet was good, and there are ready meals and snacks to purchase from the front desk area if you arrive late and want to rustle up a quick bite in your room.Ideal for families travelling to Seattle this was a comfortable and well equipped base.Recommend and would return."
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,4,Nice hotel right next to Space Needle!!,"Hotel is situated right next to space needle (major attraction in Seattle downtown). Across the street there is the space needle, the Chihuly gardens, the EMP, and the Seattle center, a lovely park with an amazing playground. Breakfast in hotel was complimentary and was good considering a budget hotel (3 star). The courteous and always willing to serve staff and Chef played a big role. Free 24 hr shuttle within a mile of hotel but sometime wait time is high if you are in downtown markets.Well worth it in Seattle!Devendra G,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,4,Trusted Standard,"We stayed at Hyatt House Seattle Downtown for two nights. It is a convenient hotel with studio style rooms. It is well located right in front of the famous Space Needle. You have to walk about 15 minutes to Pike Place and the Centre but that is still very convenient. Breakfast was included, but we did not make use of it. They do have a small bar and Happy Hour in the lobby (we did not make use of that either but saw the sign). Staff is very friendly and helpful. It is one of those places where you get exactly what you paid for and know what to expect. Good space, comfy bed, big shower and anything you need to have a comfy stay. Only thing: the elevators are ridiculously slow we stood down waiting for one car to arrive what felt like ages. And we are happy to spend our last night there as well on our way back home."
Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,2,"Door Left Unlocked, Wrong Credit Card Charged","Housekeeping left my door unlocked, and at the end of my stay the staff charged the wrong credit card. The people were pleasant, but if I had a choice between brusque staff who did their jobs properly and pleasant people who did not, I'd take brusque.Paul M,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,4,Great hotel for families,"Nice hotel for families. We booked a 1 bedroom suite with 2 queen beds room. Lots of space and very clean. However, these rooms unfortunately do not have a very good view - they look into other rooms and courtyard. I think the studios have good views of the Space Needle. The breakfast buffet is great. Location is great - right across from Space Needle. We walked to Pike Place Market - a long but very doable walk.SFCALUSA,We are sincerely appreciative of your complimentary remarks on your experience at the Hyatt House Seattle Downtown.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Just Right...,"I really enjoyed staying at the Hyatt House, the room was comfortable, the shower was great.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Great stay,"We stayed here wilt our grandson and his Dalmatian dog and we had a terrific stay! Julia was joking with our grandson about how big the dog was and he thought that was great, everyday when we got back to the hotel he was looking for her to talk to about what he and the dog did, and by the end of our stay he was hugging her goodbye. Housekeeping was also terrific, never ran out of anything. Keep up the good worklwill789,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,"Great Location, Great Value","We stayed 4 nights and had a corner room. Its across the street from City Center and the Space Needle. Hop on the Monorail and you are downtown, a short walk to Pikes Place Market. Its hard to find nice rooms in Seattle for under 200 a night, which is what we paid, including taxes and parking. Oh, and did I say breakfast was included.Dear Gary S,Thank you for completing our Guest Survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

Hyatt House Seattle/Downtown,5,Excellent hotel for Seattle tourists,"If you're not a Seattle veteran, you need to know that there are 3 main downtown neighborhoods. The old city by Pioneer Square in the south, the heart of downtown near the Pike Place market, and the northern neighborhood near the Seattle Center (Space Needle). While the heart of downtown has traditionally been the best neighborhood for tourists to stay in, the ongoing revitalization of the Seattle Center area has somewhat shifted this equation. Personally, for tourist purposes, I like the Seattle Center neighborhood just as much -- primarily because it's a little less corporate, a little more casual, and has ready access to many of the best museums (like the EMP across the street from the Hyatt). It's also only a 20 minute walk to the Pike Place market from the Hyatt House, and they offer a complimentary shuttle service, too.In this context, the Hyatt House is a grear place to stay if you're OK with the Seattle Center location. The hotel is new, and has a nice modern vibe. Since it's an extended stay brand, rooms at the Hyatt House are large. For this particular location, they also made them stylish. As a Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum member, my family was upgraded to an extremely comfortable one-bedroom suite facing the Space Needle. Breakfast is well above average for a free hotel breakfast, My only complaint was that the omelette maker was completely overwhelmed, and it could take more than a half hour to get an omelette (the buffet food had no delays). It's a nice touch to offer omelettes, but it doesn't work unless they can be made efficiently.The shuttle bus can also be a bit of a mixed blessing. In rush hour traffic, the service can be quite slow. I'd recommend walking to downtown during peak periods.Dave'sreviews,Thank you for choosing to stay at Hyatt House during your recent trip to Seattle and for taking the time to share your experience on TripAdvisor. We value the feedback from our guests and are always striving to improve our guests stay. Please let us know when you return as wed love to welcome you back as our guest.Sarah Junge"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Staff went above and beyond!,"What a killer hotel! I got in really early and there was no room available when I arrived, but the front desk took quick care in making sure I had somewhere to change and get ready for work in time! Such great service! Rooms were very clean and well maintained with great views of the city! I will be back, thanks!Hi Michael, Thanks for the great review!! Glad we were able to help get you to work on time. Your coming back is what matters most to us!See you then!Evan"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Recommended,"Comfortable, quiet, friendly staff. The lobby is amazing and a great place to meet for drinks. The room I had was small, but functional. Elevators were always available.Overall, this is a nice gem in downtown Philadelphia close to City Hall and restaurants. I highly recommend it.Todd,Being a part of the opening team, I have said from day one, even during construction, that our lobby would be the most beautiful and exciting in the city. It is always great to hear that our guests such as yourself feel the same! Our team is always working hard to ensure that you have a quiet and relaxing stay, and I am glad that you felt we were successful in that attempt. I hope we see you again soon!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Should really be a 4*,"This hotel was recently opened 7 months ago and used to be a bank. The room was clean, spotless and very comfortable. I was traveling in business and it was smack bang in the middle of centre city with easy access to everything. There was a TV in the room with loads of channels to keep you occupied. The shower and toilet were very clean. The only thing I'd say is for the shampoo and shower gel provided to be fragranced..that's just my preference.The staff were get polite esp Walter and Troy..thanks boys for making my stay welcoming..it was great to chat with you guys and sorry I didn't get to say goodbye properly. I can't comment on breakfast or food as I didn't have this and I don't drink so cannot comment on the bar.Lastly the vibe was really nice and Noamaan, Now that's a headline! We are shooting for 7 stars but there are rules about what defines star or diamond level. Those ratings are related to amenities instead of service. That's why we love TripAdvisor! It provides real stories about real experiences in hotels. Thanks for sharing yours. We appreciate the 5 star review. I will share the shout outs with Walter and Troy, though I suspect they're watching too...Hope to have you back soon!"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Wedding Room Block,"Our guests had a fabulous weekend. Rooms were beautiful. Staff were amazing and so accommodating. Comfortable lobby with pool table and games was a great meeting space. We had a light breakfast for our guests the morning after the wedding in the lobby and it worked out great. Would highly recommend Aloft Downtown as the hotel for your wedding guests!Hi Jeanne, Thanks for the FIVE BUBBLES!! It was a thrill to serve the entire wedding party. It was the first time we used W XYZ for a wedding brunch and we're delighted you enjoyed the space. Sorry about the rain, it would have been really cool for your family and friends to enjoy the Backyard. Hope the bride and groom enjoy the honeymoon! We'd love to have all of you back for the anniversaries! Evan"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Great hotel and location,"The Aloft hotel is in an excellent location, it is right next to city hall and the market and walking distance to so many other shops and restaurants. The hotel itself is extremely clean as was the hotel room. The room was on the smaller side, but if you're like me and my husband, you're not there to spend all your time in the room. It was plenty of space for the two of us. The bar downstairs is nice, we each enjoyed a cocktail there one of the nights. The only negative I would say is the expensive valet parking, however we went one block north on broad st and found parking for 15 dollars a day. Overall a great stay and highly recommended. Lindsay,Thank you for your kind words! We truly are fortunate to be in the heart of so many great things that Philadelphia offers. I am so glad to see that you enjoyed your stay so much, and that you were able to relax not only in your room, but at WXYZ Bar as well. I look forward to welcoming you back the next time you visit our fine city!Best,Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Nice hotel,Great stay at this hotel. The staff are wonderful! The hotel is very close to City Hall and Reading Terminal. Great outdoor patio and fun lobby. The rooms are nice and bed comfortable. Hallways are a little narrow but is an older renovated building. Definitely would stay here again.
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Great stay for a quick business trip!,"We stayed at the Aloft for a business trip. It was super convenient having this hotel right next door to convention center! Staff nice, rooms clean, beds were comfy and spacious, great bar and outdoor space to relax! Ill stay here again if I have to come back for work. Train station a little over two miles away. I submitted a survey the first night there asking for an orange pen (they have the best) and the next day before lunch there was a bag hanging on my door with four pens in it. Talk about paying attention to detail. What a great customer experience. Hi Sarah, FIVE BUBBLES!!! We love it, thank you!! Glad you got some time to chill in our Backyard, it's the perfect place to hang after a day of work. If the 4 pens run out, you know where to get more :) Come back just for fun, we are not only about serving you for work. Perhaps you can PEN a best seller...Happy Summer, Evan"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Very comfortable and quiet,"Very good situation in the center of Philadelphia, the beds are perfects. Our only night here was just great, the night are completly dark, which is important for us, and very quiet. John was very helpfull. Thank youCD, We appreciate the great review! Glad you got to take advantage of the blackout shades and quiet space for a restful night sleep. Hope to have you back for more than one night! Evan"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Best Staff Ever,"We needed a room for one day after surgery and having to return to the hospital the next day so Aloft was closest! To our pleasant surprise the staff was above and beyond accommodating from Tevin in Valet department to Misia and Tatyanna front desk! Thank you so much! Linda, Hopefully the surgery was as successful as the as your visit to our hotel. We do have the BEST STAFF and are grateful for their efforts. Tatyanna, Misha and Tevin will be cheered and celebrated for your shout out. Thank you for recognizing their efforts. Heal fast, then come back and have some fun!Evan"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Great stay at Aloft Philly Downtown,"When we arrived, our 2-queen room had not been prepared. The staff gave us 2 1-king rooms for the first night, then moved us to a 2-queen room for the second night. They were very helpful in scheduling our move and handling our bags. Well done!Hi 429,Thanks for the FIVE BUBBLES!!!! Sorry we didn't have the two bed room available upon your arrival, that sometimes happens in our biz. Glad we were able to overcome and create a great experience for you. Hope to get back soon, there's still plenty of summer left to play! Evan"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Nice Spot In the Heart of Philly,"The staff and hotel were very nice. The rooms were modern and obviously recently redone (at least our 13th floor room was.) The building itself is old, but it looks good inside. The lobby and bar are clean and modern. There is a pool table and lots of games to entertain kids and the young at heart in the lobby area.Downtown Philly is heavily populated with the homeless. The Methodist Church across Arch St from the Aloft Downtown seems like a focal point for them. Several times I was approached for a handout, but never felt like my wife, son and I were in any danger. I wouldn't necessarily recommend walking alone after dark in the area, but it is a bustling area during the day. We walked back as a group to the hotel from City Hall subway station after a Phillies game (maybe 11:30pm) and it was fine.It is very easy to get to a bus or subway train in a 5-10 minute walk. The views of City Hall are stunning and Love Park, the Reading Terminal Market, even Independence Hall and the Museum of Art are all walkable. The Convention Center is right next to the Aloft, so it would be a good place to stay if you were attending a conference there.There were always Uber and Lyft drivers a minute or 2 away when we needed to get anywhere. There are also cabs and the hotel offers Valet parking for 50 or so a night. There are also several parking ramps and some street parking in the area as well.There is a McDonalds across the street, but no restaurant in the building. There is a small store for food and drinks inside the lobby and a 7-11 convenience store a block away down the street on Broad St. Otherwise, I didn't find a ton of food options immediately around the hotel, but there are a lot of options a couple blocks away.It is certainly not cheap, but I liked the hotel and I would stay there again the next time I go back to Philadelphia.Hi JW, Thank you for the FIVE BUBBLE review! We get excited when our guests connect with our hotel and city as you did. Your last line I would stay there again is what we all work hard to accomplish. We also appreciate your taking the time to provide other travelers your experience outside the hotel. Our pride extends beyond our hotel and into our community. It's great that you're sharing personal and authentic stories, thank you for that. I hope all your travels bring you much joy!Evan"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Phily Stay,"Awesome hotel in an awesome location in an awesome city. The staff went above and beyond. The style of the hotel was great. We had an awesome view of city hall. Perfect central location to do anything in Phily.Perryjo9,Thank you so much! Awesome is certainly the word I would also choose to describe our team, they are the best in the city, and we are truly fortunate to have them all. I am so glad to hear that you enjoyed yourself so much, and I hope that we have the chance to see you again soon!Andrew DrydenAssistant General Manager"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,More than expected!,"It was my first time staying with aloft but now it has become my top choices. The location was great and accessible to trolleys and within walking distance to many spots. The room was well decorated with many chargers. Front desk was really helpful and friendly. The only problem is the terrible sound insulation that I could hear my next door clearly. Many leisures in hotel but I was too busy to explore. Definitely coming back for my next stay in Philly.Hi Jane, We are thrilled you're coming back to Philly and of course our hotel!!! The FIVE BUBBLE review is much appreciated!!! Everyone needs to stay powered up. Thanks for noticing how we placed USB ports all over the hotel!! Bedside in two locations, on the desk, under the W XYZ Bar and throughout the lobby areas. We want to be sure your connected and in touch!Can't wait to have you back! Thank you for your business!Evan"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Our New Favorite Hotel In Phili,"Everything was great, staff is wonderful, Misha at front desk was so helpful! So glad I picked this hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday. Loved our room-was a corner room with 2 queens, very comfortable. Favorite part was the lobby, just a great place to hang out, nice bar, fun games, music at night, really cool area. We will be back!Mich, MISHA is amazing! We are glad you chose our hotel for the B-Day celebration and that we took good care of you. Of course you don't have to wait for his birthday to come back, we can help write a new Rx if needed: Phillies, Bell, Parkway, Casino, Shopping, Kimmel Center, Concerts, Theater, just to name a few :) See you soon! Evan (Misha's biggest fan)"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Location is perfect,"My other half and I always enjoy Aloft hotels wherever we go for the modern decor, pet friendliness, and good value. Downtown Philadelphia is no exception. The location is absolutely perfect. You walk right outside and are staring at City Hall on Broad Street. If it wasnt so stinking cold it would have been an ideal location for walkability. Rooms were as expected for Aloft, and value was great as usual. We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return when it isnt so cold outside. Hi Micah, 5 STARS! Wow, thank you! Glad you enjoyed our hotel and of course the perfect location. The weather gods were a little off in their timing for your visit. We are looking at record highs this week, want to come back We've got some space available!Looking forward to your enjoying our backyard on the next visit. Sending warm thoughts...Evan"
Aloft Philadelphia Downtown,5,Cooler than custard!! I love it!,"What a cool hotel!

Thanks for staying here and hope to have you back soon! Evan"
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",5,Best Boutique Hotel in Key West!,"The Saint Hotel in Key West is by far the very best boutique hotel on the island. The staff is beyond amazing - gracious and accommodating in every manner. Thank you for making every day a great day!The hotel and grounds are spotless, the pool area is an amazing place to totally unwind and relax. The music is perfect, and the sounds of the waterfall really set you up for a great day in the sun of Key West!My room was beautifully appointed with marble floors, modern furnishings, and a large marble bath. House keeping and turn down service was exceptional as well.I would compare The Saint to a 1,000 a night boutique hotel in South Beach - the vibe is cool, and you will not find it anywhere else in Key West!After staying here for a week, I HIGHLY recommend The Saint and can tell you this is the ONLY hotel in Key West that I will be staying at in the future - it can't be beat!Thank you for choosing The Saint Hotel and for the amazing review. Being a new hotel we depend on our reviews and we appreciate the wonderful words. We'll see you next time you're in Key West."
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",4,would return,"great location right off of duval street. our room however was extremely small, smaller than a cruise ship, but very nice all the same. staff was friendly, breakfast was enough to get you going. pool area was beautiful. the only problem we had was that our room keys did not work properly. got one of them fixed which was good because after 11:00 at night no one is at the front desk to let you in lobby or hotel, a key is needed so double check you keys to outside entrances. would definitely return.As you found out, there is not a lot of space in Key West and yes some of the rooms are cozy. We appreciate the review and look forward to your return."
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",5,We Play Naughty and Sleep Saintly alright!!,Great place to hang and rest after doing the Key West thing. The staff was very attentive and courteous. The decor is gorgeous! Attention to detail from the lobby to the room's bathroom. The pool area is an oasis to cool your body and enhance your soul. We plan to make this our place to stay whenever we're in Key West and can't wait to check out the one in New Orleans.

"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",4,"Location, location, location!","The Saint is about as well located as any place in key west. There are 2 (hidden) side entrances/exits as well as the main one on Eaton street. if you use a gps, DO NOT enter the Duval street address -- you will end up going in circles.Main entrance is up a few steps. you can park in front for 15 minutes, and if you have luggage, go inside and ask for help.room 113 is on the main floor, and mostly dark since the shutters need to be kept shut during the daytime (there is a busy walkway right outside and anyone can see in -- for same reason, it can be a bit noisy at times)the entire property is funky, in a playful way. photos on this site will show you why.staff is friendly and anxious to please. any major problems should go to the general manager, abraham, who is eager to make the hotel as good as possible.oh, the location. no car is needed. you are 5 minute walk to truman white house, 10 minutes or less to mallory park/sunset pier. also greene street is the same area and has a lively night life as well as key lime pie stores every few steps.hemingway house is towards the other end of Duval street, but can be reached in less than 20 minutes if you don't stop at all the stores and eateries along this main street. go another 10 minutes or less, and you will be at the end of Duval, and reach the southernmost point in the continental u.s. -- where the famous buoy sits. you may need to wait on line a few minutes to take a photo at that spot. also, a great cafe right on the beach there. finally, for dinner, you can almost throw a dart and find a terrific place within walking distance of the saint. have fun!Dear ischloss,We greatly appreciate that you took the time to write such a thorough review about your recent stay at The Saint Hotel Key West. We hope that when your travels bring you back to Key West, you will once again choose The Saint and give us another to earn that 5-star rating!Cheers!"

"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",5,Happy Hour and more,Paul the other bartenders are always so attentive. I enjoy going in and relaxing. I tell everyone I know to stop in and see how nice the Saint is. The food is good and the drink menu is fun... I tell all my friends to stop in 417 to 714 happy hour.It's a great happy hour to try all that we have to offer in food and drinks. Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we look forward to seeing you soon!
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",4,Pool was the best part,"Clean, nice staff and wonderful pool. Great location, but because of that it's pretty noisy. The decor was not my fave, but that's not a big deal. There were little things off like no mini fridge or fan in the bathroom.Thank you for your feedback. We are always looking for ways to improve our property."
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",3,Quaint boutique hotel slap bang downtown,"Side door onto Duval St. Perfect location. Rooms may be smaller than anticipated for US guests but standard for Europe. Poolside is great, excellent bar. Didn't eat so cannot comment on food. One big let down was housekeeping. Very poor for this level of property. GM knows who I am and they had plenty opportunity to fix it, but never came back. Overall still pleased. But fix room cleanliness and you then merit Marriott Autograph Collection...Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you ended up enjoying your stay but would have loved for you to have a perfect stay. We are taking action to prevent the issues you experienced from occurring again.

"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",5,A Must See Hotel....an Attraction,"What an experience....... Old on the outside.....New modern on the inside. Our room was Small but when in the keys you don't spend a lot of time in the room. First class service. Valet Parking which you need if u stay downtown. There is a 30 fee for parking but it's worth it. The reception room is very unique and the bar is beautiful. It does have a pool and gardens are beautiful. It's close to Malery park to watch sunsets and is by all the restaurants and bars.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We always appreciate feedback whether it is good or bad and we are ecstatic that you had a great stay with us. Please come back and see us again, we would be delighted to have you!"
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",4,Ultra Modern,"Hotel was a fantastic location. The room was unique and we'll maintained. Enjoyed the blue light located throughout the property. Bed was conformable, however small. Good and happy vibe. 1 opportunity I would make for improvement is the timeliness for valet. Car retrival took well over 30 mintutes. I noticed their bell staff was not around and the lobby hardly have anyone in it. When you are paying 30+ for valet it should be rocket speed. Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed your time here and we hope you will come back and see us again. Parking and valet services can take some time because our parking lot is located six blocks off-site. We are happy that even though you experienced issues with this you still enjoyed your stay."
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",5,Best Location in Key West,"This was the second time I had stayed in this hotel. The first time I stayed it was still under the Southern Cross Hotel management group. I chose this hotel the first time due to its location, but after staying noticed it could have used some updating however the location made up for that. Well now that The Saint has rebranded this hotel it is truly the best value in Key West with top notch amenities along with the awesome location.On this trip we stayed with family and friends and this hotel meet our needs perfectly. I do think this hotel is also great for a more romantic getaway. It definitely has that modern romantic feel, but also suit family's as well. Very well done.The staff is among the nicest we have encountered in Key West and they really go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay. We will definitely be staying here in the future and I highly recommend you give this hotel a shot on your next trip to Key West. You won't be disappointed.Thank you for letting us know how much you enjoyed your recent stay at The Saint Hotel! We appreciate your positive comments on our staff and hotel atmosphere. We are so glad that you found it conveniently located to everything! We hope you will come visit us again. Thank you again for your review."

We are extremely thankful for your recommendations and your excellent praise of the property. We hope we have the opportunity to accommodate you on your next trip to Key West."
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",5,Awesome place,The Wait staff in Bar not so good and not friendly. The rest of was stay was very good. Clean rooms great location for the Duval Crawl. I will be back next time I'm in the area. Being I am a fan of Key west I wanted to try something differentThank you for your feedback and I will share this with the Food Beverage manager so that this is a single occurance. We hope to have another chance to serve you on your next trip to Key West!
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",4,Cool Vibe Central Location,"If you are looking for a hotel with a cool Miami-style vibe in a central location, this might be the place for you. The hotel is located right on the main drag (Duval street) so it's close to restaurants, drugstores, bars, etc. You can walk to everything from the hotel. The downside to the location is that it is close to Duval. We were in a room that was close enough to Duval that you could hear partying way into the night. After having difficulty sleeping the first night (noise until about 3 am) we asked to moved the next morning, the person at the front desk entertained the idea but was not able to come through. An apology or at least some empathy would have been nice (for example, Oh, I'm sorry the noise kept you up). That was not the case. The response was, At least you're not in rooms xxx and xxx because those are right on Duval. Not what I expected from a place like this and also because we are platinum members of the hotel chain. The pool area is small but lovely with its zen motif and trees in the background. The rooms were also pretty hip and the toiletries very nice. The hotel staff was fine...cordial..but not friendly or terribly accommodating. The free breakfast perk for platinum members was a parfait (fine but not up to par with other hotels in the brand). I might have taken the points and paid for the breakfast instead. At the least they should give you a credit to apply to something else. The bikes on the property were GREAT! We also enjoyed outstanding drinks at the stylish hotel bar. Overall, we had an enjoyable stay and would probably choose the hotel again the next time we are in the keys. Thank you for taking the time to write a detailed review of your stay with us. We are glad to hear that you enjoyed your stay aside from some of the issues that you mentioned. We are disappointed to hear about some of the issues you had and we will be sure to address them. We do hope you will return and allow us the opportunity to provide you with a perfect stay."
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",5,Heavenly Stay,"We stayed for New Years Eve 2016. From the minute we walked in the door we were treated like preferred guests. Abraham and Maria made us feel right at home. They were even kind enough to keep the bar open so we could enjoy a drink after a long day of travel. Paul, Lane, Justin and Jess were all fantastic behind the bar. The Shipwreck was out of this world and Paul should be nominated for Sainthood for the way he makes this drink. Overall, we had a fabulous stay. The pool was warm and with some adjusting of chairs we were able to catch some sunshine. The hotel location was absolutely ideal. We walked everywhere and there were wonderful places to eat and drink all around us. This is the place to stay in Key West! Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are so happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us and that you were able to indulge in one of our delicious drinks. We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to each staff member you mentioned. Please come back and see us!"
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",5,Respite in the Heart of the Action,"A hip vibe and soothing lounge music greet you at this fairly new, white-clad, 36-room property located steps from Duval Street, the main drag in Key West. Staff seem a bit over-taxed at times but they bend over backward to assist with everything from meals, room service, taxis, and logistics. Service was excellent, starting with the smiling assistance of bellman Gustavo, who is helpful, not to mention easy on the eyes. Rooms are simply decorated in a modern white motif with blue accents. Blue lighting predominates on the exterior, too. Many of the rooms open with balconies and patios to a lap-style pool crowned by a waterfall and Buddha at one end. Careful - they do have some rooms accurately billed as petite that would be cramped for a couple. My Superior King was spacious enough and comfortable, and was part of the new remodel/construction. You may want to request a newer room. The location cannot be beat. It sits in a relatively quiet block of the otherwise clamorous Duval Street. Through a side gate you step right onto Duval. Go left and hit all the iconic bars from Hemingway days. Go right and there are more of the same, including all of the gay bars and clubs that are only 4 to 6 blocks away. I walked to the marina for several excursions, to the southernmost point and south beaches. The hotel has bikes available at no charge. I only needed a taxi to get to the airport and far-off marinas for some of my excursions. Overall, this property served me well. Its common spaces are chic and modern, the rooms are comfortable, and the people working there make things as easy as possible.Thank you so much for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your stay with us. We are thrilled to hear that you enjoyed your time and the amenities of our property! We will be sure to pass along all of your kind words to our employees so that they know their hard work is appreciated. Please, come back and see us!"
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",5,Amazing hotel experience in a prime location,"The Saint Hotel is a top notch hotel located only half a block from the action of Duval St. From the check-in experience, to the amazing upgraded room overlooking the beautiful infinite pool and the convenience of the prime location in Key West this place was awesome. Upon check-in I was helped to my room by the amazingly helpful and friendly staff and I was directed to some places I should check out for the nightlife all within walking distance. The next 2 days, I started my mornings with the complimentary continental breakfast followed by exploring the island of Key West on 1 of the complimentary hotel bikes. I was able to end my afternoons with some relaxation in the amazing pool area. The entire staff was extremely helpful and professional throughout my stay. It was great to see the manager Abraham was very active with the everyday workings of the hotel staff and guests to ensure everyone has a great, unforgettable experience at the Saint. I would without a doubt stay at The Saint on my next trip to Key West!!Miss Elissa, Very Nice, you told me you were going to write a review, but I didn't expect all this, your writing has definitely spread smiles throughout the employees. Thank You, the whole staff thanks you. We are delighted you chose The Saint Hotel during your stay in Key West, you were a fun guest, easy to talk to and a delightful ray of sunshine around the property. Should your future travels bring you back to Key West, we hope The Saint Hotel will be your preference out of the many hotels to choose. Once again Thank You for the wonderful review."
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",4,Smallest room I've ever had,"First off I'll start with The Saint is an unique boutique hotel that sits on Eaton Street with access to Duval Street. We had booked what they call the petite double I believe and they aren't wrong. My husband paced it out and we figured it was approx 150 square feet. That being said it did have everything you needed and was tastefully done, but you'd never want to stay in it more then a night or two. They had a lovely balcony over looking Duval Street that sadly for us was 1 room away from ours and on NY's Eve they had their party on it . I wish I would have known this in advance as laying in bed after midnight it felt and sounded as if I was still in the middle of the dance floor. That aside I suppose I should have expected that being NY's but I've never been in a hotel especially a Marriott where the party was more important to the guest comfort. They have a lovely bar in the lobby away from the guest rooms which would have been a better and less noisy option for the quests who weren't attending their NYs party. All and all I'd say there are plenty of other choices to stay at in Key West at comparable costs (this wasn't cheap at 448.00 per night for 2 for the smallest room) that would cater more to the comfort of their guests then the 50 dollars a person they made at the NY's party.I apologize for the noise on New Year's Eve. Key West is a hot spot for the holiday and our hotel is known for the balcony countdown party overlooking Duval Street. The rates are comparable to other hotels for that night yet may have not been quieter on this busy day on the island. We hope you will give us another visit on a non-holiday and reserve one of our larger Superior King rooms that will be more comfortable for you. Happy New Year to you and your family."
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",5,A quirky unusual place to stay,"My husband made these reservations and I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews. I was a bit more nervous when I saw their lobby which is far from the usual Marriott lobbies. However, our room was spotlessly clean, overlooked the lovely pool area and was quite nice. It was smaller perhaps but not nearly as small as I expected from some reviews and not small enough to be an issue. The staff was very accommodating and interesting. The location is centrally located and convenient. This is not a cookie cutter hotel. There is absolutely nothing cookie cutter about it. If you're looking for something unusual, this is it. Thank you for your kind review and for you loyalty to Marriott.We do appreciate the fact that you gave us the opportunity to surprise you in a positive manner. And we are delighted to hear that we have been able to meet and go beyond your expectations.As a boutique hotel from the Autograph Collection of Marriott, we are proud to differentiate ourselves by our unique concept and design.We hope to have the pleasure to welcome you again in the future."
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",5,What a gem!!!,"This property was delightful in every way -- the perfect place to celebrate my birthday! The decor was unique and our rooms were very comfortable, functional and stylish,. The pool view afforded us a surprisingly quiet stay, particularly given the proximity to Duval Street. Paul and Tripp at the bar were both amazing, each in his own way. They are artists behind the bar, brewing (literally sometimes) concoctions that are different from anything I've ever tasted, but each was really special. And what can I say about Andrew in the kitchen He cooked our tuna and snapper catch in 3 courses, and they were nothing short of magnificent. Again, like nothing I've ever had before. I LOVE this place, and will undoubtedly be back again, hopefully before too long!Thank you so much for your review, we are so delighted your birthday was a success. It tickles me to hear all the great evaluations you have for our staff. I must mention Andrew has this unequivocal desire to please, he lives to see peoples expressions after their first bite. Its good to know we've made a new friend, hope to see you again soon."
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",1,Bad mistake,"What a bad mistake choosing this hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member, I thought that I could expect a certain minimum standard in service and accommodation. Man, was I wrong! Although I booked the least expensive room type, I expected a room upgrade, if available. The Marriott website showed a number of upgraded room types available, but the hotel refused to upgrade. I have never seen this before. The manager lied to me, saying there were no other rooms available, and had no explanation when I pointed to the front desk clerk, who confirmed what the Marriott website said about other rooms available. The room I was provided was the smallest room I have ever experienced...my home closet is larger! Worse yet, the room did not feel clean. The bathroom floor was unacceptable. Thankfully, I was able to check out the next day and find a much better hotel at about a third less. In sum, ridiculously small, unclean room with horrible management.Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback regarding your recent stay with us. We are disappointed to hear that you had a less than perfect experience. We will pass along this review to each department to ensure that problems like yours do not occur again. Cheers!"
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",4,Wonderful location!,"I great place to stay just off Duval street. The registration staff was VERRY helpful with great suggestions. A very eclectic small hotel. A small bar area was very comfortable. Others have commented on the great bartender...that was not our experience. He seemed to be completely focused on his Brit and Aussie patrons to the exclusion of the rest of us. I would return here for the accommodations and pool area Thank your for sharing your feedback regarding your stay with us.Glad that you enjoyed our location and our facilities.However, we are sincerely sorry to hear that you had a less-than-perfect experience at our bar. And I am 100 sure that if you give them a second chance, our staff will know how to make it right to you. Our bar is one of our major asset within our establishment. Their attention to details and their natural sympathy made them become a reference in the island.We hope he will have the chance to fully meet your expectations during your next venue at the Saint."
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",4,Great place to stay!,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Saint Hotel in Key West recently. The room was beautiful, the staff very friendly and helpful. We loved the balcony overlooking the pool. We really think there should be a mirror in the room so that two people can get ready at the same time, rather than having to wait for the bathroom steam to clear before the other person can get ready to go out. We did have to ask for towels and toilet tissue the second day, but the staff were quick to bring them to us. We also received extra hangers when we asked for them definitely needed more hangers! We thought the location was perfect, and the bikes were a treat also. We did lose WiFi, Tv, and music due to some sort of work going on in the street. It all came back on after a while. We enjoyed our stay at the Saint and would definitely stay there again! Jim Lois HoganMr. Mrs. Hogan, thank you so much for taking time our and reviewing our property. We greatly appreciate all the kind words about the hotels rooms, location and staff. I think its a wonderful idea about having a second mirror in the rooms we will definitely take it into advisement because it would enhance the experiment. Should you travel to Key West in the near future we hope you will consider The Saint Hotel Key West as your next residence. Thank You once again"
"The Saint Hotel Key West, Autograph Collection",5,Wonderful stay...,"We were in Key West September 18th thru September 22nd. We were supposed to meet another couple but unfortunately they couldn't make it because Anne- Marie broke her ankle shortly before the trip. So, we got to the Saint Hotel that Sunday after being dropped off by a taxi that we took from the airport. I would have never believed that something so beautiful would be behind the front doors that we entered. Once inside,the place was magnificent! The room, the pool, the bar/restaurant area were all so nice! I would be remiss if I did not mention how friendly and personable the staff was, particularly Gustavo Lobo and Maria. Gustavo was so helpful and friendly. He was so pleasant to be around. He went out of his way to help us, especially when we were at the pool. And Maria, she was so personable and a pleasure to talk to. Both were outstanding people! Wish we could have stayed longer! We mistakenly left a bag of gifts at the hotel when we had already left for home and after calling the hotel to see if we had left it there, it was sent back to our home within five days! Great place, both hotel and island!!!!!!!!!Thank your for this amazing review.Please be sure that I will share this comment with Gustavo Maria. They make us proud everyday by providing a genuinely caring service to our guests.In addition, we are flatted that you truly appreciate the unique decor and saintly vibe of our establishment. And it is true that the Saint is full of surprises and mystery...On the other hand, I am sorry to hear that your trip with us was too short, but note that we will always be pleased to have you here in Key West."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,"Pleasant stay, but could use a facelift","We recently stayed at the Suncoast Hotel for a wedding we attended. This hotel was chosen by the couple, so we weren't sure what to expect. The staff was pleasant enough. Upon entering, we immediately noticed how strongly it smelled of smoke (much stronger than any other casino we've ever been in). Our room was spacious enough and clean, though dated somewhat in appearance. The toilet in our bathroom leaked a bit and the brass towel racks were all scratched up as well. The wallpaper was peeling off in a spot or two. Our toiletries were not replenished at all during our stay, but we didn't bother to call about it. The price of course is ridiculously low. My husband and I aren't big gamblers, so thought we would enjoy some time by the pool. We were surprised at how small the pool was and that there were no poolside servers. It is more like any backyard pool rather than a pool for a large casino. There is a TGI Fridays near the pool, which we were able to get drinks from and ate at a couple of times. The food and service there was very good. There is a bar by the pool, but it wasn't open at all during our 4 day stay. This property is a good 30 minute ride from the strip, which is about a 50 cab ride one way! For us personally, we would much prefer to stay closer in as we like to site see and visit different restaurants. The pool is also a large deciding factor for us as well."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,Just OK,"I have stayed here a few times and most recently this week. Their deluxe rooms are sub par, the ones with the golf view are somewhat better and worth the money. The Mediterranean two bedroom suite is a great value and the Presidential was a swing and a miss for us. All of the rooms are spacious, but the bedding in the deluxe rooms was uncomfortable. We never stayed in the one bedroom suite, but Med suite is very large with ample common space and generous sized bedrooms. The bathrooms are green granite which gives a nice feel to the room. We most recently stayed in a Presidential suite (one of four in the hotel) room 960. We were booked in the Med. suite, but decided to accept the up-sell upgrade and pay the extra 124 per night to check it out. While it is about 1,000 sq ft larger than the Med. the huge common area was wasted on the two of us. The two bedrooms were a bit larger with the king master offering a beautiful panoramic view of the golf course from the bathroom. The rest of the room has sweeping views of the mountains, once you get past the immediate view of the top of the parking garage. The master shower has a shower panel that looks to offer a variety of body jets with a shower head. The thing was awful with the only two options being the waterfall and shower head or just the waterfall. The first night the water barely got hot enough to take a shower. I reported the problems and they fixed the water temp but not the panel. The water in LV is very hard and this panel also had the classic green deposits that come from the water. You would think they could afford some CLR to clean the unitWhile I am on the soapbox, I must comment about their toiletries. The shower/bath soap was a tiny little white bar in a cheap cardboard box. The shampoo and conditioner were equally cheap, but the kicker was the hand/face soap. It was a little round disc in a plastic package. When I opened it to use it, I thought it was a recycled soap piece! It had no lather and was just crap. If anyone from the property reads this, you really need to re-think these products as they scream CHEAP. The rest of the facility is a midstream casino/resort experience. Granted, you are not on the Strip, but there are nicer neighborhood properties in the area. The newly added The Game sports bar and Subway are decent. The Deli. offers a great value for your money albeit with a limited menu. There is also a movie theater and a variety of other restaurants that we didn't try. The pool appears to be small for the property, so investigate it further if you plan to spend much of your stay at it. The staff are all very friendly and there is ample and easy parking. Overall, not a bad place, but just OK.Thank you for posting your comments on your recent stay. I have sent your comments to our Facilities and Housekeeping teams to address. I hope the next time you stay you will take the time to enjoy all the amenities our property has to offer. Have a nice day."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,2,Doesn't look like Vegas.,"We decided to stay a few extra days in Vegas and found a good offer at the Suncoast, plus we wanted to spend our mornings hiking in Red Rock. The positives: economical, close to Red Rock, large pool, lots of parking, large rooms, nice staff. Negatives: old, the carpets are shaggy like the atmosfere in general. In the end we wound up just sleeping and spending the afternoons on the Strip, which takes 30 minutes by car.Thank you for your review. Sounds like you enjoyed most of your stay, and you will be pleased we are going through a full scale remodel of our hotel rooms. I think you will be pleased with our new rooms, and we look forward to your future stay. Have a nice day."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Best Place Ever,"Stayed here from October 12-18th. Excellent location, away from the hustle and bustle of the strip traffic. Great eating places around, shopping for ones who like to shop. One the greatest bingo halls ever. I came her in April and won 46,080.00 playing bingo, came back this time and my husband won 1430.00 playing bingo and then won another 500.00 when they called his name on a raffle drawing.Rooms are to die for, absolutely beautiful, had a wonderful view of the city, mountains and golf course. Next door also in two other casinos to enjoy, and 5minutes away is the beautiful Red Rock Casino.The slots are also nice to play, did not win a lot, but stayed alive and did not lose my shirt.Will definitely be coming back to stay."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Great place- nice people!,"During our recent stay in Las Vegas, NV we stayed at the Suncoast Resort and Casino. The room was very large with a great view of the golf course (had to pay extra for the view!). The maid was very nice and friendly. We ate at three of the restaurants that are onsite. Good food and a very fair price. There is a movie theater onsite. We went to a movie and was surprised at the size and comfort! Nice! The resort is close to the red rocks. To top off our trip, one of us won a royal flush. Loved our visit-great room, comfortable bed, nice view, quiet, and very welcoming."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Our team strives to provide service that makes every guest feel at home,"I got a 'thank you for staying with us' email with the above words in it. On my last trip I had just left the Suncoast and was talking to a slot attendent at the Mirage who also likes the Suncoast. He asked why I liked it so much and I said I did not know - now I know - I feel so comfortable here. I stay at the Suncoast for 2-3days every 2months as part of a longer10-11 day holiday. It is not the Strip but it is still a nice casino - a locals casino with bowling, a cinema and bingo hall. But it also has a conference centre / banuet hall. You do not look out over the Strip but you can look out over a golf course and their nice pool area. When I stay on the Strip I actually ask for a Mountain View room - rather than a view of McDonalds and Walgreens! Even though I am a semi regular I am treated as a local. If I room charge I do not need to show ID - that's OK - we know you. The Cocktail waitresses even remember what I like to drink. They like my English accent! I had changed the dates of mt stay and the receptionist spotted that my dining credit had not been carried over so she corrected that. They now have sofas for the rest of your party can rest while you sign-in. The area is smoke-free - for those not used to casinos but I still say I do not recognise the casino as being smokey. I like the buffet for breakfast (8.50 inc tax) but then Du-Pars for Dinner where I can sit and have the food brought to me. The wine is 5 a glass 4-7pm - a nice end to the day. I'm interested in trying PengZu. The menu is on the Suncoast website and has some interesting dishes that attract this 61yo white guy. For burgers etc they have The Game sportsbar or the bowling alley snack bar - I have enjoyed both. Some days I do not feel hungary but I am tired so I get a Subway and a bottle of wine from the Gift shop (Glen Ellen Cabenet 4) and retire to my room. There is a refrigerator in the room. Du-Pars do the room service but the menu was missing from my room the last two trips. At some hotels that would be an issue but not at the Suncoast. My next trip will be in May with a suite at NYNY, a room at the Suncoast and a suite at the Mirage. I have asked for a Tuscany suite on eStandby. If I do not get it I will be happy with my 550sqft Suncoast room with floor to ceiling windows. I can get a bus from outside NYNY (or the airport) to the Suncoast for 2 - the Westcliffe Express (WAX). The bus can take me back to the Strip and somedays it has taken me to Downtown to visit the Suncoast's sister properties.Awesome! We love to see five-star experiences. We are glad our mission is fulfill through you experience with us! Thank you for visiting us! See you again, next time!"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,1,Nice Casino/Terrible Management,"A nice clean casino with affordable restaurants. However, the service you get from the hosts and managers are nothing short of Unacceaptable. Being one of the newest casino in Summerlin area does not give management the right to have a chip on their shoulder. Unlike other casinos who treat their guest as if they would want to be treated, the Suncoast management don't care if one has a pulse as long as one bring in revenue to their casinos.Their compensation for players is Zero. You can be sitting there for 5 hours and end up with a 10 buffet voucher, which they will write it off on their expenses. I stop an executive host to ask a question about the table action and he purposely ignored me and walked away. I have been to this casino in the past and swear to my family and friends that I will never make the drive and step in this casino AGAIN. Suncoast management should understand that they are not the only casino in Vegas and they are not close to being the best. I would rate them bottom of the barrell.Suncoast management: Go back to the basics and treat customers well and they will come back for more action."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,Suncoast Hotel mixed review,The Suncoast Hotel itself was nice. The room we had was a standard king room and very spacious and clean. The bed and pillows were rather industrial (hard). The fitness room was well-maintained and the hotel overall pleasing. The casino was well-ventilated and equipped with all the standard gaming.The breakfast buffet was a bargain for we mature folks. The evening buffet was mediocre at best.The desk was verrrry slow in checking in.The biggest disadvantage of the Suncoast is its location out away from the Strip and downtown. It is isolated in a more residential part of northwest Las Vegas. They do try to compensate by making a free shuttle available which ran on time and took guests to the airport or to the Strip.
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,coffee shop food sucks/ buffet service bad,"lady manager so rough/flirty...tall n sloppy . talks like a man .. didn't care about the problem... as far as the rooms concern n , restroom they'll all clean. tight machine... most of the time lost all my money. lean my lesson wont want to even try again.Thank you for your feedback regarding the coffee shop, service at the buffet, our staff, and more. We must apologize that your experience with us was unsatisfactory this is not in line with our usual high service standards. Your comments have been forward to our Food and Beverage departments. In the future, we encourage you to bring this to our attention immediately so we can rectify the situation promptly. Again, thank you for your review and we look forward to your future stay."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,Las Vegas - Way out West!,"Booked for a convention over a Friday thru Saturday recently, It was prudent to reserve my stay on the premises, although my customer loyalty cards recommended the hotel across from the golf course. Prices were not as low as many reviewers state for this hotel, two weeks prior the event but relatively expensive Friday and Saturday night stays (almost double the workweek day rate - and almost all hotels do this in Las Vegas, some more than others). Flights expensive from the East Coast this year, Saturday return some 100 cheaper than flying back on Sunday - and the red eye flights leave close to the date changeover time.The next shock came finding out about getting there from and to McCarran Intl. airport - it's apprx. 17 miles in distance, taxicab 60...70 when arriving late night! But what the hotel staff did not readily disclose - ther's a low-key bus (WestCliff Express) for two (2) dollars, that takes about 50 minutes (while still running along the highways) and makes its final scheduled stop less than a quarter mile/400m from the hotel entrance! Other participants of the convention took out rental cars (the hotel shuttle, price not known, last leaves hotel or airport by 6pm, so you're out of luck on eastbound red eye flights, that's where the bus really pulls its weight...)Enormous lobby areas greet you and hefty puffs of cigarette smoke - almost like good ole Europe (used to be...). The area appears more cluttered (efficiently equipped) with money machines than in some other hotels on and off the strip, making it a challenge to find your orientation and the concierge area, at first.Yes, the personnel really is friendlier here than in town, instead of the allocated room on the third floor, I requested one on a higher level and was granted one with an outstanding view of the golf course and the mountains. Clean room, with separate sink area vs shower/toilet area, albeit fixtures telling their heritage closer to the 80s than the 2000s. A flat screen TV (not HD)with a very limited program but a few music channels that are worth mentioning (and I couldn't turn it off at the end of a two night stay, not via remote or on the mainframe!) The biggest drawback were the enormous 4 AC motors below (the size of B757 engines) and their significant noise when at least two of the four fans were continuously running - mind, we had 107F (40C) outside temps during the day...Too bad, despite the weekend room rate surcharge, wi-fi was available only at another surcharge of 12,99/day, and amazingly, I managed without. No group discount (considering the conference) had been negotiated.A very opulent breakfast bar greets the all-nighter not before 8am on weekends, keep your gambling registration card handy as it will give you 2 meal discount, but prices are really reasonable for Las Vegas, the quantity or the quality. Likewise the prime rib dinner buffet, good job, guys! Please tip the friendly staff like Easterners...A solid good, not quite very good and I decisively wish to criticize the very draughty, excessively chilled conference rooms on the second floor (near the bingo hal) with no possibility of adjusting climate control clearly spells out that this hotel isn't latest generation any more.Would I recommend it heat-soaked LA drivers might find their sanctuary here, it's not close to the strip, but if you don't need access to downtown daily and are a little more cost conscious, this might just be your choice for a few days. Good luck in winning a jackpot!"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Great value,"Outstanding hotel. Stayed in a huge suite at a good price. Hotel and room were very clean. Room was quiet, no noise from the hall or other rooms. Excellent service: valet, bellman, room service, front desk. Front desk had two cribs in our room before our arrival. At most hotels, we have to call two or three times after arrival to get cribs delivered, no matter how often we have requested them ahead of time. Only issue: pool was not heated as much as needed."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Far From Strip but Nice,"I stayed with my sister in this hotel...Basically, as it was New Years, various other hotels closer to the the Strip were booked. The SunCoast staff were very helpful friendly, even when our flight was delayed and we had to reschedule our shuttle pick-up from the airport---use this! The SunCoast is very far from the airport and it is free so you will save yourself money.The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and spacious. The buffet downstairs was decent. The only downside is, again, its distance from the Strip. The shuttle times are not very convenient, especially if you want to spend a night on the town. The cab fare from the Strip to our hotel costs us around 30. So, keep that in mind.Hope this helps!"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,"What a great place for kids, exceptional offstrip value","With the movie theater, kids babysitter facility,bowling alley, swimming pool, casino, etc this was a very nice place, only 15 minutes from the strip. kid friendly swimming pool (which also had a pretty lively weeklly adult pool party) was nice. large clean rooms accomodated 4 people easily. the st tropez buffet food was very good and moderately pricedwe would definitely stay there again. a large shopping mall and other stores are less than 5 minutes away. beatiful view of both the strip at night and the mountains from our room. we also looked out over the pool area and a golf coursethe fitness center was just that. not a bike and treadmill like some places. they had treadmills, elliptical trainers and bikes as well as several weight machinesspa on site but i didnt get to try it out unfortunatelygive it a try and i know you wont be disappointed"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Great for the Family,"Enjoyed my stay at the Suncoast, I was in for a wedding with my daughter and there were plenty of things to do for the kids. I enjoyed the movie theater and bowling alley which kept us occupied in between family events. The rooms are very good as well. Ventilation was not the best in the casino on the first day and you could smell more smoke than normal."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Best Kept Secret !,"Suncoast is off the strip about 20-30 minutes depending on how you drive. Vegas is easy to get around if you do rent a car. I have stayed in several LV hotels both on and off the strip but I honestly can say I was surprised at how nice the rooms were. The views are spectacular - mountains and golf courses- very peaceful. I'm a corner checker - I hate to see dirt in the corners of the bathrooms - every square inch was spotless! The crisp snow white bed covers reassured me of the cleanliness. We felt like we had a suite by both the size and the amenities. As we kept late nights we wanted to sleep The choice of restaurants is nicely varied and even has a Seattle's Best for the coffee drinker. They bring in some great music bands. I can't say enough about the well mannered and pleasant staff. Despite the line up check in was quick and pleasant. Loved the pool hot tub with the views of the mountains. Close to great shopping (5 min walk) , 15 minute from Red Rock Canyon State Park( rock climbing, varied degrees of hiking easy to tough), 20 min to Bonnie Springs (rustic restaurant, zoo fun for all ages) I would recommend this hotel without reservation!"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,"Not bad, with improvements under way","Lots of activity under way to improve the hotel. They have some new eating places coming in soon. The new Game Place sports bar had great food and drinks. The bartender Angela was friendly and helpful.Rooms are spacious and quiet. Beds were comfortable when you are finally ready to crash. My room was clean and no complaints about maid service,I used the shuttle service to return to the airport and this was a nice savings over a cab or rental car.Downside / upside is that this is a LONG way from the strip. You can walk to a few places. A few gold courses are next door, with Angel Park and Badlands on either side. I would not want to stay here more than two nights without a car to get out more.The players club had ZERO points gifts except in small or medium sizes. How is that possible. F minus. Many employees were friendly and helpful. Room rates were very reasonable compared to the Strip."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,A 3 day Journey to get there but worth it,"Didn't do a review for our March/April visit but our stay for July/August was just as good and as always its like coming home to Family, our Maid Ada is an absolute star and looked after us to perfection, all the girls in the coffee shop are great and even have our order prepared if they seen us walking up for our morning coffee, special mention for Whitney who was good enough to take us shopping one day, Suncoast you have lots of real stars working here that make our trips great and even harder to leave on our long journey home,see you all in March 2018."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Home Away From Home,"The Suncoast Hotel and Casino has become our home away from home. We are treated like family on our return visits. It's nice to see familiar faces the casino staff and restaurant staff. We especially enjoy the Oyster Bar Restaurant. The hotel rooms are beautiful, comfortable, clean, and roomy. The golf course and mountain views are beautiful while having breakfast. We always rent a car to visit some of our favorite places. Enterprise rent a car is right up the road they pick you up at the hotel and drop you off when you are done with the car. The distance between the strip and downtown is REALLY not a problem. The location and atmosphere is laid back away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and there is a Cheesecake Factory across the street where we always visit at least once while we are there. All in all, if you visit Las Vegas to relax and do some casual gambling, this is a gem of a place to stay. We would highly recommend the Suncoast, but rent a car if you want to check out the rest of the city......Aloha!"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Great place away from the insanity of the Strip!,"My wife and I recently moved to Vegas, and come here fairly regularly. We recently visited Salvatore's Italian restaurant for our anniversary dinner. This place is right out of Good Fellas - great ambiance, and old school vibe with great food. We've never stayed here, but always enjoy gambling here and coming for an occasional drink, or to watch a movie at the theater."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Suncoast Hotel Casino is a great value in Las Vegas!,"I visited the Suncoast Hotel Casino in Las Vegas last weekend and was pleasantly suprised. The rooms are clean and the rates are great!I live in Las Vegas for my second home, and many times I bring friends to gamble here in Las Vegas. They all can't stay at my home, so we usually look for a local hotel and casino to stay at that is affordable.The Suncoast had great restaurants, clean rooms and winning slot machines at a low price.The only drawback I had was that as a non-smoker, the casino needs better ventiliation. It was very smoky in the casino area.Highly recommended!William Mahoney"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Wii admit when I'm wrong!,"I always joke with my parents since this is their hotel. My wife and I stayed there two nights and I have to say it was excellent. Room view was great. Lots to do for families (bowling, movies, arcade). Clearly not a Paris, Caesers, Belligio but then the prices aren't either. Lots of elderly people mixed in with families. It was a good change of pace from the strip and an entirely different feel (thats good and bad)."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Very nice hotel,"We stayed 4 nights and for the price it met far behine my expectation. Every thing is there for you right in this hotel. I love this hotel and I will be booking there again on my next trip to Las Vegas. They rooms are big and very clean. This hotel is great for a family trip,so much to see and do."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Fun Times,"Went to eat at their buffet. They have a variety of foods. Good food for a great price. If it's your first visit, you get a discount on the buffet. We also did a little bit of gambling. I was in town visiting family and they informed me of other things you can do such as bowl and catch a movie."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,Next time will stay somewhere else,"Stayed here because rooms were blocked for a wedding. When we entered, the casino was very smoky and hot. They definitely need to move the air around better. The restaurant offerings are limited and some of them don't run well. The service in the restaurants was very slow. The room itself was spacious, clean and well priced. We had one day for a pool day, the temperature was 94 degrees. Imagine our disappointment when we found the pool is shaded by the building the entire day! Also, the pool amenities were all closed down. Huge disappointment -- huge! We would not have stayed here if we would have known. I did have a wonderful massage and it was a great value. If you would like to have the massage of your life, go see Elvira! She is awesome."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,A Walk Back in Time,"I recently stayed at the Suncoast for three nights while working on a project in Las Vegas. The good points about this property are that it has plenty of parking (due to the casino), large rooms, great views from the back of the building, and good housekeeping service. The beds were fairly comfortable (but firm) but the pillows were very hard. Walking into the property however, is like a journey back in time. The decor is dated (brass fixtures everywhere) and the casino, registration, and dining areas are like standing in a chimney. There are so many people smoking in the casino, with so little ventilation, that the smell permeates almost the entire property. After a few minutes, my eyes were burning. Fortunately, the smell did not extend to the rooms (but it did to the hallways). Other negative aspects of the property are the very poor selection of TV channels and the poor set ups for working in the rooms. There is wireless internet but there are no power outlets near the desk or bedside tables. It is obvious that this property survives based on its clientele of older casino patrons. I would stay away unless I had a specific reason to be in this area."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Lovely place!,"I love the small size overall. This is my third time here because I tag along while my husband is at a conference. The pool is perfect, with full sun AND cabanas. There is a wide choice of restaurants and all are well served. We saw a movie while there and had a nice choice of current movies."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,"Honestly, surprising aside from the smoky casino","Big room, nice (enough) bed...the bathroom amenities were a bit odd (like they were the cheapest wholesale could buy. But this epitomizes off strip casino world. Nice enough staff. Cheap price. Clean.Hello jpm3x,We are pleased you enjoyed the service from the staff, the cleanliness of the property, and that you received a good value for the money you spent here. On your next visit, please see a property leader to discuss how we can make your next visit a five-star review."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Everything you could want in a hotel and casino,"Their is everything for everyone at the Sun Coast. Every amenity you could want or need ranging from small children to adults. From arcades, bowling alleys, and cheap gambling. A very nice place to enjoy Vegas away from the Strip. Also It is right across the street from some amazing golf courses along with shops and fine dining. A very good choice in my opinion!"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Home away from home,This it's the place to stay if you just wanted to relax and not do a whole lot of activities. The price is very decent since you're away from the strip (about a good 15+ mins. away). The rooms are clean and the staff are very friendly. Bowling alley and game room can keep the kids entertained. Ask for a room with golf course view.
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,Not A Happy Guest,"Today with the economy the way it is everyone is trying to make a dollar. That is understandable. My stay at the Suncoast lost its glitter when I was told I had to pay for a boarding pass to be printed. I could not believe that they do not include this courtesy for their guests. A daily charge of 5 was charged to my credit card. The explanation was that includes all local calls, a safe in the room, a small refrigerator and wi-fi. As far as I am concerned the refrigerator could be removed as a inclusion. I had a room that was extremely noisy and asked to be moved. It took them hours to get this accomplished. I refused to gamble there after being told about the charge for the printing of the boarding pass. We had dinner at the Red Rock and I decided to try and see if they would print my pass for me. I didn't think they would do it but I was shocked. They never asked me for money or even if I was staying there at the hotel as a guest. I explained to the desk clerk what had happened and they couldn't believe it. I was told they print lots of boarding passes for people as a courtesy not just guests of their hotel. This finished me with the Suncoast. I will never dtay there again while in Vegas. It's the principle of the thing that matters. They could have gained my respect and lots more business from my office. There is no reason for this to happen. It is not good PR at all. The Red Rock has all of my future business. No wonder the Republicans didn't go to the Suncoast. The Red Rock rolled out the carpet and knows how to treat people.Thank you for your feedback, and your comments. We do apologize your experience was unsatisfactory. I do want you to know we take all comments as an informational tool to help serve our customers in a more efficient way."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Enjoyed our stay,"Everyone was very friendly and our room was nice and clean. My room had yellow sinks and toilet and a phone in the bathroom just like the 70's and 80's Vegas. Would definitelygo back. The only drawback was the breakfast buffet. Although it was given to us free for the first night the food was lousy. Du Pars was a much better choice.Thank you for your review! We appreciate it. If you have any advice on how we can earn that last star, then please let us know, because our goal is to provide you with five-star service."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Nice Off the Strip Hotel,"We have stayed at this hotel many times. I think it's great for families. My son loves the small arcade, bowling alley, movie theatre, pool and Friday's restaurant. I love the fact that the rooms are large, very clean and come with a small fridge. It is also great for families to have the shower and toilet area seperate. In addition to Friday's restaurant there are other restaurants including a 24 hour cafe and an ice cream shop that stays open late as well, very convenient. There are also shopping centers near the hotel that include just about every store and restaurant you can think of, Target, PF Changs, Mimi's etc. My parents had an odd numbered room and it overlooked the pool and golf course. My even numbered room overlooked a roof, not so nice. This is really the only negative I can think of. Also, pool area has no lifeguard or supervision of any kind, so some adults got a little unruly, drinking beer in the pool, speaking loudly etc. But, overall this is a nice place to stay off the strip, especially for those traveling to Las Vegas with children."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Great stay,Very easy check in. Room was clean and comfortable. Service from all employees was good. The food choices are great. The Italian place (Salvatore's I think ) was amazing. Great food and prices with impeccable service. Highly recommended!
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Fantastic room with a view!,"I stayed here for a couple of comp'd nights and had heard that the rooms were remodeled, so I was looking forward to it and had somewhat lofty expectations. I was admittedly impressed. The room was larger than expected, tastefully decorated, and had a great view of the golf course next door and the mountains beyond. It had a good-sized desk in the corner nearest the floor-to-ceiling windows and a real rolling desk chair as opposed to a more common wooden chair. The internet speed was decent, although I had to call support for connectivity assistance. Cox support got me online quickly. The bathroom was even spacious and had two sinks, a large tub/shower, and roomy toilet area. The whole room was just great! The housekeeping staff was fantastic, getting me whatever I asked for quickly. Check-in and check-out was quick and easy and everyone was cheerful, polite, and helpful! As for the casino, the sports book area was large and not overly busy. There was a limited amount of table games, but the common, basic ones were all there. The St. Tropez Buffet was great for the price and everything was tasty and fresh! If you're looking for a golf getaway place to stay, or just someplace away from the craziness of the strip and don't want to spend a fortune,THIS IS IT! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is for the limited amount of table games. Otherwise, it's 5+ stars all the way!"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Seeking sunshine,"My wife and I live in Vancouver, BC, Canada. We regularly vacation in Las Vegas because of the climate. We discovered the Suncoast several years ago and stay there frequently. The casino offers tons of entertainment, has bowling, several movies theatres, great restaurants and is surrounded by awesome golf courses. The Suncoast is located in Summerlin which is the best neighbourhood in Las Vegas. Needless to say, we love it. We will absolutely be back.Thank you for visiting us! We look forward to you visiting again."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Wonderful family hotel for Las Vegas,We had a wonderful stay at the Suncoast our hotel room was facing the pool and the views were absolutely perfect. It's very nice to visit Las Vegas and kind of get out of the rat race of downtown. Nice location about 20 minutes from the strip. Hotel was very clean plenty of stuff for the kids to do also the arcade was inexpensive and the gentleman that work there was very helpful. The pool area was beautiful and they also have bowling with tons of lanes and a movie theater which neither did we get to explore. We were there to visit family and kind of busy running around. I would Highly recommend this hotel to people visiting with kids to Las Vegas. Pictures are Views from our room 455. The only reason I did not give it an excellent is because you have to walk through the casino to get to the hotel room and you feel like you smoke a few cigarettes by the end of the Walk. I'm not a cigarette smoker
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,For the price...WOW!,"Truly a magnificent hotel. Beautiful, spacious rooms massive bathrooms. Not anywhere near the strip, but if you are a hiker/climber, this a great location to access the Red Rock Canyon/Spring Mountain Recreation areas. Would go back in a heartbeat. Stay away from the tight slots though."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Comfortable an affordable,"Needed a place in the Summerlin area for a visit with relatives. The room was clean and spacious (we were also upgraded to a suite at the last minute). Views of the strip or mountains, or both if you get a suite. Well located for west Vegas activities. Good restaurants at the hotel and nearby. Will definitely stay there again."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Great Off-Strip Hotel,"Lives up to all the previous reviews: large, quiet rooms with great view friendly staff little dated extremely smoky casino older crowd. We stayed for 6 nites. We hit the Strip on a couple of evenings and didn't mind the 20 min drive back to our hotel."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Off the beaten path but very nice!,With several shows going on everything near the strip that is reasonable was sold out.I stay at Coast Casino hotels most often when in Vegas so decided to try the suncoast. Yes it is a bit off the beaten path but you're back in the action in 15 minutes... That said the rooms are big as are the bathrooms the staff is super friendly and the restaurants are great...If you like Golf...you're right next door to Angel Park Golf club...didn't have the time to try it out but the reviews are good.
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Decent hotel. Nothing fancy. Just the basics,Decent hotel. Nothing fancy. Just the basics. Even the casino area is quite small and only has basic games and machines. If you need a clean room to just sleep in. This is the place. If you need excitement. Then this is not the place for you.
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,more for your money!!!!!,"I am sitting in my room at the Suncoast as I write this reveiw to you, via high speed internet service provided by the hotel at a 9.99 fee. ( a bargin since I probably saved 100 over the 24 hour period, by using my computer instead of gambling!!)Trip advisor is my travelers bible. I was surprised at any negative comments about the Suncoast, but most were positve witch steered me to give it a try.We checked in Monday, Sept. 26 and will depart today Sept. 28.Since it is off season and during the week, we may have not experienced the heavey smoke ,bad service or disgrundled staff some have written about.The rooms are huge, bathrooms gigantic, and the beds are heavenly.(must be a coast hotel trait, Barbary coast has same beds)We booked through trip reservations , paid 44 a night, received a coupon book upon arrival that had a free luch buffet and other offers.The buffet was wonderful.We have stayed on the strip, done all the fancy dancy hotels and wanted to try someplace the locals recommended that had all the amenities we wanted for a decent price. We found it right here.This is video poker heaven!We ordered the American Casino Guideoff the internet which was filled with valuable gambling information and 2 for one coupons for rooms and food, and gamming. We used Suncoast coupons, and had a fabulous dinner buffet (Tues Filet Mingion ,Prime Rib Seafood etc) , 2 for 1 , saved 15., at the Rampart nex door.We are going to use a coupon and stay at the Las Vegas Club downtown on fremont street when we leave here. 49 for both nights or 59 for newer tower rooms.Another valuable sight is Cheapo Las vegas , which will critic everything down to the buffets in Vegas. Along with Trip Advisor, and American Casino guide ,our trip is just costing us mostly gambling expense.We are looking forward to trying the other Coast hotels because our experiences so far have been positive.So to some it up, if you want to get away from the strip, want a great place to stay, want to take in a movie (18 screen movie theater), comfy beds,decent price, high speed internet, perfect size workout room, great air conditioning, good food at great prices and on and on this is the place for you!Hope you have as much fun as we have had!!!"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,2,Clean but Smelly,"This hotel needs a better ventilation system!! The whole place smelled of smoke and farts. I found the casino to be very dreary and outdated. The rooms were very clean and we had a nice view. We had breakfast there and the smell of smoke permeated the restaurant so bad it was hard to eat. I wouldn't stay here again, for sure."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Great meeting facility,"I stayed her while coordinating a class in one of the hotel's meeting rooms. As the meeting planner, I was upgraded to a wonderful room on the 10th floor. It had a bar, living room, dining area, large separate bedroom and a huge bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a huge shower. The bed was very comfortable. The meeting facility is very well run, and worth consideration if you have an event. While there is a large selection of restaurants in the casino, I only patronized two: The Cafe Sienna served up a decent, inexpensive early bird breakfast special. The Bagel Cafe Express has pretty good sandwiches, although they seemed a bit pricey. Otherwise, I preferred to get out and eat somewhere else. Across the street are a Cheesecake Factory and a Gordon Biersch Brewpub that are both great places to eat."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,"great hotel, lovely rooms with great views",firstly try to park at the front (not the side) of the hotel if you can or in the garage which has direct access to the casinothe smoke from the casino floor doesn't tend to filter into the lifts and upper floors unlike in some of the downtown casinosthe rooms are very large and well appointed. those facing west have a great view of the las vegas stripwe got an early check in at noon which was good and the process was handled in a friendly but efficient way. ac in room was very efficient and the rooms were quiet when we were therelots of eating choices in the casino and surrounding area but you do need a car in order to take advantage of this as the distances and temperatures make walking a difficult optionhowever the local bus does appear to go to the airport on a regular basis and the casino also offered a shuttle there as wellrecommended
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Great View of Golf Course Mountains,"Had a Comp Night at the Suncoast, 2 Queen Sized Bed room. Room seems to be larger than most vegas hotel rooms. Large Bathroom, Clean Quiet... Pool area seems a little small for the average Vegas Hotel, but also offers a hot tub. Casino a bit smoky, perhaps ventilation system can be turned on higher."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Great place!,"I stayed for three days and I quite enjoyed it. It's quite a distance from the Strip but the mellowness and the view from my room was worth it. Although the decor in the rooms were a little outdated, they were very clean and very SPACIOUS! The one thing I liked about the rooms was that it did not have the adjoining locked doors to the next room, so privacy was well in tact. The safe and fridge were also a plus. Adding to the spaciousness, the bathrooms was quite also large. I had two sinks in one area and then the toilet and shower in a separate part of the bathroom separated by a door. I ate at the buffet for the three days I was there. The selection of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner was the same each day but was worth the price especially if you signed up for the casino card. You can't beat eating at a buffet for 8+ for breakfast and 11+ for dinner. Sorry, I could not remember how much I paid exactly, but know for sure that it was way cheaper to eat there than at one of the buffets at the Strip. I'd definately stay here again!"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,1,Beware!,"Something is seriously wrong with the hotel in this casino! Customer service in the casino is outstanding in the hotel not so much. Left our room at 8am to go to the Grand Canyon for the day. Upon returning at 9pm that night found our hotel room door open with the lock holding the door open! Checked the room and it appeared everything was still intact. Talk to the night supervisor at the front desk about it. She told us there was nothing she could do about it and she would call security. Security met us at our room. Talked to us, checked the room and they decided it was no big deal as nothing was missing! So I guess they think it's ok for your room to be open when you are not there! And for at least 8 hrs too. They treated us like we were scamming them or something. Talked to casino night supervisor about it and finally got someone who actually cared. But could give us no answers until she talked to the casino manager.Casino manager finally called next day and said she would comp our room for one night. Well to make this long story short, night was not comped ended up paying for our full 4 nights! I asked to talk to the casino manger again but was told they would not be in until noon. I will never stay in this hotel again nor will I gamble here either. If you stay here lock all your valuables up in the safe. And be prepared for terrible customer service if anything does go wrong. Casino manager did call back later in the day and did comp two nights but I find the actions of the front desk supervisor as well as the security people unacceptable! Also every one acted like it was not a big deal. Maybe they should have someone leave their front doors open all day and see how they feel about that!Thank you for taking the time to post your comments. We apologize for any inconveniences you experienced during your stay. Please be assured that finding your room open is of great concern, and we have advised all appropriate departments of your specific situation. At no time did we think you were scamming or something of that nature. While we can understand your frustrations, please understand there are policies and procedures to be followed in a situation like this. We hope you enjoyed the rest of your trip, the Grand Canyon must have been amazing to see in person!"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,EXCELLENT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY,"We just stayed at the Suncoast. The room are very spacious and clean. We had a deluxe King size room - the room, with the pull out couch could easily sleep a family of four. The room we clean and well maintained.We dined at the Italian restaurant - the food was good and the service was about the same. The casino is clean and well vented. The floor service is a little slow, but that is very common now a days."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Repeat Customers,"I can't say enough about the Suncoast!! My brother lives in Las Vegas, so as far as the Strip - we have been there, done that. If you are a first time visitor, then by all means, stay on the Strip if you want that Classic Las Vegas vibe. But if you frequent Las Vegas and would prefer a fabulous view of the mountains in Red Rock Canyon, no traffic and great value - then consider a stay at the Suncoast. We (my husband, myself and two children) have stayed there 4 times in the past few years and my parents stay there at least three times each year when they visit. You can't beat the low room rates, and the rooms are HUGE and very nice. The hotel has a large casino, friendly staff and a very nice selection of upscale restaurants, midrange restaurants, even a hot dog stand in the casino near the sportsbook. The pool and hot tub are very nice and never crowded. There is a movie theater and bowling alley. They also have a nightclub and on several occasions, my folks have enjoyed some great concerts at a very low ticket price. They saw the Lettermen and Jay and the Americans and raved about both shows.The only downside is the distance from the Strip - which is probably a 30 minute cab ride. But you are still close to shopping across the street at Tivoli Gardens, which also has some nice restaurants. If you want to explore Red Rock Canyon, do some hiking or horseback riding, or play golf, this would be a great place to stay. We have never had a bad time at Suncoast."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Great Place away from Noisy strip,"I stayed here mid May for a large planned Birthday Party. I arrived at 2:00 pm for a room which I had pre-paid for and they were out of rooms so they can me an upgrade to a 10th Floor Penthouse suite at no extra cost, it was amazing and very large.I had come a few years later for a weekend function but stayed next door at the Marriott. Suncoast is almost as nice but far cheaper.Sunday Brunch was OK but a good deal for 19.00 ( you get a discount at all restaurants if you get their free membership card). I didn't try other restaurants. They are building a lot of Shops and restaurants across the street.I like the area as well, quiet and close to Red Rock Canyon."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,"loved it ,","I stayed may and June,enjoyed it so much that we are talking about coming back next year,staff very friendly,food at the buffett very good and reasonable prices,room very clean and nice,enjoyed the pool and hot tub, parking not an issue,plenty of shopping around the hotel no complaints,highly recommend it thanks cathy and sheldon"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,a walk through the casino,"The hotel was clean and we had at our request a quiet room, room service was good. We don't gamble and really didn't care for being required to have to walk through the smoke filled casino, or even just the casino to get to our room.It seems that your experience was not up to our high standards, and I sincerely apologize for that! We strive for five-star experiences with every guest every time. If you have feedback on how we can improve, please reach out. Otherwise, we hope youll visit again to give us another chance to wow you!"
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,4,Unexpected pleasure!,We received two free weekend nights from Suncoast. Our room was spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable. Whenever we saw an employee they greeted us and were willing to assist! We had to book an extra night and it was very reasonable. I experienced Pure Spa which is on site. WOW! They offered a great combo spa treatment which was to die for! The buffet resturant was also better then expected. Usually buffets are pretty boring but theirs was actually pretty good!
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,Who Maid the Bed,"Stayed at the Suncoast for a week in Feb. 2003. A big, impressive building but understand that it is about a good 20 minute drive on expressways to get to the strip. You will be at the extreme northwest section of the Las Vegas area making it time consuming to get to other parts of the city, but from what we saw this is probably the nicest area in greater Las Vegas (shopping, golf courses, restaurants). Good amenities at the Suncoast, the restaurants in the casino were all great and a good value. Bowling center, movie theatre, nice pool/spa area. Our only reservations concerned the (standard) room we had. The bed had unfitted sheets and mattress pad that just slid all over the mattress and bunched up. The first three nights whoever made the bed left the sheets a foot short at the bottom so that our feet were on the mattress pad. The carpeting looked a bit trafficked. Still, our overall experience was good."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,5,Quiet off the strip hotel,"We spent several nights at this hotel. We loved the location about 8 miles away from the strip, but easy drive. You do need a car if you stay at this property. It is far from most everything else. Plenty of places to eat in the area. Located in a beautiful place near golf course. We had a nice view of the mountains and Las Vegas strip. We found it quiet at night, even though we were there over a weekend, and there were families with young children staying at the hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly, and helpful. We found our room to be large, and clean. Bathroom was large and had double vanity. It is not the most fancy of rooms, but it had everything we needed. A fridge, coffee maker, flat screen TV. We ate at a couple of the restaurants in the hotel and they were good, the buffet breakfast was very good variety for the money. We saw a show at the showroom, every seat is a good one. We used the pool which was very nice, not the biggest one but nicely decorated and plenty of seats. Overall very happy and would stay again."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,Edc weekend 2017,"I just got back from my 4 night stay here at the SunCoast hotel. I have to say that rooms are spacious, nice and very clean. Valet staff was also nice and was understanding when I forgot a couple items and the gentlemen who helped us carry our bags was very kind and welcoming as well. On the other hand, costumer service is very bad.Front desk staff is horrible. At some point, there was three families in line and all three of the front desk agents were looking at their computer screens completely ignoring that they had guests waiting to check in and check out for about 5 minutes (didn't even look up once). One afternoon I tried to order room service at around 2:40 and to my surprise the lady on the phone advised me that there wasn't anyone to take my order at the moment. So If i wanted to eat I had to go downstairs to the restaurant. At the restaurant, the staff was welcoming. They seated us quickly. But their attention to detail was missing. I had asked for a drink with ice and they would forget the ice. I order a plate a fruit which they completely forgot and tried to charge me for it. Thankfully I remember and got the charge voided. At the check out, a lady with white hair helped me and when I asked her for a bill she replied in a rude tone, Yeah! That's what I'm doing. Might not sound like a bad response but it's the way the person says it that has a bad effect. When I first arrived I immediately thought this was a beautiful hotel. Which it is, but I do believe the staff needs to have some costumer service orientations. (Or perhaps consider hiring younger more friendly people). Hello Angy F,Thank you for your recent visit and for leaving such thorough feedback! At Suncoast, we view all criticism as constructive and rely on it to provide better service and entertainment for our guests. Our team members strive to be friendly and personable during every interaction and are taught that service should always be prompt and accurate.

Your comments will be forwarded to the appropriate management so that they can address and resolve the issues you have reported. Again, I apologize that you were not able to enjoy the high quality service Suncoast has become known for but urge you to visit in the future to experience the improvements caused by your comments."
Suncoast Hotel and Casino,3,Last year for annual Suncoast stay,"We stay at this property at least once a year when we head to Vegas to visit family. We like the location, off the strip in more of the residential area. The rooms have recently been renovated with an updated dcor. The rooms are very spacious and we have never had a problem with noise. The pool never seems crowded. The food is average. Sunrise breakfast for 3.99 in the caf, but you have to know about it as it is not on the menu. We are members of their BConnected players program and do receive the occasional perk, however be aware that anything you win ie. breakfast buffets, have to be used the following day. Other casinos vouchers are good for a longer period of time. Years ago I used to win money or break even, not so for the past few years. We had an issue with our bill at check-out, as we do every year. Someone had visited a bar and charged it to our room. The front desk gal said she'd look into it and within an hour was corrected. My only negative comment is how unwilling they are to satisfy a customer issue. Tried to use buffet coupons one day after expiration. We were told to go to the players club and see about getting comps...were told NO. We had a 15.00 food credit on the room which apparently was only good for that particular date (we used it the day before) and upon check-out was charged to the room. I explained that we were not told it could only be used for that particular date as our stay was for more that one day. NO credit. Very poor customer service considering the size of Boyd properties. Pretty sure 15.00 isn't going to break them and I don't like feeling cheated. This will definitely be a deciding factor for our next trip. Plenty of places to choose from when visiting Las Vegas. Suncoast isn't the only game in town!"
Rodeway Inn Oceanview,1,Horrible,I hate it very disappointed. It is a dump I wouldn't suggest this place to my worst enemy!!
Rodeway Inn Oceanview,1,Consider a better hotel,Try to avoid unless you absolutely have to.
Rodeway Inn Oceanview,3,"Could have been worse, just ok","The room was decent as far as cleanliness, however, the room was very small with two beds and there was no closet or rack to hang up your clothing. It was ok, since we were there to attend a concert and shop at outlet, so the room served the purpose. I must say the bathroom was in great shape, there was no mold or mildew in the tub and it appeared that the room and bathroom had a fresh coat of paint and the tub was new. It served the purpose"
Rodeway Inn Oceanview,4,Great experience!,"I was VERY nervous about choosing this hotel because of the negative reviews. But we were pleasantly surprised! A group of friends and I (girls, early 20s) stayed here on Saturday 12/28 and our total room cost was 115. We chose Rodeway because it was only a mile away from Bader Field where Life in Color was. The rooms were very clean! Outdated, but clean. Beds were actually pretty comfortable! Didn't use the TV. The bathrooms were also very clean. The shower's water pressure wasn't the best, but we dealt with it. Check in and check out went very quickly and smoothly. Not the friendliest people, but they got the job done. We found a place to park right outside of our room which was great. Parking is 10 which is annoying but you have to pay to park ANYWHERE in Atlantic City so I didn't mind. Anything beats paying 700 a night at Revel (that was their rate on the same night!!!). We were barely in our room all night, so this hotel is perfect for a group of friends who are just looking for a place to shower, pregame, and sleep. I wouldn't recommend this place to a couple only because it's not really romantic or anything. It's very basic, which is what we were looking for. There is a free breakfast but of course we didn't wake up early enough (ends at 10), however there was still fresh, hot coffee at 12pm when we checked out which was nice. This place is definitely NOT a 5-star hotel, but it's also not bad either. And no, we didn't see any hookers!"
Rodeway Inn Oceanview,1,bad customer service,This was worst hotel. Te service no good. They need training customer service.
Rodeway Inn Boardwalk,1,BE CAREFUL DO NOT STAY HERE,"Where to begin!!! What a filthy rat trap hotel.Literally.In my bathroom window there was edible RAT poison in the open,not to mention the 1 inch Gap under the front door.Upon arrival the parking lot looked like a dump yard.Toilets,mattress',TV's,bottles,condom wrappers were everywhere.The room smelled terrible,I've seen thicker paper towels the the rags in the bathroom.I was afraid to put my bag on the carpet. Fortunately there was a table to leave my bag on. The clincher was on our way out to dinner a maroon cadilac pulls up a 4 of the most disgusting prostitutes get out ready to ply there trade.I stood there in amazement while the pimp told them exactly what was expected of them that nigh,. Again,Please DO NOT STAY HERE"
Rodeway Inn Boardwalk,3,You get what you pay for,"Stayed for one night on a business trip. It was worth 60 a night with tax on a Friday, Very minimum small room. Looks renovated but the bathroom needs a lot of work! No wifi even though the front desk gave me a password it don't even work! The area is pretty sketchy not the best around!!! Summer is probably a little better. Breakfast was just coffee and one muffin.... Everything is small here I suggest to stay at a casino hotel next time."
River Hotel,5,Cubs retreat!,"For us it was a fabulous location getting on rail to Cubs game and shopping for what we wanted to do. It's was easily accessible for dining as well Everyone in the hotel was very kind and were able to help with any questions we had Hello Pam D,We are glad our location made your visit to Chicago ideal for your Cubs game! Our service level is something we pride ourselves on and glad it showed during your trip. We hope to see you next time in town!"
River Hotel,4,Perfect Location !!,This hotel is in a perfect location to downtown Chicago - couldn't ask for better!The public transportation/train system is excellent and the hotel is a short 5-10 minute walk to many of the lines.I took the train from O'Hare and it was super easy !My room was a basic Club Quarters room - standard amenities.The staff was very friendly and helpful.I would most definately stay there again on my next trip to Chicago -
River Hotel,5,Nice neighborhood,The hotel is right across the river from the Trump Hotel. It's a 50 cab ride from the airport. Watched a Cubs game while there. Wrigley field wasn't too far away by taxi. Plenty of shopping and dining in the area. There is a Irish Pub just around the corner from the hotel. Across the street is a running / walking path along the river. Great for people watching. Would stay here again.
River Hotel,1,Noisy hotel,"I stayed at the hotel three nights. I was very disappointed by the level of noise at night. The doors were EXTREMLY loud. I could not get to sleep my second night there because I heard doors shut the entire night. I was on the 25th floor. In addition to the noise, the hotel somehow lost my reservation in their system and I had to escalate the issue all the way up to management to get it resolved. It wasn't easy. I will never stay at a Club Quarters hotel again."
River Hotel,4,Nice room,"the room is very nice. It's very modern and a bit on the side of a luxurious room. there's a Keurig Coffee machine. The room is relatively small, but I would say this is norm for downtown Chicago. I'm paying maybe 170/night before taxes and fees."
River Hotel,3,Extremely basic,"The place looked promising from the approach its right on the river, facing the beautiful River North area. The building, built way back when, is charming from the outside. And the lobby, while not grand, is also appealing. Once I got into my room, though ho hum.It isnt terrible, but there just is not one thing about it that makes it the least bit special. I had a small room, which was fine, but it was just very bland. The bed covering is one of those bad synthetic things, there were only two limp pillows on the bed stuff like that. There wasnt even an iron or board in the room. The place just felt very cheap and kind of sad. My rate was 200, which was less than other properties the weekend I stayed. But in retrospect, I should have paid an extra 30 to stay at a place that felt more upbeat. My only plusses were: its location, the fact that I was able to check in early, and free internet. Those arent strong enough factors, though next time Im in Chicago, Ill stay somewhere else. C-minus."
River Hotel,5,Amazing hotel,"The hotel is one of the best hotels I have stayed in. The location is great and you can easily walk to all the main attractions. It is right by the river which is a nice view. The room was really modern and clean. There was a coffee machine in the room and the hotel provided complementary fruits and soda and water. The staff were really friendly and helpful. I would defiantly go back there and highly recommend it.Thank you, Alex F, for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to post a review. We are thrilled to know you enjoyed the accommodations, prime location and friendly staff. We sincerely appreciate your high recommendation and we look forward to seeing you on your next visit!"
River Hotel,4,Two bathroom kitchenette suite,"Staying over night with a few ladies (co-workers, friends) while attending a multi-day convention. This room was perfect for our needs. A king, a queen, a sitting area with pull out couch made everyone comfortable. Two bathrooms allowed everyone a little more time to get ready for the next day. Kitchenette was convenient to make an instant oatmeal for the next morning. Very comfortable beds. Complimentary purified chilled water near the elevator was a nice touch.Thank you, Chris9767 for choosing the River Hotel. We are delighted to hear you found the accommodations and hotel amenities to your liking. We appreciate you taking the time to post a review and look forward to welcoming you back soon.Kind regards,"
River Hotel,4,Dilemma Value/Location Vs Lack of Sleep,We chose this hotel based on the price and location. It certainly lived up to our expectations. It was by far the best value for money I could find with most other hotels almost double. Given we would be out and about most days we just wanted something decent we could get a good sleep in and was clean.River Hotel check in was quick and easy. After a long flight we asked for a quiet room that had a great view when we woke up.We got a room with a view of the alley way and some kind of air con vents outside (1011). Whatever the air con thing was outside had a constant hum and it would drive anyone crazy.The air con in the room was the only thing noisier! Impossible to sleep with it on even with the supplied ear plugs. It's not the city noise that's the problem it's these two things.We loved the free filtered water and bottles.So overall looking back on this trip I think the value and location win out ever so slightly. Maybe a different room would make a difference to this review overall of the hotel.
River Hotel,5,Excellent location,"Perfect hotel for a single female traveller. The hotel was clean, convenient, and steps away from major attractions. Easy to access by public transportation. The room is smaller than average, but not too small, and the perfect size for a traveller who is not planning on spending much time in the hotel room anyway. Computers with internet access a plus. Friendly staff. The only gripe I had was the elevators...there are only two of them, so visitors can wait a while for them to arrive."
River Hotel,3,If you want to save money stay here!,"I've stayed in so many Chicago hotels I lost count. This location is excellent. The front desk staff was very helpful and hip. Room very modern, large and included a fridge and pull out comfy chair. Parking was only 36 per 24 hours here. Recalling that you are in a big city here and not some country estate, would night noise from the Loop be a surprise Would a panhandler on the sidewalk be a shock Of course not. If these things are disturbing to you, don't stay here. If you crave peace and quiet, four star ambiance and price, you should go up to the Peninsula. The Italian restaurant in the building is very charming and did I mention the building is an architectural masterpiece by Herbert Hugh Riddle, 1928 Its a gem."
River Hotel,3,Nostalgia in modern Chicago,"As being a guest in Chicago, you can afford the luxury of spending a couple of hours on the architectural tour through downtown Chicago. The first building they tell you about is the River hotel. Situated opposite the Trump tower, you get a feeling of the grandeur of the 1920s, when the hotel was build. It must have had the same strange feeling, you now get from the Trump tower. Ugly, grotesque, aiming at the very rich and symbolizing something which does not exist and proves to be a dream. While we now call the building historical nostalgia with its weird toptower as of floor 24, the hotel offers a mixture of the old and the new. The old is the buildings shape and elevators, the various signs and sometimes not well maintained emergency staircases. The new offering a business floor, the tiny modernized reception room, the good quality Wi-Fi and free water they serve. And it is this indecisiveness which makes or breaks this hotel. Either do the modern streak or go completely back into the history of 1920's. We were staying on a high floor and really getting in the top of the building, you are offered small floors with smaller rooms. Due to the height, rooms tend to be windy even with closed windows. The room was ok, but why this old fashioned ugly bathroom Why do they forget a bedside table and when asked for and promised, the thing, it never showed up Why have a decent desk but not enough electricity points To be fair the prices are reasonable for downtown Chicago but the hotel just misses the finesses to make it to a four star. The view from the window was amazing but the cold wind chilled up the room sometimes to an uncomfortable temperature. My advice would be stay low.Hello LowieSantiagoChile,Thank you for providing us with feedback on your stay. We are continually working to enhance the guest experience and will use your comments to do so. We hope to see you back next time you come to town."
River Hotel,5,Really nice for very little,"The room was nice although a little bit small. The employees were very nice. It was really nice to have snacks, sodas, coffee and water at all times. The price was really good realeated to the services. I definitely recommend it.Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your recommendation. I am happy to know you enjoyed the complimentary amenities as well as the staff services. Please come see us again!"
River Hotel,4,Perfect first time visit to Chicago,"This unassuming hotel is well located for sightseeing, restaurants and views of the Chicago River and the river walk. The rooms are comfortable with basic amenities and free wi-fi but best suited for one person. A guest lounge on the second floor offers a large lobby, TV, computer terminals and an array of snacks, fruit, beverages. The highest praise is reserved for the front desk staff - Ramon and Diego were friendly and competent making restaurant suggestions that were delicious (Benny's Chop House).Dear Jeri G, thank you for taking the time to write a review and especially the kind words you had for Roman, Diego and the staff. There is nothing we love more than being able to share wonderful comments like yours with the staff and we will be sure the team sees it. We are so glad you choose The River Hotel for your first visit to Chicago as our prime location makes an ideal base for experiencing all the city has to offer. We look forward to welcoming you back soon!"
River Hotel,5,weekend getaway,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. This was our second trip to Chicago, but our first at The River Hotel. The room was small, but the dcor and the view made up for it. The staff was very friendly, not a single person passed us without saying hello and asking us how we were. The concierge desk was fantastic! Tim was amazing, his recommendations were spot on, he helped us with directions, whether it was taking the train, a bus or walking. It was refreshing to have the help when you are travelling. Roman was also very helpful. We will definitely be staying here again."
River Hotel,5,Awesome hotel location.,We stayed the weekend at the River Hotel and could not have been happier. The staff at the front desk was amazing. They provided us with coupons for a free appetizer or dessert at Lou Malnatis. They also provided some great recommendations for breakfast. The room was great. It was a little small but all Chicago rooms are small. It was clean and had a great view of the river and the Trump building across the river. The bed was comfortable. The location was close to all the downtown attractions with a big bus double decker bu stop right across the street.
River Hotel,4,Fantastic Location!,Overall I was quite pleased with the River Hotel. The location alone makes this hotel worth it. Its located right by the Chicago river 1 block from the Magnificent Mile. There is even a Double Decker trolly stop right near the hotel.The rooms were smaller then normal but there werent uncomfortably small. The bathroom was a decent size and the room had everything I could have wanted.Maid staff was fantastic and left extra towels as requested.Bella Bacino restuarant is located within the hotel and we had a fabulous Chicago style deep dish pizza there.My only concern with the hotel was its hard to see when driving down Wacker drive. Its well hidden. If you cross the Magnificent mile you have gone too far. As well when checking in we had reserved 3 rooms and they were showing a record of only 2 rooms. They did work towards figuring things out but it did take some time. Once we were given our rooms we were told we had 3 rooms with a queen size bed and a sleeper chair. Unfortunatly 2 of the rooms didnt have sleeper chairs so we had to go back to the front desk and be relocated again. It was a bit of a pain but nothing terrible. They did have a secured area on the 3rd floor to store luggage after checking out so that we could still tour the city.All in all a great expericen for the price.
River Hotel,5,Try River Hotel!!! You'll be glad you did!!,I have visited Chicago often in the past and always have booked a different hotel.I am glad I changed this time and booked The River Hotel in Chicago.I was pleasantly greeted by a clean crisp modern room that offered plenty of space. I must also add that this is a green Hotel with lots of Green features built in.Some of the details of our stay included:Security system that only allows guests of that floor to enter that floor.Purified water provided at each floor.A coffee pot in the main room.... Not in the bathroom.A refrigerator and microwave.Luxury comforter.Comfortable chair that folds out into single bed.A greeting welcoming us on the voice mail system. A greeting giving us details about Sunday and late checkout.Available Ipads for guest use.The toiletries/ shampoo / lotion is high quality.The staff was friendly on checkout and there were no extra charges.This hotel provides a great room at a good price.Give this hotel a try!
River Hotel,3,Previous reviews generally correct,"We chose this hotel based on location and cost. Traditionally we prefer hotels that have more comfort and amenities. The Pros:Location (is really excellent)QuietFriendly staffTasty restaurant downstairsThe Cons:The bed/bedding not horrible, but I just couldn't get a good night's sleepOur room smelled faintly of smokeThe elevator took foreverIt was all really just 'good enough.' It was the location that mattered most in the end. It was very easy to walk to almost all of our sight seeing destinations."
River Hotel,4,good hotel in excellent location,Beautiful art-deco building on the river with big rooms and a marvelous view at the rivers and skyscrapers -should ask at arrival room with view.
River Hotel,1,BED BUGS,"So this hotel is pretty nice to look at, and the staff was very friendly, however, we entered the room (very small) and continued to look at the room. We lifted up the sheets and it was clean and mattress was clean, however in the box spring of the bed, there was a swarm of bed bugs that once we flashed the light on them they all dove into the box spring. We continued and the front desk and they upgraded our room, however due to our disgust we arranged a booking at the Hyatt Regency down the road which was beyond clean. Thank you Front desk for your efforts to accommodate, but we could not deal with the bed bugs in your hotel.Guest feedback is important to us and we take any comment regarding bedbugs seriously. We have a proactive pest elimination policy that includes regularly scheduled inspections by a professional pest control company. Additionally we have thoroughly trained all of our housekeeping associates to inspect our guest rooms for any signs of pest activity. If necessary, our pest control company conducts bed bug elimination procedures using the latest in pesticide technology.I encourage anyone with questions or comments regarding our pest control policy to contact me directly at 312.777.0805 . RespectfullyAnna HampsonHotel Manager - River Hotel"
River Hotel,1,Stay here if you don't mind crappy service,"I recently stayed at the Club Quarters while in Chicago for a family gathering. This hotel was a major disappointment for several reasons:1) They don't honor their commitments. I had reserved a room with a queen size bed through Expedia, but was given a room with two twin beds instead. The excuse: they ran out of bedspreads for queen size beds (how lame is that). 2) The elevator was unreliable. After checking in, myself and another guest were stuck on the first floor because of a malfunctioning card-reader in the elevator. The front desk staffperson fortunately was able to jiggle her card in a way that prompted the elevator to start moving. Not a good sign.3) The room reminded me of a depressing college dorm room. 4) The staff have no concept of customer service. On a prior visit, the staff were not willing to make any accomodations for a late checkout (even 15 minutes after the official checkout time - truly Kafkaesque). At checkout, no one has ever asked me whether I enjoyed my stay. Overall, the location is great, the rooms are clean and quiet, and all of the appliances work. But expect to be treated like a third-class citizen if you stay here."
River Hotel,4,Good enough,"We stayed in a small queen room for 2 nights. The room is small, but comfortable. I will say, however, that the bed is on the hard side and not the most comfortable. The sheets have a papery feel to them as well. But the pillows are fluffy. Not the typical hotel bed where you feel like you're sleeping on clouds, but it does the trick, I suppose. Still, all in all, the staff is friendly and the location is really convenient if you'll be spending time downtown. The room is quiet and the wifi is free. It's also affordable. Based on that, I recommend it.Dear Ann C,Thank you for your recommendation! We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback about your recent experience.We look forward to welcoming you back in the future."
River Hotel,4,Excellent and good value for money,"Stayed with my family here and we loved its location and friendly customer services especially from the front desk (Pedro) and cleaning services. I would highly recommend it for business and leisure stay as it is centrally located, proximity to shopping malls, restaurants and the Millennium Park."
River Hotel,4,"Great location, small but comfy rooms","This hotel is a Club Quarters hotel, which means that it is geared towards business travelers. Our room was small, but perfectly adequate since we weren't in Chicago to spend time in our hotel room. The hotel reminded me of a European hotel, especially since it's in an old building. The location is perfect right across the street from the River, near Michigan Ave. between the Magnificent Mile and the Loop. The hotel restaurant is surprisingly good, and makes the famous Chicago deep dish pizza. The couple at the table next to us were staying at the Fairmont and their concierge recommended it."
River Hotel,4,River Hotel Review,"The location is amazing... right on the river and within walking distance to tons of shops and restaurants. I had a great view of the river from the room!Having the water bottle filling stations was a great benefit. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The self checkout was a breeze!Hello Kathleen C,We are happy to hear our location suited you well during your trip. We are lucky to be located right in middle of the city close to everything. We pride ourselves on service and happy to hear we met our goal during your stay. We look forward to seeing you next time in town."
River Hotel,3,"Nice Clean Hotel, Great Location, but Rigid Policies","This hotel is located across the river from the Trump Hotel which makes it walkable to Michigan Ave, Millenium Park and possibly even Navy Pier. Rooms are nice, sleek and clean but SMALL. How often have you stayed at a hotel and asked for a late checkout Has any hotel wanted to charge you for it Well, this hotel charges 35 for late checkout! We had a situation, where my mom, a senior, was traveling with me and was injured the nite of our stay at an outing. We ended up having to go the hospital emergency room and didn't return to our room until 3:00 am. When we woke at 11:00 am, we were hoping they'd allow us a late check out so we'd have time to get some food, especially since she is diabetic. The hotel would make no exception or allowance. We had to hurry and pack. We'd prefer to have eaten and then packed up. Because of this insensitivity I've had to lower the rating of the hotel."
River Hotel,5,Amazing Hotel,"Best price hotel in the city! Great location, walking distances to everything! Staff was professional and friendly. If you needed something, they were on it! Our room was very modern, clean, and beds were comfortable. Very quiet for when you are ready to rest! Classy place."
River Hotel,2,"Overpriced, teeny, tiny rooms","Fantastic location but for 200/night, I would have expected a larger room. My room was smaller than any hotel I've stayed at in NY, London or Hong Kong where rooms are notoriously small. There are many, many better options near the Mag Mile and in River North so look elsewhere."
River Hotel,5,Great Spring Break 2018!!!,"The staff, room, experience in Chicago for being the first time was great. I would do this again in a heart beat with my family or friends. research your plans before anything you do. Thanks for the help trip advisor also other websites."
River Hotel,4,Great Stay!,"I really enjoyed my stay at The River Hotel! It had a great location. Our room overlooked the Chicago River and we were directly across from Trump Tower. Very cool. The hotel was also within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do (Millenium Park, Shedd aquarium, the Field Museum, Magnificent Mile, food, etc.). One of my favorite features of the hotel was the free bottles of water. It was nice to grab a bottle and fill it up before heading out for the day. I will definitely be recommending this hotel to any friends traveling to Chicago!"
River Hotel,4,Gir's weekend,"Stayed overnight on 4/23/16 with my sister at the hotel and was very pleasantly surprised! The hotel's location was great and the interiors were very stylish. My sister and I stayed in a room with a wonderful view of Trump Tower, Marina City, the Chicago's river and bridges. The room itself, although small, was clean and nicely decorated. Our room had twin beds that were firm but comfortable to sleep on. The hotel was perfect for our needs! We wanted a place to stay near the loop where we could make the most of our weekend downtown. Also, the staff was friendly and the customer service manager that assisted us, Pedro, was very helpful. We plan on coming again in the fall for another weekend downtown and will be staying there again.Dear 216jvs,Thank you for your detailed review of the River Hotel. I am so glad you found the room and staff services to your liking and you were able to enjoy your weekend from our ideal location in the heart of the city. Pedro is a great asset to our operation and I will make sure he sees your kind words.We look forward to welcoming you back in the fall!"
River Hotel,5,"Excellent hotel, excellent location!","Comfortable and clean rooms with a friendly staff. The hotel was very quiet - I heard very little noise from other guests. The amenities included complimentary bottled water near the elevators and snacks in the 2nd floor business center. The hotel's location is excellent and right on the river. I would stay there again without hesitation.Hello nchat1,Thank you for the kind words regarding your experience. We work hard to ensure our guests are happy and it clearly paid off! We look forward to having you back with us next time you come to Chicago!"
River Hotel,5,Another wonderful stay,We brought our 6 year old granddaughter to Chicago with us. We have stayed at this hotel at least 6 times and have never been disappointed. The location is perfect for walking to many touristy spots. We even walked to and from union station. Thank you for staying with us recently and for your kind recommendation both are greatly appreciated! We are pleased to hear that you are a great fan of the River Hotel and delighted that your granddaughter had a wonderful stay. We agree -- our prime location in the heart of the city is perfect for experiencing all that Chicago has to offer.We look forward to welcome you back to the River Hotel very soon!
River Hotel,5,Did we just get lucky,"We had a couple of days to spend in Chicago and wanted a hotel close to our car rental and to a train station, this place fit the bill. It's right in the middle of downtown Chicago and within walking distance to pretty much everything. It wasn't too cheap compared to normal hotels but all the other hotels close by were a lot more expensive so it felt like a good deal.It's a very simple lobby with just a couple of people in the reception and you could check in via a touch screen. There was a restaurant right next by but we didn't try it. There's plenty of restaurants and shops everywhere close by anyway.We ordered a room with two beds because of our kid and was expecting two beds close together, but we got a huge room which was pretty much two rooms in one with a hallway in between. It had two TVs and two bathrooms. I don't know if we just got lucky and got the biggest room they had for that price or if they're all like that. It was a great surprise for us and our kid could even play hide and seek with us!"
River Hotel,5,Spectacular view and wonderful Service :),"Upon arriving to our hotel we were greeted warmly by a friendly door man then proceed to check in where a friendly and helpful gentlemen named Tim took care of us at the desk and set us up with a spacious room with a spectacular view. The stay here really helped make our trip to Chicago amazing and very enjoyable. Tim and Devon were more than willing to help us with any questions we had about getting around the city, which was a very nice gesture you don't see often. Thank You to the staff, we will definetly return to see them again the next time we are in town."
River Hotel,2,Some things right... so many things wrong,"The building looks beautiful the lobby too. They upgraded me to a room with 2 bedrooms, 3 tvs and 2 baths! I was ecstatic at first. But more things wrong than I've ever encountered in 1 hotel room: 1. The a/c, even when set to 65, was warmish, and only blowed in the entryway, not in the bed area.2. The light next to the bed was linked to the entry light: if you wanted the bed light to work, you had to have that hall light on. If you turned that off, the bed light went off too.3. No ironing board!4. Nothing to put the soap on, just the bathroom counter. That's icky.5. The bedspread was cool looking, but not something I'd like to sit on or sleep under. But if I peeled that away there was just the sheet. 6. That entryway was dark, even with its one light turned on.7. The counter with the coffee machine was dark too, even with the light turned on.8. Get rid of coffee dispensed in those plastic cup thingies - so bad for the environment!I lost count after that, but you get the idea. All these things could be tweaked and it would be a good place."
River Hotel,3,"Great Location, Tiny Rooms","We were given rooms at this hotel on Hotwire. The location was great and the staff was very helpful and friendly, but our room and bathroom/shower were very small and the bed was hard as a rock. It seems standard these days that 1-bed rooms will be outfitted with a King bed and 2-bed rooms with 2 Queens or at least Doubles. Our room had a Queen bed which took up most of the room and my mom and brother's room had 2 Twins! The TV was extremely tiny compared to any other hotel I've stayed at and my 6'2 husband had a hard time taking in shower in the tiny space. Wouldn't stay here again due to the uncomfortable room."
River Hotel,5,Great Stay! Thanks Virginia!,"Stayed at Club Quarters Downtown in April. I was initially disappointed with the size/layout of my room, so went right back to the front desk to complain (rooms are small but clean and staff is helpful). Virginia, the gal at the desk apologized and instantly moved me to a room with a view of Chicago River. Since it was my first visit to Chicago I asked Virginia about things to do in the area. She inquired about my interests and 10 minutes later I had tickets for Wicked, one of the hottest shows in town, dinner reservations at Vivo, trendy Italian restaurant in the theater district. Next day Virginia suggested a trip to the Art Institute, only a 10 minute walk from the hotel! , walk in Lincoln Park and a very pleasant restaurant for dinner with live jazz . What a great city! I enjoyed my stay tremendously. Will be back, thanks again Virginia!"
River Hotel,5,Just perfect,"Loved this hotel for its service, amenities, location (walking distance to everything), free wine hour, laundry room, the rooms were very clean, perfect size, comfortable bed. I would definitely stay here on my next visit."
River Hotel,5,Wonderful,"The rooms are small but well thought out. They are very cosy and comfortable. It is across from the Trump Towers and the river where you can get on a boat and go for a little cruise, the Big Bus company stops directly across the street from the hotel"
River Hotel,5,small clean room,"The room was small quite clean the staff very helpful. I would stay here again as the location is wonderful, the price is reasonable and room adequate. I don't spend much time in a hotel room so the lack of space was not a problem."
River Hotel,5,Absolutely perfect for my needs,"I was attending a conference at the River Hotel (January 30-31, 2016). This was purely business so I wanted to minimize my stress by staying at (or near) the conference location by being able to fly in, then shuttle to from O'Hare airport and yet have plenty of dining options within walking distance of the hotel. The River Hotel found me a small room for a VERY reasonable (unbelievable) rate. Yes, I have read the reviews about the small rooms. This one was small. There was one queen sized bed, a desk, a pull out work station, and a full (shower) bath. Period. No extras. Yet it met MY needs (listed above) and my usual criteria of CLEAN, COMFORTABLE, and SAFE. The staff was EXCELLENT. I received friendly, efficient 5 star service for a 3 star price - from every single employee shift - both day night. I received free bottled water from a water station in the hallway. The vending machines were reasonable. My 17th floor small room, overlooked the river, the Trump Tower, the River Walk, and the city lights and sounds only added to the ambiance. I took the elevator down, crossed the lobby, took another elevator up to the conference (the two elevators - activated only by your room key card - ensured that the guest rooms were secure from being accessed by non guests). Even the conference was well prepped and attended by the hotel staff with fresh coffee, tea, and complimentary sodas that were refreshed at every break. I could continue... But suffice it to say that I was IMPRESSED. YES. My room was small. However, the break in price was compensation for this and (since I was only needing work space sleep) I did not NEED more. That said, if I am ever in Chicago again - for work or vacation - I WILL be back. NOTE: The hotel has an on site Italian Restaurant called Bella Bacinos. I will review it separately. For now, suffice it to say the food was DELICIOUS, the service was also 5 star, and the price - while not as inexpensive as I am accustomed to - was as affordable (more so) than comparable places nearby. Just be aware that a small is a medium... a medium is a large... etc. Yum!Dear John S,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for your detailed review of your experience.We are so proud of our staff services as well as our prime location and are delighted you were pleased as well. There is nothing I like more than sharing great comments with the team and I will certainly pass along your kind words.We are beyond thrilled to know we are your hotel of choice when visiting Chicago. We will look forward to welcoming you back soon!"
River Hotel,4,Nice Place To Lay Your Head for the pricr,"So if you are going to Chicago to stay in your luxury hotel to be pampered with massages and 5 star room service- this is not your hotel. If you are going to Chicago to shop, sight see, or hit a few wonderful restaurants and want a clean, well maintained hotel where you can sleep peacefully- this is your place. The price is great for what you get. There are few frills, but the accommodations are very reasonable in terms of function and comfort. The perks:- Great location! Close to shopping, parks, restaurants, Navy Pier and most downtown sights.- In and out valet parking for a reasonable Chicago price (52/day). You can find cheaper parking nearby, but not with in and out options.- Complimentary ater bottles and purified water on all floors.-Lounge with complimentary snacks, coffee, tea, and soda open for much of the day.- Wine in the Lobby in the evening.- Responsive, kind staff.-Free high speed internet is high speed enough for most purposes.The less fabulous aspects:-Rooms are small or sparsely decorated. The rooms serve as a clean, functional space. There are no bathtubs, only showers. You get a a couch, TV, mini fridge and desk if you upgrade to a queen suite.-Matrresses are firm...not so firm those of us who prefer softer beds can not sleep, but firm.- Valet was understaffed for our visit with only one attendant even during busier times. It did take 20 minutes to get our car when requested.- The cable is not top quality and goes out or the stream gets paused often."
River Hotel,5,Wonderful hotel!,"The best thing about The River Hotel is the staff! They make you feel extremely welcome and that they cannot do enough to accommodate you. I was particularly impressed with Pedro on the front desk, who was cheerful and obliging, and a great ambassador for the hotel. The location is perfect, and the rooms both comfortable and private. Great value for money. I thoroughly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Chicago.Dear azelinaf2017,Thank you for giving us a perfect rating and for recommending our hotel to other travelers. I'm sure our entire hotel staff enjoyed catering to your needs as much as you enjoyed your stay. Pedro is great and a big part of our team and I will be sure he sees your kind words. Thank you for taking the time to recognize him as you have.Please come see us again!"
River Hotel,5,Great Hotel in a perfect location,"Contemporary rooms in a great old building. Friendly staff, wonderful Italian restaurant right next door. Within short walking distance to so many great Chicago attractions. My new favorite hotel in Chicago!"
River Hotel,4,"Great location, good hotel","Great location (downtown, access to bus and Metro, shops, restaurants), Very good and friendly service, general comfort, I did benefit from a special price offer due to low attendance i guess.A few little things to be improved to me are the waiting time (up or down) at the elevator - one elevator only for the upper floors - Insulation in the room (Air, street noise) could be better too. But overall a good experience."
River Hotel,5,nice hotel for a great price,"We stayed at Club Quarters in December.We were in town for the weekend to see Wicked.Its a very nice hotel in a great location. We were one block off of Michigan Ave and about 5 blocks from the theater district.If you're looking for a high end hotel this is not the hotel for you Yes the rooms are small but how long are you really in your roomThe rooms were clean and thats really most important.When we arrived at 1230pm we were able to check in.We were told we could valet park for 36.00 or for 20.00 we could park for a 24 hour time limit in a parking garage right down the street.We opted for the 20.00 option. MAKE SURE YOU GET A TICKET!!!My husband did not get a ticket at the parking garage and when he inquired about it at the office in the parking garage the girl told him not to worry about it.Well on Sunday morning when he tried to get our car back it was an issue. You have to have a ticket to be able to get your car back. After about 15 minutes the issue was resolved and we got our car back.The entire staff was very helpful including the doorman. He was very helpful in getting us a cab. He ran down at least a block and flagged down a cab, he got in the cab with the driver and came back to the hotel so we could get our cab. It was a very nice thing to do considering the day we were there it was sleeting and raining and everyone in chicago was trying to get a cab at the same time.After reading all the bad reports on his hotel we were debating on switching to a different hotel.We never waited for an elevator, the rooms were clean, the location was great.Im glad we stayed here. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a resonable priced hotel near Michigan Ave."
River Hotel,5,Perfect!,"My experience in this hotel was perfect! Rooms are clean, well-appointed, not so big but privided of all comforts (Tv, coffee machine, bathroom, and free wifi). In each floor, near the lift, you can find a free water dispenser with new bottles and also some chocolates and candys. Every day at 5.00pm, in the lobby is arranged a complementary wine free for the hotel hosts. The hotel is very well mainteined and clean but the strenght point is the position in the city. It is located in the loop (the city center) on the river in front of the Trump tower. It is really close to millenium park and magnificent mile (two of the most touristics place in the city). Moreover the hotel is close (5-7minutes by walk) to the underground line for the O'Hare airport. The staff of the hotel is extremly avaible and ready to meet all you needs. I was in chicago for a business travel so i can't give you informations about costs because i didn't manage the booking of the hotel. Anyway, after my experience, absolutly, I would suggest this hotel for a pleasant and comfortable stay in chicago.Dear Concetta D,Thank you for choosing the River Hotel and for taking the time to provide a detailed review of your experience. We are thrilled to know you found everything to your liking. We really enjoy passing on comments such as yours to our colleagues and thanking them for their great guest service.We sincerely appreciate your recommendation!"
River Hotel,4,Location Location Location,"Great hotel nothing spectacular, the price is right, but the location was awesome. Right in the middle walking distance from everything!!"
River Hotel,4,Great Location,"Stayed for a weekend trip in Chicago. Hotel is in the perfect location in the city centre. Walking distance to Millennium Park. Great room - compl. upgraded was provided to us so we had 2 queen beds and 2 bathrooms so the room was very spaces and was always kept clean. Complimentary water bottles are refill stations on every floor as well as coffee on level 2. Staff is amazing and have great advice on restaurants and places to visit. Only issue with my room was that it looked out towards trump tower - not exactly what you want to wake up to each day.Hello Helen D,Thank you for choosing Chicago River Hotel during your recent travels. We are delighted to hear you enjoyed your complimentary upgrade and enjoyed the extra space. We are very lucky to be right in the middle of the city and within walking distance to all major attractions. We are also glad to hear you found the staff to be amazing as we pride ourselves on our service. We look forward to seeing you again next time you come to Chicago!"
River Hotel,5,"Comfy, clean, great river view, loved it..",Stayed here for one night passing through. We loved it. Room was nice and comfy! Great river view. Just ask for it. It's located in the heart of downtown so traffic is chaotic. Busy town. Parking is expensive. Self park is 24 in the public parking w/ validation around the corner from the hotel. Valid parking is 43. Everything is in walking distance so park the car and just walk. No point in driving. Ever been to Paris Kind of like that.
River Hotel,4,"Cool place, great staff!","My boyfriend and I stayed here based on the reviews on this site, which I can usually depend on--and again, they were right!The hotel is very nice inside, the location is prime, and the staff is one of the Best we have ever encountered, and I have travelled worldwide. The rooms are smaller, but if you think about it, what is missing is the vast expanse between the side of the bed and the main window, and who uses that Anyway!Great things that made up for the smaller size (and my boyfriend is 6'2 and had No problem with the hotel at all!)are the small kitchenette, with coffee maker and supplies for morning java, the bathroom and it's nice shower, and the bed was very comfortable! Ask for a room higher up and enjoy the great view! We were not disturbed by any noises, nor elevator troubles, in the least. There is also a nice desk in the room, for your laptop. Once more, the staff here will do everything in their power to make your stay wonderful!We Will be going back ,and we will be staying at CQ! There is also a small cafe in front of the hotel that had a very good breakfast, and looked busy at night with casual cocktails and Italian food that looked great.Remember that you are not moving in for good, and once you get in the room, you will find you have all the space you need!"
River Hotel,5,"Stylish rooms, excellent staff, excellent location","The rooms are smallish but up-to-date. Very clean and sleek, two of us did not feel cramped. The hotel provides unlimited cold, filtered water and bottles for you to put the water in. They also have coffee, coffee maker, microwave and refrigerator. The views from the river view rooms are spectacular (we were on the 7th floor). Location is central. The staff is friendly and accomodating. The restaurant has a great mushroom with mozarella de bufalo and risotto appetizer. You really cannot ask for a better hotel!"
River Hotel,4,"Great hotel, best value, awesome location","We stayed for two nights when we ran the RNR Half Marathon this past weekend. We were extremely satisfied about our stay. The room was clean, and we had the best view of the river! We cannot be more than happy with Tania at the front desk!! She was awesome, very helpful and accommodating. We will definitely stay here again."
River Hotel,1,Worst hotel ever,"I am 71, have been travelling around the world all my life, and your hotel is the worst experience ever.My room has been booked through Booking.com for one month.I arrived Friday Sep 9th at 2.45 pm. I know that the check-in time is 3pm but no room was available and I had to wait till 3.15 !No luggage rack in this tiny room and I had to call three times before I got one (check the records of the Housekeepers phone)When I came back at 6 pm after having walked in the city, I wanted to take a shower. The water was cold (around 30 degrees Celsius ). The Housekeeper sent someone who was unable to fix that. So I went to the reception desk who gave me another room .The first room was on the 28th floor, the 2nd on the 4th so I had to repack and go from one room to the other 3 times THRU THE LOBBY, because the elevators are not the same . No one would ever propose to give me a hand !I gave two trousers to be washed and ironed. That was done at 8.30 and I was supposed to have them back by 6, that evening. Nothing. I had to claim them the following morning . That doesnt fit with what is written on the laundry service paper.This morning, I ordered black tea with milk in the Coffee Shop downstairs. The waitress brought me tea with bergamote, which is not a tea in which you can put milk. She had to go elsewhere to find the suitable breakfast tea, and I had to claim for sugar which was not on the table."
Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,2,Not yet ready for business travellers,"1. I did not like the experience of dealing with the Expedia person who assisted with the reservation. 2. It was annoying to learn only while checking out that this is a time share hotel. No one told me. 3. The WIFI was slow, and unreliable, cutting out from time to time. Also, when it tried to upgrade to the offered higher speed WIFI, it was quite an ordeal that took about 90 minutes and a call to the help line at your WIFI vendor. BTW, you might try the user interface for that sign up - it exasperatingly erases all one's data entries if a single one of them is incorrect (eg if you generate an unacceptable password) 4. The Business Center has two PCs that are excruciatingly slow, and a printer as well that lumbers along. Old, slow, out of date. 5. The single bright light in this business experience is that the staff were unfailingly polite and did their best to help. I give them credit for trying, and for being nice to me."
Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,5,Nice apartment hotel,We like to have more than just a bedroom. This is a nice timeshare apartment. Near Union Square and Nob Hill.
Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,4,Annoying Traveldesk,"Good location, nice place.... but make sure to avoid the travel desk upon arrival, they only push (hard) to make you attending 2 hour presentation against free breakfast, selling or promoting Whyndham club . Guess the lady at the travel desk get a good commission for each person she signs up for this breakfast meeting, would not let us go unless we signed up on spot after arrival...tired and after a long day travelling it was quite annoying."
Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,5,Relax and enjoy the city,Such a pleasant play to stay and enjoy SF
Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,5,Great place to stay while visiting San Fran,"Excellent location and very comfortable accommodations. Trader Joes was only a couple of blocks away, so it was easy to pick up a few staples for breakfast. This unit had a very efficient use of space for a family of four (two young adults). Plenty of good restaurants within walking distance. Definitely recommend this place, but we never answered the phone because we read the warnings about time share pestering."
Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,4,Quiet and eclean hotel,The hotel property and rooms were very clean. Rooms were very quiet. I would definite recommend this hotel for business travelers and pleasure travelers. The suite set up of the rooms are perfect for families.
Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,2,Wont stay here again and its a shame,"I will never stay here again and its a shame because the facility and location were very nice. I booked and paid in full via Hotels.com. When I arrived and checked in their system messed something up and had a missing day in the middle of our 4 night stay. After waiting at the counter for over 20 minutes while the attendant the manager finally came over and gave us keys and assured it is fine the rate is the same and enjoy the stay. On the way to the room we were greeted by a lady attempting to sell the time shares. The lady was EXTREMELY rude, when we declined the information she made snippy comments like well don't you want to finish checking in. That was her sales tactic but standing there with room keys in my hand and not being born yesterday it was apparent she had nothing to do with us checking in. She also tried to bribe us with chocolate which was very juvenile. During check out and they told me I had a balance. I had to show them the paid in full email and remind them of what I was told when checking in. After going back and forth with the manager she is now going to call Hotels.com to resolve which she should have done in the beginning. The rooms were nice and location was fantastic but its a shame the desk staff doesn't have a clue, I will not be returning to this chain and also will push my friends and family to avoid it as well."
Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,5,Better Than An Ordinary Room!,"We loved our room at Wyndham Canterbury! It included a small kitchenette with a dining table, a sitting area, and a separate bedroom. While there were only two of us, we certainly enjoyed the extra space. This would be a great place for a small family! And it's only a couple blocks to Union Square.Good Morning JudyZ24,We appreciate the time to comment on your stay with us. I was happy to read that you enjoyed your room and the amenities that we provided during your stay. We hope that you will come back to stay with us again soon.Regards,Matthew JonesGeneral ManagerWyndham Canterbury at San Francisco"
Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,4,Nice Value...but,Comfortable Clean If the Internet connection got 10 better It would have sucked!
Wyndham Canterbury at San Francisco,3,Do you want a time share?,"My complaint is that after you check in, they take you over to their concierge desk and proceed to try and sell you on a time share meeting. And hey, if you want to pay for a room and then spend two hours of your time at a time share meeting, more power to you. I don't. And I tried to be polite about it, because I believe in treating people in the service industry as you want to be treated. I understood it was part of her job and politely told her that I wasn't interested. And the first lady seemed cool about it. Then what seemed to be her supervisor came over and offered me free stuff to go to the meeting. I still said no. She proceeded to get really patronizing. By the fifth time I'm saying no, I start to not feel so polite. And when the same woman calls me up the next night in my room to try and pressure me again into going to this meeting, I just had no patience for it. I loved the room. I loved the size and the cleanliness. I hated that they repeatedly badgered me about a stupid time share meeting. I didn't pay for a hotel room to be pressured to buy a time share. If it hadn't been for that, I'd have had no problem being a repeat customer. I don't like being pressured into something I say no to. And now, a month later, I just got a call from the hotel group, again trying to get me to go to a time share meeting. Luckily, the guy was way more understanding and only made me say no once."
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,5,Location Location Location,"This hotel or what they call themselves motel poses an excellent location in the downtown , with fair value you will not find competitive hotel has the same or near value , free parking is a big bonus, Staff are very polite and treat you as family member"
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,5,Best deal in downtown Atlanta,"I stayed at this Motel 6, 311 Courtland St NE, Atlanta, GA, in August last year for a conference my job would not fund. I was totally on my own dime and so needed to economize. What a great deal this place was! The conference hotel was the Hilton literally next door, and those poor schmucks over there were paying over three times what I paid! For the same location! My room at the Motel 6 was clean, the bed was comfortable, the parking was FREE, AND I had a small balcony off my room on the 2nd floor! The staff was nice - what I saw of them. Granted, the staff at Motel 6 is small - there is no room service, no restaurant, and no bar at Motel 6. But they have all that at the Hilton next door and all over downtown Atlanta so Motel 6 doesn't need it!!! I will stay at this Motel 6 every time I have to go to Atlanta from now on. The location is perfect. I felt as safe as anywhere else I have stayed in Atlanta. What a sweet deal!"
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,2,Basic. Basic. Basic.,"This place is as basic an accommodation as you can get in downtown Atlanta while still being suitable. Yes there is free parking but this place is so cheap that they don't even give you free shampoo in the bathroom - just two little bars of facial soap. Place isn't in the greatest area (downtown Atlanta is kind of sketchy at night) but is centrally located. For a healthy restaurant nearby I recommend Metrofresh - it's less than a ten minute drive and totally worth it! Basic cheap motel quality beds, old TVs, frustrating elevator that takes forever to close and absolutely NO FRILLS. Got it for 53/night using a coupon code on the Motel6 website."
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,4,Top tier Motel 6 in a great location,I stay in a lot of Motel 6s and have been satisfied with just about all of them I've tried. This one is a notch above the typical Motel 6. The location is great -- I walked to World of Coca-Cola and some good restaurants -- and the free parking helps make it a real bargain. The place is clean and well maintained and t staff was pleasant and helpful. I walked both day and night and never felt in danger though I did have to deal with a couple of panhandlers. No surprise there.
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,4,Efficient and great value,"Somehow my booking.com reservation have not reached the hotel so had to wait about half an hour while it was submitted again. Room spacious and clean, heater efficient but pretty noisy, noise from corridor is also thereService could be better - at 0130 at night got a phone call from night manager to immediately re-park the car (evening manager allowed the parking at particular slot). It was outrageousWifi was great and coffee available. For very reasonable price and 1 night stay you can't wish for better"
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,4,"Great Location, Great Rooms - JUST NOISY!","I stayed here for AmericasMart was excited about the fresh paint cleanliness of my room. However, between the hours of 2-5 the front desk staff were incredibly noisy EVERY day (I was here for a week). It was very frustrating. It is more expensive for a Motel 6, but again, the location is great."
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,1,Do Yourself a Favor and Stay At Another Hotel!,"I booked my reservation on Motel 6's website. Upon arriving I requested to see my room before checking in. The hotel clerk refused my request and stated that it is the companys policy NOT to allow a person to see a room until after checking in first. (This should have been my first clue to leave.) The hotel clerk stated that after I have checked in that I could inspect the room. Furthermore, the hotel clerk stated that if the room was not satisfactory that I could leave without being charged. Both the room and the building were not satisfactory. It was 90 degrees in Atlanta on my visit and my room as well as the hallway in the building was hot and was not as comfortable as it should have been. The ice machine in the building hallway was in desperate need of repair because it was making an extremely loud humming sound that could be hear all the way down the corridor. The sheets on the bed needed to be changed. The hotel clerk refused to change the sheets and stated that if I wanted them changed that I had to remove the sheets myself. I have never heard of such nonsense. Lastly, the amount of money that the hotel wanted to charge me was 18.00 higher than the amount I was quoted when I made my reservation. Thus, with the bad conditions as well as the bad attitude of the staff, I left Motel 6 the SAME DAY and checked into the Marriott for just 7.00 more than what Motel 6 was charging per night. However, the Marriott gave me a free breakfast each morning compared to Motel 6 only serving coffee.The Motel 6 hotel clerk did not refund me the full amount of the charge to my credit card account. My credit card was charged for one night's stay. I wanted to get out of there so badly that I did not argue with the hotel clerk. I just disputed the charge with my credit card company and received an instant refund. So for the reasons cited above is why I would not recommend this hotel."
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,4,Excellent value for money!,"Me and my partner stayed at the Motel 6 Downtown Atlanta beginning of september 2015. We were visiting Atlanta for a couple days as we were on route to Fort Lauderdale and slept 2 night at the Motel 6.The Motel 6 is excellent value for money! Rooms are clean with a nice bathroom. Our room also had a small balcony where you can relax in the morning and evenings when it is not to hot outside...Check in staff was very polite and check in went very smooth. Also a plus is that you can get free coffee at the reception area every morning from about 7am. That is very easy when you arrive 'jet laged' from Europe and wake up much to early each morning -)Location of the Motel 6 is perfect because you can do all the tourist places like the Coca Cola museum, the Olypic parc etc by foot.They also have a car park at site at no extra cost, so that was also very easy to park our rental car there.Overal the Motel 6 downtown is a basic but very good motel in downtown Atlanta with clean rooms and friendly staff. I will surely stay here again when visiting Atlanta!"
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,1,Consistency is key..had better experiences until today.,"Adrianna was ghetto. Jay was trying to be professional in his t-shirt and jeans, even trying to correct my English. I've stayed at this property several times and was pleasantly satisfied. I simply needed a place to sleep, wash, and change for conferences that keep me out of the room more than in. Unfortunately, this session was horrible. I'm currently on the line with customer service seeking resolution. Again, before this stay I've never had these concerns. (Side note: the rate was higher than I've ever paid this time. I would think they customer service would match). Jay told a lie to the customer service agent and said he gave me time to make arrangements. He said he could lie because I lied on his front desk agent I simply shared how she acted.Mu, Thank you for sharing your concerns. Please know the service issues you describe are an exception to our guest commitment, and as such, we apologize. Our staff aims to provide the highest level of hospitality to our guests through our customer service, but with your experience, we have fallen short and would like to apologize for the service issues you describe. We invite you to contact our Guest Relations at 1-855-787-9864 to record the details of your visit to help us provide a better guest experience in the future."
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,4,Nice central hotel,"Stayed two nights, was greeted by Ben who was very helpful throughout our meetings during our stay, nicest hotel staff we had on our 2 week trip. The room has been refurbished but it's lacking coffee in the room, it's available by the front desk though. Nothing against the hotel (it's next to a Hilton who would have the same issue) but there are a lot of homeless in the area although they generally didn't cause much issue. It was noted the expensive hotels seem to have walkways above the pavements to avoid the riffraff, although I didn't really like the idea of rising above everyone else to be honest. Only a 5 min walk to Marta stations and downtown areas, 10 mins to the Olympic park area."
Motel 6 Atlanta Downtown,4,"Rooms as nice as Hilton, third of the cost. Same location. Missing only nice lobby and toiletries.","The rooms are actually really nice and updated. The common areas are older and outdated, but rooms are surprisingly nice. Motel 6 immediately next door to Hilton and Marriott Marquis, but a third the price.Nice new fridge and microwave in room. My dog was allowed at no extra cost. Room was quiet. Couldn't hear hallway noise. If you don't mind missing the extra common area atmosphere, swimming pool, pricey restaurants, etc and just want a clean safe modern room with all the necessary amenities and free parking, come here. Free parking in downtown Atlanta is unheard of. Gave cleanliness a 4 cuz comforter smelled musty, but everything else was perfect. Overall a 4 cuz of no extras besides the nice room and free parking."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,5,Always a pleasant stay,"Spent the night here with spouse. Check-in was friendly and fast. Free parking if you have a car and free airport shuttle if you fly. Rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. Very comfortable beds with nice linens. Bath amenities in shower are in dispensers. Soap bars at sink. Great shower head! Single-serve coffee maker, hair dryer, free long distance calls... More"
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,5,Last room at the Inn,"I cannot recall the last time I had an issue at a Drury Inn. Well, we did not have one at this location. The room was comfortable, the staff was attentive and helpful, and it was nicely priced more importantly, we got the last available room for the evening. Next, their complimentary breakfast was good, as well as their late afternoon meal from 5 PM 7 PM. Also, you have to have a key card to access their customer parking area. It was a nice feature which prevents people with ill intentions from driving around scoping out the scene."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,4,Free airport parking and a great bed,"I was looking for a place to stay near the airport and park my car for the duration of our trip. Drury Inn was a great place to stay. I parked for free for a week. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept on!Thank you for your stay and kind words. We are happy you enjoyed our stay and fly package. We recently replaced our mattresses during our renovation and have enjoyed very good feedback. I need to try and get one for my house. Thank you for your business and we look forward to serving you in the future! Kind regards,Eric Gray"
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,3,NICE PLACE TO STAY IF AT REDUCED RATE,"Got a king room for special rate. Had late flight in so unable to comment on evening snacks and drinks. Breakfast was good. Room was nice and clean, however, would not stay here if not for the special rate received."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,5,Great service and amenities with excellent value for the charge!,Great hotel and grounds and easy drive from the airport. One of the nicest hotel chains I have stayed in for this price range.
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,4,Great airport hotel,"We spent 1 night here before a flight out of Atlanta.Pros:Super friendly staff. When we checked in the lady in reception was immediately welcoming and happy to answer my questions. Then the guy that shuttled us to the airport the next morning was just as friendly. In fact he got off the bus at the airport to unload our luggage and explained step-by-step how to get to the international terminal. Great staff!Breakfast: awesome! Sausage and eggs were delicious. They had so many choices!Room: huge room with great a/c. Two tvs and plenty of storage space. There was some dried soap on the shower wall that probably should have been cleaned before we checked in, but it's just soap, so no big deal. Also worth noting: I never heard an airplane during the night. I was worried that staying so close to the airport would be loud, but it wasn't at all. Park fly parking area is closed off and well-lit. Hopefully my car is safe. If not I'll edit this review to reflect any issues. Cons:We had an issue with the plumbing in our room. We were only there from 8 pm to 6 am so I can't say whether this was ongoing or resolved, but the toilet didn't flush well. Like it was almost backed up, but it would still flush a little. Also, it would be great if the hotel had a luggage scale. I would definitely stay here again! Con"
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,3,Just okay. Good food and nice staff though.,Its an older hotel and the room was darker and smaller than expected. The breakfast provided was very nice and they made upgrades to the bathroom. Overall basic and okay place to stay just no visual thrills or excitement. Located directly across from the airport so it is super convenient for air travel.
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,1,worst hotel customer service,"Stayed at this hotel with their package deal of renting a room and leaving your car in the parking lot for a price of 159.99 while you fly away. Car was broken into and they refuse to pay for the damages. No responsibility. do not stay here do not trust them.Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, the airport market has had a recent wave of car vandalism. With the help of police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we fortunately have been able to stop these car break-ins. We understand how frustrating this situation is and again would like to extend our apologies. We want you to know that we will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,4,Quiet and clean with good service,We arrived in Atlanta on a Saturday around 9pm for a one night stay during a cross country trip. We had two rooms booked and called ahead a few days prior to specifically request connecting rooms. The front desk clerk was a very nice lady. For some reason the note about connecting rooms wasn't in the reservation. The clerk apologized... More
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,4,Best customer service!,Stopped here for an overnight traveling through Atlanta. The desk clerks at night were excellent. I had a problem turning my TV on - the lady at the desk came to my room to set it up. Sign in the lobby indicates they are going to start renovations soon-which are much needed - hotel was dated.
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,5,Amazing hotel! We always check for Drury Inns when we travel now!,"We stayed for one night while passing through on the way to Florida. What a great experience! The staff was so friendly and welcoming, the rooms are comfortable, beautiful and clean. My daughter loved the pool, and it was kept up nicely. Not having to leave for dinner or breakfast was a huge plus. All the guests we met while there had smiles on their faces, I'm sure it was because of the great atmosphere Drury staff created."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,4,Just what was needed,"My Dad and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Atlanta for the Chick Fil-A kickoff game between Louisville and Auburn. It was good value for money, with a spacious and comfortable room that was in great shape. The bathroom was spotless and seemed new. Even on the fifth floor, the noise from breakfast diners begins at 7:00 AM... More"
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,3,Marginal,"Im not sure if Ill be other reviewers are used to sleeping in tents, because I dont understand why it would be so great about this place. It has a feeling of age about it, like it was built 30 years ago and trying to look modern but failing.While Ive stayed in the worse hotel rooms, theres certainly nothing distinctive for attractive about this place. Frankly, my wife and I were thinking that we wouldve been better off just trying to sleep at the airport terminal then spend the night here.Thank you for taking the time to provide us feedback about your stay! I am sorry that you were not impressed with our facilities. We just had our exterior renovated in April 2018 and we look forward to getting an interior refresh soon. We like to think that so many of our guests give us great reviews because of our exemplary service. If your travels ever bring you to Atlanta again, we would love to have you back as our guest.Warm Regards,Justina H.General Manager"
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,4,GOOD EXPERIENCE!!,"My stay at the Drury Inn, Atlanta was most enjoyable. The staff was quite courteous, polite and accomadating. The food was good and the hotel was very clean. I will be recommending to family and friends. I will be seeking out other Drury locations. Job well done.!!!!"
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,4,Definitely recommend,"The rooms were clean and beds extremely comfortable. Hot breakfast and dinner every day....dinner consisted of baked potato, cheddar cheese sause, hot dogs, salad and carrots, celery sticks every night. In addition, each night, there was at least one or more additional items - nachos/chicken tenders/etc. We arrived early in the morning and they were able to give us our room which was extremely nice. Staff was EXCELLENT. Every staff member we came in contact with was extremely helpful and friendly. Shuttle was efficient - ran every half hour.Only negativesThe pool was ok...a little smaller than pictured and chilly but the room was heated and the indoor/outdoor feature was nice. On the sunny days, outside pool was nice. The room had a desk, reclining chair and two dressers. Would have preferred a table with chairs over the 2nd dresser so we could play games in the room. Not a real problem....we just went to the lobby and used the tables there. Biggest complaint was with Travelocity. They were supposed to reserve a double bed room and booked us into a single king. My grandson was coming up for the weekend from his military base so it presented a little bit of a problem for one night. Their comment was they couldn't guarantee the room and we would just have to see if we could talk to the front desk. There were several soccer ball teams here when we checked in so there were no roll-away beds. We made do but it would have been better if they had made the reservation correctly to begin with. Will not book through them again.Overall...excellent experience. Even though there were several high school aged groups who were there during our stay...room was very quiet and no complaints with noise and everything was clean and well stocked."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,5,Not One Negative Thing to Say,"As said in the title, I don't have a single negative thing to say about this hotel. Every member of the staff was as nice as can possibly be, rooms are nice housekeeping does a great job, and the complimentary breakfast AND dinner were delicious. Not to mention the complimentary dinner includes (3) drinks. Great location right by the airport easy in easy out, and there are some great restaurants within walking distance."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,5,highly reccomend Drury,"we have stayed at the drury near the Atlanta airport for the last 3 years. great accomodations, friendly staff, affordable, clean, ample parking, etc. very family friendly. will continue to stay here when I have to go to Atlanta"
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,4,Absolutely would stay again,"After an unexpected overnight delay at the Atlanta airport, I was greeted by friendly staff, a clean room and comfy bed! Would absolutely stay here again! The shuttle service was timely and the driver friendly and helpful!"
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,1,Do not get park and fly!,"The hotel is not bad. Staff is friendly. We have stayed at several times. This year we purchased park and fly package and left our car there while away on vacation. We returned to the hotel to find the vehicle had been broken into. The driver's side window had been shattered and someone tried to rip the door handle off. The hotel did cover the hole. We had to find a vacumn and vacumn the vehicle. Hotel did not offer. Had to drive 5 hours home without window through cold temperatures and some rain. They did call the police department. They came out took pictures etc. hotel apologized and refunded our room for the one night park and fly. Needless to say we will not be staying here again. We appreciate hearing from our guests and thank you for your feedback. We were very disappointed to hear your car was broken into while in our gated parking lot and understand how frustrating this is. Unfortunately, there has been a recent wave of car break-ins around the airport, affecting a number of hotels in the area. In the case of a car break-in, we contact and hand over to the local police department for further investigation. Fortunately with the help of local police and third party security monitoring our parking lot, we have been able to stop the vandalism. We work diligently to create a safe environment for our guests and will continue to work with local police to ensure our hotel, parking lot and city are safe. We offer our sincerest apologies and are glad we had a chance to discuss the situation with you directly. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know and we are happy to be of assistance."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,4,Just what was needed,"My Dad and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Atlanta for the Chick Fil-A kickoff game between Louisville and Auburn. It was good value for money, with a spacious and comfortable room that was in great shape. The bathroom was spotless and seemed new. Even on the fifth floor, the noise from breakfast diners begins at 7:00 AM and is rather loud in rooms near the atrium, so if you want more quiet, request a room further away."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,5,The people are awesome,"The staff are not only well trained, they are well hired. In other words, the people the employees are a match for the Drury brand, as their personalities are what I want to see in a hotel. They are friendly, but not cold and 'all business.' These folks have a big job, as for many they offer the first impression... More"
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,1,The Worst Drury Accommodations Thus Far,"First I want to say we had amazing customer service! They let us check in our bags early, the maid service was great (we tip them, you should too!) the shuttle was on time to the airport and the driver helped us with our bags (tip him too!)However, the heated indoor pool was not on. This is my main reason for choosing Drury, since I have children who love to swim. We were disappointed. The food, another reason we choose Drury, was not edible. There was popcorn made once a day, around 10 am, and there it sat all day. I will stay at Drury again, but not this one!"
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,5,Nice room and great staff!,"Stayed in this hotel last week. The manager and staff were very nice and friendly. The room was clean (even behind stuff), the bed was comfortable, and it was quiet. The hotel offered lots of extras for free such as free hot breakfast, drinks in the evening, hot dinner, and long distance calls. While the food was bland and tastelss, it was there for anyone that did not want to go out for decent tasting food. The bartender poured good drinks and it was a good opportunity to meet some of the other hotel guests and the hotel staff. The manager made it a point to stop at tables and talk to guests and get to know them. All-in-all it was an excellent stay and very good value! The only item that could be considered a complaint was that even with the heat off my room was hot. I had to turn the AC on to get a comfortable temp."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,2,The only time TA ever let me down,"I don't understand how this hotel is getting such good reviews.Let me just say, we couldn't wait to get out of here and preferred to wait hours in the airport to staying in the hotel.I did feel sorry for the check in girl. She was alone and it was very busy, but she was very polite and nice."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,5,Great stay and parking free,"We love Drury Inns and were pleased with our stay in Atlanta. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean, and spacious. Breakfast, though crowded this day, was good and well stocked. One employee was even helping people make waffles. We were also pleased that we could park for up to 7 days for free (subject to available space). We only had to fill out a form, which did clearly state that the hotel is not liable for any damages. That seemed fair enough, and we had no problems with our car while it was parked at the hotel for 3 nights. The location was very convenient to the airport (right off I-85) and the free shuttle service brought us right back to the hotel in minutes."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,1,Cockroach with no assistance,"We stayed July 11, 2005. Room 627. Room was in terrible shape: cigarette burns in the carpet, upholstered chair looked so worn it was dirty. We shut the window curtain only to be faced with a large cockroach. Sixth floor, no less. Called front desk: We're completely booked tonight or I would move you to another room. Maintenance is gone for the day, so I'll try to get up in 10 minutes. 45 minutes later I went downstairs. Two people were at the desk checking in another party. I voiced my complaint and was told they were busy with a customer. I replied that I thought I was a customer too, only to be told: Have a nice night. Last time for us at a Drury."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,4,Great Value,"We evacuated to this hotel ahead of Hurrican Irma from Florida. The staff couldn't have been nicer or friendlier. Decor not much, but decent size room. The 4-star rating is for the staff and extra's. They have nice amenities--indoor/outdoor pool, small fitness room, but very nice and accommodating hot breakfast (free) AND free Happy Hour with 3 drinks each AND hot and cold appetizer buffet, which was enough to eat as dinner. There was nice green, tossed ( fresh) salad, soup, chili, hot dog bar, nacho bar, Italian pasta, chicken fingers, cheese, fruit, and one to two other items I do not remember. What I ate was good--did not try chicken fingers. Thought it was a nice extra for what you would normally pay for a hotel."
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,5,Near the airport,My family and I decided to stay overnight before our departure to Jamaica. We live about 50 miles from the airport so we could have driven to the airport. We decided to take off the stress of getting our teens up early and rushing through morning traffic. The rooms were clean and spacious and cocktail hour was enjoyable. The morning of our departure we had a quick breakfast in the lobby and a shuttle service was arranged to take us to the airport. We made the right decision to stay at the Drury Inn.
Drury Inn & Suites Atlanta Airport,4,Recommend! Staff is very welcoming!!! Will stay here again!,"On a two day layover to see my grandkids I stayed here in one of the King suites. I had originally booked a different cheaper hotel (Country Inn) but when I walked in to check on the rooms I decided to look for something else that also had an indoor pool since the CI suites had no window in the Living area. The space there was also very small. I am so glad that I then found the Drury Inn!! The atmosphere in the hotel was perfect for us. Friendly staff!! Yes the rooms were older but they are well equipped, very large and very comfortable. They are not at all nasty in any way so I do not understand the complaints from others. For the price you just cannot beat this hotel!! Lots of food - breakfast with lots of choices, snack in the afternoon (popcorn and free soda) and a food bar in the evening including FREE drinks. Simple foods but VERY acceptable! WE ALL HAD A FUN TIME HERE. The tween grandids really enjoyed the HEATED POOL. This was also a convenient enough location to make a midday trip to the fabulous Aquarium too. We did have a problem with our neighbor smoking in their room although this is clearly stated on signes throughout the hotel that this is a NON SMOKING HOTEL . Since the vents are connected in the rooms we were smelling the smoke. Both the grandkids are allergic to smoke and it really hurts my sinuses too. The staff moved us to our choice of a new room (not sure why the exhaust vents in hotels are now connected but just saw that in a Hilton I stayed in recently too). I will certainly stay here again on a quick layover to Atlanta. + FREE PARKING and FREE WIFI too!"
Halcyon Hotel,1,Better late than never,"I stayed at this hotel in September 2012 for five nights at the end of my six week honeymoon in North and South America. I know you get what you pay for however, this hotel was a complete dissapointment and a sour end to an amazing holiday. It's on the border of the tenderloin district which is known as the... More"
Comfort Inn,4,nice staff,"Staff replaced key card when we lost the original set. A little tricky to find the hotel, but very clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the continental breakfast buffet was very good. Only con was that the furniture was a little scuffed."
Clarion Inn & Suites,5,Fantastic Hotel,The hotel was close to my family who we were visiting. The staff were outstanding.
Clarion Inn & Suites,3,Fine for a night. Good price and location.,"Good price for location - a Midway airport hotel. At about 3 miles distant, it's about 1 mile farther out than the main 'hotel row' but still close to all the amenities - restauarants, grocery stores, etc.The hotel was showing its age a little but was comfortable, quiet and adequate. No complaints. Nothng to write home about either."
Clarion Inn & Suites,3,"not the best, but reasonable",Front desk was not helpful. Never told me breakfast was free in resturant. I found this out the second night I was there when a different person was at the desk. Dead bolt did not work but someone did fix it.
Clarion Inn & Suites,4,Good place !!,"Just stayed overnight enroute to my daughters college campus . But the room was v clean well stocked , with an attentive room service lady . V comfortable . Neighborhood I was not sure about --was told it was safer to stay in after hours !"
Clarion Inn & Suites,5,Great Location,"Since I was meeting a friend coming in at Midway, and being able to shop at the mall right next door, and eat at an IHOP, also right next door in that mall... Everything to make that weekend easy and fun was close at hand.Plus I had to remind myself where I was when I woke up each morning, because the bed was firm, like my own bed at home, so I was very comfortable."
Clarion Inn & Suites,5,good hotels,The staff was very professional and Helpful I loved the restaurant....and the free shuttle service....And we did tip the driver........a wonderful place to stay for early morning flights out of Midway.
Clarion Inn & Suites,4,One night at the Clarion,"There was no guide in the room (the book that outlines amenities, important locations, area restaurants, etc) and I found the wireless to be quite slow. The bed was very comfortable and the room was very clean. Breakfast was tasty."
Clarion Inn & Suites,5,Awesome experience,Love the stay..got off to a rocky start. .doing renovations on 2nd floor. Major problem...but told staff and the accommodations were fantastic...5th floor suite stay from there... I also stayed an extra 2 days just bc of the staff...would recommend this suite to anyone
Clarion Inn & Suites,5,Terrific,Very nice
Clarion Inn & Suites,3,stinky room,I booked a non smoking and at check in we were told that if there is any smoking in the room it is a $200 charge. As soon as we walked into the room you could smell the smoke from someone prior. I alerted the front desk and was offered to have someone spray the room. what good does that do.
Clarion Inn & Suites,3,Met our expectations,Met our expectations.
Clarion Inn & Suites,5,It is a good value and close to Midway Airport.,"It was a short trip, but made very comfortable by the clean room, free breakfast, large breakfast room and the free shuttle to Midway Airport."
Clarion Inn & Suites,3,Close to Midway airport,Clean room. Housekeeping started cleaning at 6:00 AM.
Clarion Inn & Suites,2,Not very good,"Although the hotel was close to MDW, the hotel was pretty old. The carpet in our room was pretty bad, it was sticky and needed immediate replacement. The furniture had seen better days. I didn't think it was worth the money we paid. The hotel certainly needs TLC in many areas to keep it competitive. They were charging 8.50 for breakfast. They could have included that in the price we paid for the room. That is not a big deal but the carpet is. The noise level was also high as it is right next to the main thoroughfare."
Clarion Inn & Suites,4,Very happy,"Was a nice hotel for the area, not too loud even though on a busy street."
Clarion Inn & Suites,2,Over Priced,Not a 3 star more like 2 star. Small room no fridge or micro. Old style room.
Clarion Inn & Suites,5,Clarion experience,"Check-in was a breeze, room was great and we loved the pillows. Close to the aiport and a good rate per night."
Clarion Inn & Suites,5,Excellent for CTA Orange Line Midway location.,"WiFi was not any good. Everything else, was enough for the price."
Clarion Inn & Suites,3,Decent hotel near Chicago Midway,This is a basic hotel near the airport. It is not fancy but is not dirty or run down.
Clarion Inn & Suites,4,Clarion Hotel,"Good location - close to shopping and airport. Comfortable and clean enough, but does need renovation. Good value for the price."
Clarion Inn & Suites,5,It was very close to the airport,It was very easy to reach the airport with free transportation and a on site restaurant to get a quick meal early in the am.i
Clarion Inn & Suites,4,Convenient choice by Midway Airport,"Close to Midway airport, great shuttle service, good interiors for the price. Would readily stay again."
Hotel St. Augustine,4.4,Locarion,"Bad: Mattresses too hard, carpet on lobby too old. Good: Locarion"
Hotel St. Augustine,3.75,2 night stopover,"Darkness of room in Daylight Great simple breakfast and location for South Beach, pleasant approachable Host"
Hotel St. Augustine,2.3,The worst customer service I ever had.,Good: The worst customer service I ever had. In life. The front dest worker was very disrespectful unhelpful. He actually was yelling at me I had to call booking .com
Hotel St. Augustine,4.6,I liked the hotel and the area.,"Bad: Breakfast is exactly the same every day and if you spend there 3 or more days you need a little wider choice. Good: The hotel has an excellent location, and is in walking distance from the beach. The staff is kind, the room is fine and clean, the coffee is good, considering the prices this is a good choice. You can find nice restaurants nearby, shops and bars too."
Hotel St. Augustine,4.8,Enjoyed our stay,Good: Wonderful location. Fantastic staff. Beautiful Art Deco building.
Hotel St. Augustine,2.9,Located on a quiet street,Bad: The staff wasn't very friendly and the carpeting in hallway was creepy and looked dirty. Good: Located on a quiet street

Hotel St. Augustine,3.95,Close to the beach.,Bad: Not the most modern. Could stand upgrading. Good: Close to the beach. Quiet
Hotel St. Augustine,5,Don't hesitate. Just go!,Bad: I didn't like the fact that we only stayed for one night. Good: Fabulous boutique hotel. Great location. Lovely complimentary breakfast. Will return.
Hotel St. Augustine,5,James an Mike were great.,Good: James an Mike were great.....they gave me everything I needed an made me feel very comfortable. The lady that served breakfast was very nice also .Very clean....I will stay there again......5 min. walk to the beach w/ a beautiful park on the way.
Hotel St. Augustine,4.15,Art deco gem in South Beach at reasonable rate with awesome steam shower!,Loved the steam shower! Luxurious!
Hotel St. Augustine,5,A great stay for a great price!,Bad: We had a bit of a problem with our keycards but the staff was so friendly and helpful. Good: The staff was very pleasant. The room was very clean and comfortable and the shower was AMAZING! Great location also. Walking distance to Ocean Drive and Collins Avenue. Would definitely stay here again!
Hotel St. Augustine,4.8,a great location to explore South Beach and Miami,"cant think of anything Location, helpful staff, quiet room, good beds, wifi and breakfast."
Hotel St. Augustine,3.75,Great location for South Beach stays,Bad: Breakfast was not enough. Hidden fee for parking. Hidden fee of 20 for taxes not included. Good: Great location. Clean rooms. Great value for money.
Hotel St. Augustine,3.15,Basic hotel at a convenient location.,Bad: The room was run down and would require to be renewed. Breakfast is very basic. There is no lift in the hotel. Good: Location is good. Room was spacious and had a comfortable bed.
Hotel St. Augustine,4.4,Great location and friendly staff,Bad: Room was a little small but cozy. The cleaning maids were very loud and woke me up in the morning. Could be more respectful of people's sleep. Good: Staff was friendly and helpful. Shower had a modern feel and steam feature.
Hotel St. Augustine,2.1,Not an 8.3 rating at all,"Bad: I really do not know how this hotel has an 8.3 rating. Room is not like the pictures. Very noisy cleanning staff. Parking is not included as the listing says. You have to pay additional fees at the hotel. Definetely, not going back. Good: The receptionist was friendly. You can get some coffe in the back."
Hotel St. Augustine,5,Awesome,"The staff was so kind, everywhere was so clean, and good location"
Hotel St. Augustine,4.4,Great little spot in the heart of South Beach.,"Bad: Access to parking challenging. The hint of disinfectant in the lobby is not inviting. Good: Well located, friendly staff, quiet and clean, all at an affordable price. I'd stay again."
Hotel St. Augustine,2.3,Coffee machine available at all the time free.,"Bad: At the arrival, we paid the parking fee in cash (43) and the rest of the amount for two nights stay with a credit card. Checking the transactions during the last couple of days we realized that the parking fee has been charged on the credit card TOO. We asked for an explanation and have not received any answer at all. It's simply unacceptable. The room furniture is old, need a renovation. The space around all windows - both in the room and the shower - and the windows themselves were very dirty. Basically no choice for breakfast - consisted of two types of cereal, boiled eggs, white and whole grain bread. Good: Coffee machine available at all the time free."
Hotel St. Augustine,3.55,Location,Bad: Carpet was dirty and old . Good: Location
Hotel St. Augustine,3.15,Both attitude and cleanliness could be better. Stained carpet and cobwebs.,"Bad: The day shift wouldn't believe me that something was wrong with the room door lock and made me re-key. Then, they sent the cleaning staff to 'open my door for me' only to discover that the electronic key system won't work if the batteries in the lock haven't been replaced. Lastly, I never could figure out how to make the steam shower work, but after the episode with the door I decided it wasn't worth asking. Good: The night shift desk was helpful and once she realized she'd made a mistake, she went about solving the problem as quickly as she could. I was still locked out of my room for 30 to 45 minutes."
Hotel St. Augustine,5,Wonderful time,Bad: Nothing bad. . Good: Great location. Within walking distance to everything we wanted to see.
Hotel St. Augustine,4.4,"Comfortable room, but watch your head.",Bad: The 'bathroom' area was open to the sleeping area. It was a unique design and certainly made the room seem larger. It was just a little odd. Also had to be careful about not hitting my head on the edge of the TV that was mounted on the wall between the sleeping area and the bathroom area. Good: The room was very spacious and the bed was quite comfortable. We were only there for the night but it was a pleasant stay.
Hotel St. Augustine,1.65,Bad experience,Bad: Scam more charge of parking and take from my credit card without telling me . Good: Location
Hotel St. Augustine,3.35,"Enjoyed my stay, but i feel as though i overpaid.","Bad: Advertised amenities came up majorly short. Mini bar is locked and does not have any alcohol. Shower appears to have steaming functionality, but didnt work. Breakfast was bread, cereal and hard boiled eggs. Considering you pay 20+ in resort fees, you'd think they'd put a little more effort into the little things. Good: Room was gorgeous, bed was comfortable, shower was nice, starbucks coffee machine is nice."
Hotel St. Augustine,1.9,Would not stay there again.,"Bad: Pictures were not accurate. The halls were dark and dirty. The floor in the room was not very clean. Did not know that there was not an elevator. Thankfully, we were on the ground floor. The eating area was very crowded. Hard to find seating. Good: Location"
Hotel St. Augustine,4.6,Loved room and staff. Worth money!,Bad: Wish there was ironing and ironing board in room. As well as microwave. They did provide iron and ironing board that I shared with my girlfriend 2 doors down and they let me use their microwave by the bar. So worked out. Good: Loved Javier and rest of the staff. Anything I needed they accommodated.
Hotel St. Augustine,3.75,Nice staff,"Bad: The entrance was dirty and there is no elevator, there should be someone to carry your luggage upstairs.. Many people were either female or elderly who need that kind of support. Good: Nice staff"
Hotel St. Augustine,3.35,We were a bit disappointed for the quality of the hotel.,Bad: Best days of this hotel are far behind and the interior would need a major upgrade. When you enter the Room you first notice a bad smell due to combination of moisture and lack of proper ventilation. The air condition was extreamely noisy. You can also hear all voices from the corridor and other rooms. Good: Good location. There was a comlimentary coffee machine available at the lobby. Good bed.
Hotel St. Augustine,4.15,The perfect Location,Bad: No pool :(. Good: The perfect Location
Hotel St. Augustine,4.4,Nice clean and quiet,"Bad: The only disadvantage is lack of elevator, however it's quite common in Ar Deco hotels. However you could ask for ground floor room. Good: I loved staying there. The hotel located between 4th and 3d streets. It's quiet part of seashore, there was much less noise than at Ocean drive. 5-7 min to the beach. Good wi-fi. Reasoable breakfast with cereals and cookies."
Hotel St. Augustine,1.65,Just skip it,"Bad: Not clean, nothing worked, noisy, old and worn-out. Good: Nothing"
Hotel St. Augustine,3.75,2 night stopover,"Bad: Darkness of room in Daylight. Good: Great simple breakfast and location for South Beach, pleasant approachable Host"
Hotel Royal,4,Beautiful Hotel,"I recently stayed at the beautiful Hotel Royal and it was great! The room was clean, the staff was friendly and the location was fantastic!

Hotel Royal,5,Perfect location for a great price!,"The hotel was a pleasant surprise. Perfectly located in the French Quarter and 1 block from Bourbon Street.

Bay Pointe Inn Restaurant,4,Very nice place to stay,"My wife and I have stayed at the Bay Pointe Inn several times in the past 6 years that we have been married.

Hampton Inn & Suites Newport/Middletown,5,Excellent Stay Dennis was the best!!,"Clean comfortable hotel. Dennis the shuttle driver provided a tour into Newport and back to the hotel that was better than paid tours in Boston and Manhattan we have been on. He was the highlight of our trip. We are frequent visitors to Newport but never knew the history. We learned the different neighborhoods and restaurant choices other than harbor side. Breakfast on his recommendation was great! The free breakfast at Hampton is not why we stay there. The cleanliness and security is the most important feature to us. Someone needs to recognize Dennis for his efforts!! We will be back because of this A1 service.Thank you for taking the time to share your experience at our hotel with the TripAdvisor community. We appreciate your kind words and compliments regarding the cleanliness, comfort and security of our location. I will be certain to share your accolades with Dennis who will be thrilled to receive them. He is a tremendous asset to our team. We look forward to having you as our guests again upon your return to Newport. Again, thank you for your feedback."

Had issues with the Internet connection speed.
Hampton Inn & Suites Newport/Middletown,5,We would definitely come back,"The hotel staff was incredibly friendly. They had coffee and tea available in the lobby throughout the day and the night. The included breakfast was different each day and it was quite tasty for a hotel breakfast. I loved the fresh fruit that was in the lobby at all times and the cookies in the evening. Our room was very clean. The only thing I would recommend is that they scrub the hot tub. Although the hotel is not in Newport, it is a straight drive right into the town."
Hampton Inn & Suites Newport/Middletown,5,Delighted,"I've come to expect an excellent level of comfort at Hilton brand hotels, and this Hampton Inn did not disappoint! Spotlessly clean, with friendly staff, free breakfast and comfortable rooms.

The Westin San Diego Gaslamp Quarter,3,"Good for business, not so much of a getaway","For a weekend getaway this was a bit of a let down.

ARIA Resort Casino,4,Just one year later - just wanted to add,"It's been a year since I was there and reviewed the place. Since then they added some things in the room. Like a main console to not only control your room temp, drapes, lights, etc but you could also order food! Room service or take away. The latter is food from FB outlets in the hotel and you self collect... More"
ARIA Resort Casino,4,Best Resort So Far,"Really enjoyed Aria Resort and Casino. Not too big, not too small. Beautiful rooms, great restaurants and pool. Staff is excellent. Would recommend this venue to my friends and family. The Aria Cafe has the best burgers and loaded tater tots I've ever had."
ARIA Resort Casino,5,Beautiful hotel,"This was our second stay at ARia. We booked during a promotion which was going to give us an upgrade to a strip view. Unfortunately, we were only able to see a little part of the strip, but who could argue, a strip view it was. Check in/ check out was fast, in spite of a moderate long lineup. We... More"

The rooms are very nice although I thought... More
ARIA Resort Casino,5,But do it right,I rarely if ever give a five star and I am not a fan of Vegas. This place was exquisite and the perfect place for a romantic getaway.

ARIA Resort Casino,5,Return to Paradise!,"This resort is worth every one of its five diamonds! Stunning service with kindness, support and upgrades when any question came up. Ex.

ARIA Resort Casino,1,Consistently bad service that left us hungry for some decent hospitality,We had high hopes for the Aria - during our Christmas mini-getaway we chose it over several competing hotels due to its promise of a newer hotel with great service and amenities.

ARIA Resort Casino,5,Great location and nice hotel,"I've been to Vegas about 8 times and I've stayed in a variety of hotels, from the Venetian, Paris, Bellagio, Bally's, Wynn, Caesar's Palace, Hilton, etc. I'd say that Aria is the most modern and sleek hotel.

The pool is also fantastic. I... More
ARIA Resort Casino,5,Hands Down One of the Best Hotels in Vegas,This is our second time to stay at the Aria. My husband and I love this hotel.

Location is excellent."
ARIA Resort Casino,5,I highly recommend The Aria,"I would definitely stay at the Aria again. The Aria needs to hire more more Check-in staff from 5PM - 7PM. We had to wait at least 15 minutes to check-in, I felt like I was at an Airport Ticket Counter"

ARIA Resort Casino,4,TOWER Suites vs SKY Suites,"Meant to book Sky Suites due to great previous experience, mistakenly booked Tower Suites. Complementary pick-up drop-off at Airport makes a huge difference to the overall experience.

ARIA Resort Casino,4,Lots to like........,The pool area is good - plenty of sun (as opposed to too much shade at some other Strip 5 stars). The day club is tantalising (I'm too old) but not so noisy that it spoils the pool vibe for non-clubbers. It can be a bit tricky to get sunbeams though - and too many are reserved for VIPs and...

ARIA Resort Casino,2,What housekeeping,"Check in went smooth and the view of the strip and mountains was nice BUT although the room was large the dark brown walls and decor was reminiscent of a boardroom.

ARIA Resort Casino,5,A Good Night,I was in Las Vegas on a quick business trip recently and really didn't have any idea where to stay.

Very clean and spacious rooms weather a suite or just standard deluxe room. A little on the pricy side but in my opinion worth it,"
ARIA Resort Casino,4,Great Resort but showing some signs of corporate bean counting.,"As a frequent guest at the Aria, our most recent trip was almost as expected. The property in general is outstanding for it's facilities and its location on the strip. The modern decor and high end furnishings definitely make the Aria stand out from other resorts . However, we have began to notice a small degradation of the quality of... More"

ARIA Resort Casino,5,Luxury: Cococure,"Ha! I've always wanted to use that song title for a review. ARIA has given me the opportunity to do so. Now, there were only two issues with my ARIA stay.

I also love how everything in the room can be controlled by one device! The monorail also stops here which is a plus! Overall, it can be pricey, but it's worth it!"
ARIA Resort Casino,4,Weekend getaway,"The hotel was very nice. As compared to several other Casinos on the strip the Aria casino had the least offensive smell of cigarettes.

ARIA Resort Casino,5,Top Notch Property for Poker,"The property is great, and the poker room is the best in Vegas. I've rated the Aria as excellent overall. Since no place is perfect, these comments will address only the imperfections. First, the poker tournament area is in the casino area rather than the poker room proper. It seems to be between two discordant sources of music and in... More"
ARIA Resort Casino,1,A disgrace,"This is a case of another Vegas hotel that thinks that just because this is Vegas it can treat its patrons like cattle.

ARIA Resort Casino,1,150 a day is ridiculous,IF YOU BOOK THERE BE PREPAIRED! YOU NEED AN EXTRA 150 A DAY. In addition to the 35 Resort Fee. And to top it off my room isn't ready.

ARIA Resort Casino,5,Aria awesome as always.,Another pleasant stay at Aria. Ask for a room on a high floor if you want a view. Our rooms were on the 4th floor and all we could see was a/c equipment. Brick oven pizza was delicious and buffet filing.
ARIA Resort Casino,4,"Good place, needs work","I really do love staying at Aria! It's very nice, centrally located on the strip, and the service is great, however the last three times I've been there, there's been one or more issues that I've had to call about.

W Austin,5,Wedding Trip,Very good stay with lots of energy.
W Austin,5,Great party hotel for my bachelor party,"I booked a weekend stay at the W for my bachelor party. I booked the room weeks in advance, but the staff said that my room was unavailable due to maintenance. I pressed for the room I booked and eventually got the room I wanted. On top of that, they included drink tickets. The trip started a little rough but it was great. Hotel is situated in a great place and all the amenities like the pool and bar were fantastic."
W Austin,4,Swanky hotel in the heart of Austin,"We love to stay at W Hotels when we travel. This was a business trip and the stay was pleasant. The room was more than adequate. We were disappointed that there were NO drawers in the furniture in the room, so we had to improvise and stack things on the desk. The room was clean and the staff was pleasant. We would definitely choose this location on our next Austin business trip."
Best Western Plus Heritage Inn Rancho Cucamonga/Ontario,4,Really ok.,"For the price this is a well located hotel with spacious rooms with free coffee and breakfast.

The room was clean and quiet with no... More"
Best Western Plus Heritage Inn Rancho Cucamonga/Ontario,1,Most terrible hotel experience.,"The hotel I stayed is so-called a 3-star hotel, here was no hot water in my room and I couldn't take shower.

Given such a bad situation, they said they... More"
Best Western Plus Heritage Inn Rancho Cucamonga/Ontario,4,Comfort Quiet in Rancho,Very comfortable and plush accommodations at a reasonable price right off Foothills Blvd. Beds were especially comfortable. Breakfast was a little disappointing but varied enough that there was something for everyone
Best Western Plus Heritage Inn Rancho Cucamonga/Ontario,5,Best place ever!,"One of the best hotels I've stayed in - staff is great, location is perfect, and accommodation's/amenities A++ We plan on visiting this hotel again, even if just a weekend getaway. There are restaurants within walking distance, all the stores you would ever need for necessities, but hotel/room is quiet and comfortable."
Hotel Lincoln,4,"Perfect Location, Good Hotel","We staid at this hotel for two nights. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is great! The Lincoln Park Zoo is 5 minutes walk away, there are multiple bars and restaurants in walking distance and even downtown (Millenium Park) is walkable (about 2 hours walk if you walk slowly and look at all the other fun buildings around). The only negative about the hotel would be bathroom. It was clean but old and in need of an upgrade. We would stay here again if we come back to Chicago."
Hotel Lincoln,4,Only needed a bed but got an experience instead,"I 'crashed' here after an event, so I had done no research like I would have for a getaway. The location was perfect, the room small but stylish, the bathroom classic and efficient. Our bed wasn't as soft as I needed, but I got a decent night's sleep. After a very late night, we woke to a view of the Lincoln Park Zoo and Lake Michigan. We walked the neighborhood, enjoying the people, sights, scents, and vibe of Lincoln Park. I had zero expectations when I checked in, and definitely found myself wishing we were staying a few more days. The decor was classic and a bit whimsical. I loved it!"
Hotel Lincoln,4,Great location and stay,Everything was great during our stay except that there was no hot water in the sink.
Hotel Lincoln,5,Hotel Lincoln,"I was lucky to be upgraded to a lovely Jr suite with great views of the lake and park. Unfortunately, I was only in town for 24 hours so I couldn't fully enjoy the hotel."
Hotel Lincoln,4,Hotel Lincoln,Hotel is ok. Rooms could be cleaner and smell better. If you are looking for a cool hipster venue...this is it!
Hotel Lincoln,5,"Great Location, Amazing Staff",From start to finish the staff was super helpful. All staff genuinely seemed happy to work there and help guests. The room was comfortable and spacious (a corner room). The vibe is great hip and fun without the pretentiousness of some hipster places.
Hotel Lincoln,5,Night and day above the other,"I say that because I cancelled my second night stay from an awful hotel downtown and booked my second night at the Hotel Lincoln. Best decision I made the whole trip. The room was great (spacious, clean, well furnished and very modern) and the staff was even better. My wife had a bad stomach ache in the middle of the night and I called down to the front desk and asked if they had any Pepto-Bismol. They said no and started telling me where the nearest Walgreen's was and then stopped and offered to get some money from me and go get it for me since it was the middle of the night. I was super greatful and tried to give him a tip, he wouldn't take it. And that is just one example of how excellent the staff was. Next trip to Chicago I'm staying here again!"
Hotel Lincoln,3,Room was disappointing,"We were disappointed in the room - however, I will say that if you're looking for a small place with a great view and a really nice park directly across the street, this place is perfect. Also, the rooftop bar was great - although a bit pricey. Our disappointment was in the room itself, which was extremely small and not at all comfortable - overall felt like it was way too much money for such an uncomfortable room."
Auburn Travelodge Inn & Suites,4,Good stay,"Decent for the price, my room didn't have a microwave. I inquired about that at checkout, and was told to make sure to ask when I make my reservation. This stay I was on the end of the building away from the railroad tracks, thus giving more restful sleep. Overall good stay."
Biddeford Motel,1,"PLEASE,AVOID THIS PLACE","Horrible smelly roomsasked for our money back ,since we could not have stayed in this place with my daughter having difficulties breathing in that smell.They told us they will refund-well,the money was never returned to my account.Even when asked a several times.Rude staff."
Best Western Granbury Inn Suites,1,Could not have been treated more poorly,"Counter staff tried to be helpful, however my problem needed the manager's attention.

Omni Royal Orleans,5,Wedding,"I stayed in the Pontchartrain Suite so that my daughter her 9 bridesmaids could get ready. It could not have been any better! It was spacious enough for everyone, plus the hair make-up crew, as well as friends stopping by. I'd highly recommend it!"
Omni Royal Orleans,5,Very nice hotel,"While you can always look hard enough to find something wrong with a hotel, the Omni for our two nights there was excellent.

Omni Royal Orleans,4,Birthday celebrations start at the Omni Royal,"After a very long day travelling, 2 flights, 14 hrs total. Transfer taxi, no show, finally arrived at the Omni Royal.

Especially, as I had contacted the Hotel... More"
Omni Royal Orleans,1,Do not stay here,Our upgraded balcony room over looked the dumpster. The housekeeping service was VERY POOR. The hotel billed for Wi Fi service that was not used. Towels were never replaced and we had to call for soap.
Omni Royal Orleans,4,Centrally located and classic,"This is an older hotel in the French Quarter. Centrally located with all the typical amenities youd look for in luxury lodging (gym, pool, rooftop, in-room dining, restaurant/bar in the hotel room). We didnt use the gym or the pool, but we did order room service and eat at the restaurant (Rib Room). For my taste and money, I like... More"
Omni Royal Orleans,4,Great place to stay.,Outstanding location. Hotel is beautiful and well-kept. Staff very friendly and helpful. Great food. The pool and pool bar are rooftop and offer a panoramic view of the city and river. Very relaxing. Also very relaxing is having a drink and enjoying the pianist in the afternoon. I enjoy the breakfast brunch.

Omni Royal Orleans,4,Well worth the cost!,I have stayed many times at this hotel over the past 20+ years and prefer it to the others I have tried in New Orleans. I have also recommended it to friends and colleagues who were very pleased. It is somewhat pricey but you will not be disappointed.
Omni Royal Orleans,4,Good Experience- TINY Rooms,"Loved the location, service and staff. The rooms were EXTREMELY small. We upgraded to a Deluxe Queen room and was surprised by how tiny that room was. We could not imagine the petite rooms.

Omni Royal Orleans,5,Great Pool and Views!,"This hotel was Amazing! Though it's not as hip as the W Hotel, The location is amazing - right across the street from K-Pauls and Nola's - two great restaurants. Also, the pool is probably the best of any hotel pool and you really have to have the pool when it's around 90 degrees in the spring and summer. I highly recommend this hotel!"
Omni Royal Orleans,5,Excellent Hotel in French Quarter,I have stayed many times over the past several years at this classic hotel.

Omni Royal Orleans,5,A respite from the bustle of Bourbon Street,"We spent two relaxing nights at the Omni. Wonderful room, helpful staff.

Omni Royal Orleans,5,The hotel is impeccable in every way,"I would like to say thank you to all the staff, for our stay at the Omni. We were very much surprised when we got to the hotel.

Omni Royal Orleans,4,Naomi,Pets are allowed. You do not know which rooms they allow Pets. I was awakened my first evening four times by two pit bulls barking beside me. Staff moved us to different room next day. Valet parking is too expensive. Rib Room prices are also too high. Rooms with a balcony are the way to go. Good Location for Hotel.
Omni Royal Orleans,5,Perfect location,The room was very clean and you can't beat the location. The Riviera bar and pool on the roof is a nice amenity to have so you can relax for a few hours before the night life. You are walking minutes from whatever you want to do in the French Quarter.
Omni Royal Orleans,5,Wonderful Hotel with the Perfect Location!,My husband and I just returned from a 3 night stay. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and it was our first time visiting NOLA. Since it was our first time visiting and we were celebrating a special occasion we booked a king suite with a balcony. The extra price tag was worth it. The balcony was amazing- we overlooked...

Omni Royal Orleans,5,This is the place to stay.....stop searching!!,"The location, staff and hotel are fabulous! The hotel was full but I would've never known. It was quiet in the hallways. Everything is right on point. I travel a lot and this is my new favorite spot in NOLA!"
Omni Royal Orleans,4,Enjoyed My Stay,"Found the hotel to be conveniently located and tastefully decorated. Service was polite and prompt. My room was great: clean comfortable and again, tastefully decorated without looking suburban-generic. Try to get a balcony room if you can. It's so nice to be able to open the French doors and let the sounds of New Orleans into your room! Loved the rooftop pool, we were lucky enough not to have had too many children to deal with. I would definitely stay here again."
Omni Royal Orleans,5,"Perfect stay, except for cigarette smoking issues","Love the OMNI for many reasons, the only thing that is a huge disappointment each visit is the cigarette smoking being done in the outdoor areas that we are supposed to be able to enjoy fresh air (the pool, balconies, front door entrance). Rules need to be enforced, rude guests get mad if approached about taking smoking to appropriate areas."
Omni Royal Orleans,5,Walk ANYWHERE in the French Quarter from this Historic Hotel,"Omni Royal Orleans offered convenient location, and loads of amenities. The staff is gracious and really makes you feel at home from the second you arrive outside the front entrance. There is a restaurant downstairs where we had an excellent meal, and the lobby bar was fun and relaxing for cocktails. For American standards, the room is small. If you... More"
Omni Royal Orleans,4,Great location!,Cant beat the location of this hotel. Its a block away from Bourbon street and minutes away from Jackson Square and other attractions. Plenty of restaurants near by. Staff was extremely pleasant. The rooms were nice and clean. No complaints overall. Booked the hotel through a package deal and got a great deal.
Omni Royal Orleans,5,Fun In New Orleans,"Very friendly, great location in the French Quarter very comfortable. It was just down the sidewalk from Bourbon street but far enough to get away from the late night partying. I give it a 5 star rating."
Omni Royal Orleans,5,One of the best stays I've ever had!,"The room was very clean and beds were extremely comfortable. The hotel staff were so very nice. The location of this hotel is perfect, right in the midst of downtown but not so loud that one cannot rest. We had the best time and this hotel, by far, is one of my favorites. We love the City of New Orleans... More"
Omni Royal Orleans,5,Great Value in NOLA,"This was my first visit to NOLA and chose the Omni on a friends recommendation - was very pleased. Location is excellent, good service and friendly employees. Rooms are small (we upgraded to a deluxe room/queen (still small) but clean, comfy and great water pressure in the shower :). Bar lounge nice (singer Yadonna was very enjoyable). Good Rooftop... More"
Omni Royal Orleans,5,Met all of our expectations....and a lot more!!!,We basically picked this hotel off the internet by the nice picture. What a pleasant treat it was right from beginning to end! I cannot say enough about every aspect of this property and I will be staying there for certain on my next trip to New Orleans!
Omni Royal Orleans,5,You won't find better in the French Quarter,"Lovely hotel, great pool, decent gym, good food, lovely courteous staff, perfect location. You really won't find better in the French Quarter. Only slight criticism is the rooms could be bigger. But they are very clean and well maintained with one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in. Wifi is free if you are staying there - just ask... More"
Omni Royal Orleans,5,Wedding Weekend,"Had our daughters wedding at the Omni Royal Orleans. All the staff was beyond fantastic. Everyone had a great time, the location of the property could not have been better. The quality of the hotel is great. We had a suite and it was perfect."
Omni Royal Orleans,4,Good for pleasure but not business,Pleasurable stay other than terrible internet service. Place was clean and in a very good location. Transportation was easily available. Rooms were quiet and special rooms in the hotel were easily accessible. A nice touch was a filled ice bucket when the bed was turned for the night.
Omni Royal Orleans,5,Awesome Anniversary,"My husband and I visited NOLA to celebrate our first wedding anniversary this past weekend. Upon our late arrival, we were greeted by the Valet and Bell Boy and quickly checked in for our stay. There was a mix up with the room key which stalled our 'settling' for 30 minutes, but we were told that the woman that assigned us the keys was on medication from a dental operation. The room was lush but small - neither of us minded, since we would be tourist hopping and eating all day any...view moreway. The view was great, and we were pleased that it was located far enough from Bourbon that you couldn't hear the crazy screaming drunkenness (though, Saturday was a bit louder than Friday). Room service was excellent and speedy. Information was readily available and the hotel was really clean. We didn't get to explore the upper deck pool area or dine at the Rib Room, but plan on staying here again - it's in the middle of everything and a really great value!view less"
Omni Royal Orleans,5,"Service, location fabulous","Stayed 3 nights for a conference. The rooms are small as this is a historic property, but very nicely decorated, clean and comfortable. There are dimmers on the lamps, robes and nice sheets. Outlets on side of bedside table. Lovely roof Pool and bar. Service was fabulous from fast check in to housekeeping to wake up calls."
Omni Royal Orleans,5,Excellent!!,We arrived early and we hadn't slept. Our room wasn't ready. They finally gave us a room just to sleep in until our room was ready. Thank You!!!! Staff was friendly. Pool was clean and had a nice view with a breeze. Will definitely be back!! I've stayed in many hotels in New Orleans. This one is my favorite.
Omni Royal Orleans,4,Old town New Orleans,"Stayed at this property while on a convention. Hotel is on an old building but nicely renovated. Noise is a problem, though bring ear plugs or ask for a room that doesn't face the street side, as the party goes on all night."
Omni Royal Orleans,1,Zero Stars. Awful Start to New Orleans trip,"Finally Made a reservation with Omni after many attempts. Their reservation system would put call on hold for a long time.

Requested early check in This was a special... More"

Hilton Garden Inn Williamsburg,4.6,Nice room,"Bad: Would have enjoyed a restaurant in the hotel with a bar. One additional chair in the bedroom would have been great. Good: Clean room, comfortable beds, nice location and a friendly staff."
Hilton Garden Inn Williamsburg,3.75,Not Worth the Cost,"Bad: We felt that the hotel was overpriced for the amount we paid. Neither my wife nor I felt that it was worth 265 a night. We make it a point to stay at Hilton properties whenever possible, and this was our first visit to a Hilton Garden Inn it will probably be our last. While the property was nice, it was not what I expected for the price. We get a better value from Hampton Inns. Good: Our room was well appointed and comfortable. As I have come to expect from Hilton properties overall, the hotel was nice."
Hilton Garden Inn Williamsburg,4.15,Good offer for the price!,Bad: Outside the center and hard to reach without car! Internet usage requires registration with many personal details. Good: Good offer for the price!
Hilton Garden Inn Williamsburg,3.35,"Some good, some bad.","Bad: The television was so small that it could barely be seen from the bed. The fitness room was way below par, only two working machines. And, the HVAC in the room was balky, loud, clunky and less than adequate. Good: Location for me was excellent. Breakfast was a real value and the size of the room was really large."
Hilton Garden Inn Williamsburg,4.6,Lavatory very small for a large bathroom.,Bad: Lavatory very small for a large bathroom.
Hilton Garden Inn Williamsburg,4.15,Bed very comfy!,"Bad: Shower liner needs replacing. Upgrade of toilet tissue. Also, would be very nice to have Alittle something to pick up an eat, in the morning, in the lobby area. Good: Bed very comfy! Coffee in room Loved the delicious cookies you had in the lobby area, along with the wonderful fruited water!!!!! Our favorite!!!! That was just perfect in the late afternoon after coming back from Williamsburg!!"
Hilton Garden Inn Williamsburg,3.35,Clean convenient location,"Bad: Front desk guy was grumpy at check in. Breakfast was very confusing, half buffet half waited on. Good: Clean convenient location"
Hilton Garden Inn Williamsburg,5,Quiet respite spot in a busy part of town!,"Bad: Short on hot water during the evening. It was fine during the morning hours. When I mentioned this at the desk they promised to look into it and adjusted my bill to compensate. Good: Very clean, attractive. Good value for the money."
Hilton Garden Inn Williamsburg,5,"excellent hotel in great position, very friendly efficient...","Good: excellent hotel in great position, very friendly efficient staff, great on site cooked breakfast, very good dinner menu and excellent evening bar. Well positioned for many restaurants in walking distance. Onsite pool and gym"

The Bertram Inn & Conference Center,2,Bad Corporate Meeting Place,"We hosted corporate meetings here for 15-20 people for about a week and in short, i will never go back again. The rooms were fine, but the meetings were not the best and the food at the restaurant was very slow and closed early. We had working lunch catered and some of the sandwiches were moldy and service terrible when... More"
Econo Lodge,3,It's a decent place as a very good rate.,"I would recommend the property and would happily stay there again,. I think the room was fairly clean, even though because of the decor and color scheme, at first impression, it gave the appearance that it wasn't.

Econo Lodge,3,Decent Stay,"A no frills location in a residential area. Close to freeways, 7/11, Starbucks and a Mexican restaurant/nightclub. Check in was quick and not welcoming but to the point.

Flamingo Inn Rosemead,4,Outstanding service,"We were just there for the 2012 Rose Bowl. The staff was extremely helpful in assisting us as to how to get around town. They went out of their way to see that we were helped. It's not the Grand Hyatt by any means, but it was clean and quiet. Rick's Burgers across the street had great meals for a... More"
Travelodge-lax South,3,Was Good not Great,My only issue is that I have expierienced better Wyndham hotels for cheaper prices in my area. Bigger rooms to bigger in-room jacuzzi units to better overall atmosphere to the room. Service or cleanliness was not lacking here just overall quality of rooms compared to other Wyndham hotels.
Travelodge-lax South,5,Traveling,When going places I like to see a landing point of a nice place of class. Clean rooms with a decent size to go along with it is a prayer.
Travelodge-lax South,2,Dirty carpet and noisy,Carpet so dirty that upon entering shower the foot prints would not rinse off the tub. Laundry room directly below room would shake entire room when maids were doing laundry.
Travelodge-lax South,1,Definitely Not Worth the Money,"Not enough pillow, dingy shower curtains, bad TV reception. TV mounted in location that it hard to view television. Room almost 100.00 dollars, not worth it, will never stay there again."
Travelodge-lax South,1,Rude staff,General manager was rude at checkin and would not let me checkin for an hour. I had pre arranged to have room prepaid and he refused
Travelodge-lax South,5,Really Nice,"Really nice hotel in an awesome area of Cali. Love this city, A LOT!!"
Travelodge-lax South,3,Good for just passing through,The motel is close to highway I-405 and very close to LAX airport. The surrounding can be very noisy. We stayed one night in the motel because we had an early flight from LAX. It's good for just one night.

Cloverleaf Residence Suites,4,Smells Like Bacon,"I got a great deal on this place on Hotels.com for 81/night. Otherwise, I wouldn't have chanced it.

The Gables Inn Sausalito,4,Wonderful place to stay,"We wanted to stay away from the city in a smaller place, so we ended up in Sausalito. Friendly welcome.

Ocean Suites,5,All We Lacked Was Sunshine,"The property is very attractive inside and out.

The Saga Motor Hotel,3,"Good location, but lacking in updates","The three best things about the Saga Motor Hotel: location, location, location. Right on Colorado Boulevard, across the street from Pasadena City College, the Saga can best be described as a 1950s motor lodge. That is, its a place you can sleep in relative comfort, but the decor is sadly in need of updating. The TripAdvisor photo taken in 2011... More"
La Cuesta Inn,5,Nice SLO hotel,Nice hotel in SLO. staff was friendly and they had cookies and coffee when we checked in. Only minor complaint was the continental breakfast was a little on the light side. But there are plenty of places to eat in SLO so other than that it was great.
La Cuesta Inn,3,La Cuesta vs. La Costly,"The Positives: Most of the staff was very friendly. Good location. Hotel clean. Beds comfortable. The Negatives: Too expensive for what you get.

Inn At San Luis Obispo,5,Great staff and room.,The staff was very friendly and they made check-in super fast.

We will definitely be staying here again in the future.
La Cuesta Inn,3,Just O.K.,"Located very close to SLO Performing Arts Center which was very convenient. Room was clean and appointments were ok.

Hyatt Regency-valencia,1,Wish I could give them negative stars!!!,"My family found our way to Hyatt Valencia as a result of a catastrophic Gas Well blow-out.

Hyatt Regency-valencia,5,Our First Time,"This Hyatt is a great place. Clean, quiet, friendly staff, nice bar, great happy hour, well located and responsive to your needs. We will stay here again without a doubt. It was a little noisy from other patrons slamming fire doors. That was not the hotel's fault. That came from people with no social graces."
Hyatt Regency-valencia,4,We always stay at the Hyatt when we go to Valencia,"This hotel has all the amenities we wanted. The bar is wonderful. The food in Vines, the restaurant, is exceptional. We have enjoyed the wait staff tremendously every time we dine there. The location of the hotel is in a very nice area with many restaurants. For families, it is close to Magic Mountain."
Hyatt Regency-valencia,5,Wknd 4 2,"We were looking for a quick low key weekend escape to get out of the heat, without breaking the bank, Upon arrival, staff was friendly, check in was a breeze, the hotel and grounds were excellent. Location was close to dining, shopping and nightlife. Will definitely return!"
Hyatt Regency-valencia,4,One of the men in Valet was loud and obnoxious! T,One of the girls at check-in had zero personality. actually she was draining. Outside my view room was the obstruction of a white wood gazebo. I don't understand this to be a view. The room service selection price and quality was excellent!
Hyatt Regency-valencia,1,Very disappointed,"There was a restaurant charge on my invoice for 139.00 and I contacted the front desk to notify them that I did not eat at their restaurant, charge a meal to my room or order room service so obviously someone used by credit card info on file to charge a meal. The person working the front desk was dismissive and rude and just said We'll look it to it. I told him that was not good enough I wanted to know if my charge info and identity was compromised so I could notify my bank. I'll cut to chase he was no help. I asked to speak to a manage but I was told there was not manager on duty so two hours later I finally spoke to a manager Jim who told me the charges would be reversed in 3 days...I still don't know if my personal info has been compromised and I have to monitor my account everyday and the charges have still not been reversed. Terrible customer service. Bob"
Hyatt Regency-valencia,3,Decent But Unexceptional,"The Hyatt Valencia, located near Magic Mountain in non-descript Santa Clarita is a dressed up basic hotel. Adding lots of marble flooring and mildly hip decor cannot disguise some neglect and oversights that lower end chains now provide. The ice machine was out on at least two floors the night I was there, and there are no electrical outlets near... More"
Hyatt Regency-valencia,4,Great Hotel,Centrally located centrally located close to centres. Great place to crash after a long flight from Melbourne. Room is well serviced and clean staff very friendly. Nice grounds with swimming pool. However only complaint is the balcony suit with pool views has no views
Motel 6,3,Isn't the best but does have a good bed.,So this isn't the best motel out there but the price is right and if you are just looking for a place to crash for a night it will do. The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. You can bring your pets in the room with you. It's close to the freeway and Marie Callendars (which has wonderful breakfasts). Try it out you won't be disappointed.
Nites Inn,2,Nites Inn,"First of all, the owner manager both are very rude. The room I stayed in was not that clean when I first checked in. There was and probably still is writing on the walls.

Pacific Shores Inn,3,Pleasantly Surprised,"Hesitant to book after reading reviews but turned out good. Staff very nice. Room clean and spacious. Bed was comfortable with clean sheets. Don't know why people complained about the continental breakfast. They had cereal, waffles, muffins, good coffee, juice, etc. in a clean environment. The complainers need to realize this is not a bed breakfast or a gourmet restaurant. Had a first floor room and could hear upstairs foot falls but that is to be expected in any motel. Good thing no noisy people tho. Second night rate (Saturday) was way overpriced for this place. Would recommend if only staying a few days. This motel is just a plain vanilla."
Pacific Shores Inn,3,Would stay again if improved.,"I always take cleaning wipes,side of table,remote control and door handles dirty,lamp shades torn,no sprinkler system not in mine or my daughter's room. Manager very nice,breakfest good,the waffles were a nice surprise,arrears very quite."

Pacific Shores Inn,1,"Close to beach, but old and dirty","Sink had leak, which soaked the entire counter top. Given rags to wrap around the faucet and told that no maintenance person available. Given option to move on last night there. Outlets do not work, plugs fall out. Coffee pot never cleaned out. Towels received were stained. On first arrival, toilet had some poop floating in it. Phone did not work, no dial tone, no way to contact front desk. Went to continental breakfast, and muffins were covered with ants. She put them away, but next morning, the muffins served were stale. I believe she saved them and served them the next day."
Pacific Shores Inn,4,Great Stay,"We arrived late (after 9pm), so we called ahead to let them know. This was no problem and the front desk woman was very courteous. Our room was spacious and included a refrigerator and microwave. The accommodations were clean and comfortable. We felt the hotel was a good value for the price."
Pacific Shores Inn,5,"Simple, cozy and convenient","Good location, walking distance to shops and restaurants. Just a few minutes from the beach."
Pacific Shores Inn,4,Won't stay there again,WiFi was bad spent four days there and got on WiFi 2 times . Water pressure was low. And no decaffeinated coffee. Coffee pot only makes 2 tiny cups of coffee anyway.

I cannot... More"
Ramada-kingman,4,Very nice hotel at affordable price,"The Ramada hotel is located in Kingman, in Arizona. I might be wrong, but Kingman does not have much to offer to tourist.

Luckily, half of... More"

If your looking for a clean, comfortable, reasonably priced room with a comfortable bed. Here's the place. Great location to restaurants for any type you could want. Little hard to find because it's behind a convience store and a Dairy Queen."
Travelodge-beckley,3,Summit Bechtel Trip guide,"We use this hotel for our overnight on the way to and from the Summit Bechtel Reserve. This is a low price place that is close to SBR.

Plantation Inn & Suites,1,The noisiest hotel I never slept in,Unfortunately this hotel had no sound barriers between floors. Noise from upstairs was constant and I did not sleep at all. Bathroom shower surround was damaged and doors were dirty. The best positive was that the room was clean and updated.
Roscoe Motor Inn,2,First Impression - Panic,"When I first saw this motor inn, I thought there was now way I was staying at this place even though I had made reservations in advance.

My only suggestion is that they please stock some plain black tea (only flavored teas were available). All staff we encountered were very friendly and welcoming."
Hampton Inn-elkhorn,1,Good luck if there is a concert in town,"The people at the front desk are rude and not helpful. If there is a concert the weekend you are looking to book, they just hang up on you. What do they care, the hotel is already booked. Low class service."
Hampton Inn-elkhorn,4,Nice quiet hotel,"This hotel was easy to get to and only 8 miles from Lake Geneva, WI. The hotel was clean and the service was excellent. It was in a nice area of town with local business stores within a block of the hotel. The only drawback was no fridge in room."

We arrived shortly after 5:00 pm and checked in to our room. The owner was quite pleasant and answer questions concerning dining and the weather which was very helpful. There was a small fridge and a microwave in the... More
Alpine Motel,4,"Great value, beautiful view, bed was average.","Great value and view with this vintage style motel. Rooms are very large with updated bathroom area, fridge, and microwave. Free wifi and ice. We had two double beds in the room. The mattress on one was very old and sagging on one side. The other bed was fine. Would stay again but ask for a room with newer mattresses."
Historic Hotel Bethlehem,4,Good but not great,This hotel is located in the center of the historic district and is a short drive from wine/farm country. The staff is extremely nice but lacks the polish of staff at comparable hotels in larger cities.
Avalon Hotel & Conference Center,3,No air conditioning. Doubled charged for the room,The room was nice and renovated . I tried to adjust the air upon arriving in a room which was 85 degrees. When we can back it was still the same and when we asked the desk they said the heat was still on and brought us a fan offered to give 10 off.We also paid for the room... More
Avalon Hotel & Conference Center,2,Don't waste your money,We had a king suite with sleeper sofa for three adults. We arrived at about 1'0:30 pm tired from our trip only to find out there were no sheets or pillows for the sleeper sofa. It took two trips to the desk to get what we needed. Then we discovered that the sleeper sofa was hard as concrete. Folded it... More
Avalon Hotel & Conference Center,4,receiption,"the hall was very nice, food was great and the staff was the best. however, they didn't do a couple of thing right that I specifically asked for and I had to a few times during the night remind them of a couple of things."
Avalon Hotel & Conference Center,5,Excellent Value,This hotel is a splendid option for anyone who is to leave on a bus from the downtown area and looking for an inexpensive way to spend their last night in the city. They even offer a free YMCA pass if you want to use the facilities across the street. It was a very comfortable stay and the staff made... More
Avalon Hotel & Conference Center,1,Not happy,Said they upgraded me....I went from a singke king to a double bed room. Not much of an upgrade
Avalon Hotel & Conference Center,2,I wouldn't suggest staying here.,The photos are very misleading. The ceiling in my room and bathroom was falling and bathroom full of mold. I complained but was told there was no other room available. I listened to numerous complaints from other guests while I waited in line to complain. The front desk gentleman was indifferent to the complaints and not much was resolved. I was in town for business and have never stayed in a worse down town 'hotel and conference center' in the hundreds of cities I've traveled to.
Pike Motel,3,Decent for money spent,Wanted a nights sleep and it was non event weekend Asked what time breakfast was Had to make the attendent laugh Got exactly what i expected A parking space A smoking room A bed A bathroom Even a refrigerator Thankyou pike motel !
Best Western Plus Clearfield,2,Fresh oil? stain on pillow,"This hotel looks new and appears to have been newly updated. The breakfast area is very nice and has a homey feeling yet has a very contemporary style. The service at the front desk was speedy and very professional awesome reception with the friendliest staff. The rooms layout is very traditional going back to the older times. Even with some signs of upgrades, it felt to be a very old room. I think the dcor needed to be better and the appliances upgraded. The first thing I spotted entering the room was the throw pillow on the bed with what appears to be a large oil stain (hoping it is oil or grease) in the smack center of the pillow facing right at you. That sight alone made me think that the rooms upkeep was not up to par. I cannot understand why the pillow was even left for display in the room. The bathroom did not have a fan, showering in it created a very steamy room that made the rooms mirrors useless. Water pressure was awesome and the fixtures are all brand new. There was no complimentary bottled water in the room. There is no vending machine in the hotel however, there are candies for sale prominently displayed in the main lobby. The breakfast offered was good and plentiful. As I was getting ready for a biscuit, the lady refilling the biscuit tray rearranged the biscuits with her BARE hands and then with her BARE hands placed new biscuits into the tray. After seeing it, I changed my mind about having the biscuit."
Best Western Plus Clearfield,5,Excellent choice,Clean well-furnished room with good amenities including minifridge and microwave. Fitness room with up-to-date equipment. Nice indoor pool with whirlpool hot tub. I was pleased to see there was a lift to help someone with mobility problems get into/ out of pool. Staff was pleasant and professional.
Best Western Plus Clearfield,5,"Friendly, clean, and comfortable!","I had booked a room via a 3rd party, but arrived late and the only room available was one for people with pets. I couldn't take that spring allergies would have had me sneezing all night in such a room. So the manager graciously gave me a suite at the same price. Nice service!"
Radisson Hotel Valley Forge,5,Business and Pleasure,"This hotel was great! Our company held their meetings there we had catered breakfast, lunch, and dinner by the hotel. At night after our meetings it was great to go to the Casino and the tavern was a cool hangout place."

National Trail Motel,4,Love it or hate it,"The National Trail Motel is not your grandfather's motel. It is your great-grandfather's motor inn or motor court before the word motel was coined.

The 25 inch picture tube television,... More"

Hotel Warner,4,Great location,"My girlfriend and I were stayed one night here and loved the location . All of the shops and restaurants are walkable from this hotel and the staff was great.

Days Inn & Suites Milwaukee Airport,3,Out of control AC and breakfast was a joke.,"The room was very clean, but the AC could not be controlled and we froze at night. I could not turn it off and it ran all night long. I didn't have time to get the staff to fix it, so I just covered the vents with clothes to keep it from blowing out so much. We were still cold. The pool was nice, but the work out center was a joke and only on of three tread mills worked. And there was no weights or anything else. The Breakfast was a joke. There was only cereal and toast and that's it. We didn't even eat it, we just went out on our way to our events."
Days Inn & Suites Milwaukee Airport,1,good but ehh,it was ok I guess looks were deceiving
Days Inn & Suites Milwaukee Airport,1,Horrible,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE

Days Inn & Suites Milwaukee Airport,4,Just a quick relief,"Stay was great and staff was very nice , rooms where clean and had a great smell.

Days Inn & Suites Milwaukee Airport,4,Love this hotel,"I don't really understand why this hotel has such bad ratings. For 60 a night, we got a clean room with a concrete balcony, working television, breakfast, and there is even a pool. FOR 60! The women at the front desk was extremely helpful and kind, and the hotel also works with an extremely reliable taxi service. The only down... More"
Days Inn & Suites Milwaukee Airport,2,Never Again!!,"This was the most reasonably priced hotel. It is understaffed to say the least. Night desk clerk did not charge me for a roll away I needed for 1 night. This is where the good news ends. Each day we had to ask for something that should have been in our room, towels, shampoo etc. Our last night there, we stood in a long line to ask for the cups that were not replaced during housekeeping. I was given the address to Wal-mart to go and buy my own! During breakfast they ran out of spoons, cereal was eaten with a fork. I wish management would train and hire additional employees for better customer service!"
Fairway Inn,3,You get what you pay for,Found coupon at rest stop. 55.00 including tax is reasonable. The property is older with some wear and tear. Rooms are clean but nothing fancy. Old style analog TV. Adequate for a night's stay. Staff friendly and helpful. Easy to find. Close to shopping and restaurants. Right off the interstate.
Fairway Inn,2,Rude 1st shift staff,"Initially a was quite satisfied with this hotel until checkout time, I proceeded to the room containing the continental breakfast which was miniscule to say the least.

Best Western Tomah Hotel,5,I will stay here again!,"Just traveling through and needed a place to sleep. We could not have found a better place. Wonderful staff, what was left. Due to Memorial Weekend they have the housekeeping staff off on that Monday! What a great gesture! Clean, comfortable bed, nice pool and connected to Perkins where received a complementary breakfast. The only negative was we could hear other guest talking when we were in the bathroom and other noises from our room. Easy on and off I 94. 10 day road trip and this was one of the best."
Best Western Tomah Hotel,4,Clean and Comfortable travel stop,We needed an overnight stop for our travels from Minnesota to Illinois. This hotel worked out great. Very clean and comfortable. Slept well. Breakfast vouchers for attached Perkins restaurant were great!

Best Western Tomah Hotel,4,"Good, hotel, free breakfast but not the usua",Seems like an older hotel but clean and comfortable with good service. The one thing that threw us off was that we were expecting the usual breakfast buffet but instead received vouchers for a specific breakfast or 5 off any menu item at Perkins next door. The kids got anything off the kids' menu for free. It was a good deal but disconcerting.

Baymont Inn & Suites Bowling Green,5,LOVED staying here,"From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty! Every.Single.Time we came back from whatever we were doing,we were greater with hello and how are you!!! Beds were comfy,pillows were too. Rooms were spacious. If I had one complaint it would be that the air conditioning blew right on to the queen bed closest to it. My husband fixed that by sitting a chair directly in front of it.We did not eat breakfast there but I'd recommend another hour onto that 9:00 cutoff ) Hotel is close to EVERYTHING.We stayed here and drove the 25 miles to mammoth cave and it was well worth it. You sure can't beat the 77 dollars a night for the service and cleanness of this hotel. Thanks so much Bay Mont of Bowling Green for making the last half of our mini Vaca awesome!"
Baymont Inn & Suites Bowling Green,2,loud,"I know this is an old building. The rooms are not sound proof. I heard very clearly the conversation the mother was having with her children in the next room. The shower did not get hot, warm enough, but not hot."

Baymont Inn & Suites Bowling Green,1,Noisy and Indifferant,"I was directed to the rear entrance but was unable to use the key card to open the door.

Best Western Harker Heights,3,customer,"The hotel is in a good convenient area. It was clean. I made a reservation for 2 nights and they neglected to tell me that the check out time was 11am. I decided to check out before the next day after 11 and the lady at the front desk was very rude and said that ""SHE TOLD ME"" the check out time. I explained to her that she did not tell me the check out time and she would not refund my bill for the 2nd day."

Super 8 Monticello,2,The room had a odor.,"the staff was very friendly, but the room smelled musty and the carpet felt dirty."
Super 8 Monticello,1,Not Heather Accessible,"The guest service informed me that my service dog would not be able to stay in the handicap accessible room with me. He offered me a pet friendly room, but it was not accessible. (I use a wheelchair so this was an unreasonable option!) He finally contacted a supervisor, who ok'd staying in the accessible room with my dog. Upon entering the room, the room was very tight. It was nearly impossible to maneuver past the bed. As a matter of fact, I didn't. In the bathroom, the toilet sat on the middle of the wall, nothing as far as grab bars. For a customer with balance issues, this makes it hard to toilet independently. It was frustrating that the room is considered to be accessible! I would be happy to consult with you to ensure that rooms are made accessible!"
Super 8 Monticello,5,Nice Hotel,"We stayed in a newly renovated room. It was very clean and very comfortable. WiFi was free. There was an onsite computer for guest use. Breakfast was adequate. Coffee was good. The hotel, considering the room rate and proximity to ammenities, and cleanliness, it cannot be beat."

Holiday Inn Express & Suites Austin South,4,Great hotel that needs shuttle service,"This hotel was great overall--clean, decent sized rooms, and good breakfast. However, the only problem was that I was told when I booked it that it had a free shuttle. We were counting on using this to get to and from ACL. There was no shuttle, so this added some extra cost and planning. I would stay here again."
Holiday Inn Express & Suites Austin South,5,Memorial Day!,"Went to the Memorial Day Celebration at the Texas State Cemetery like we do every year!! Close, with a Huge Room and Great Staff, KK Donuts in the Hotel Parking Lot, Good Pool and Great Breakfast as Well!"
Motel 6-albert Lea,1,"No Hot Water, No Cable","No cable, no hot water. Reported to staff/manager He said all of Albert Lea didn't have cable, and hot water always works...you just need to pull really hard on the faucet (which I did). No apologies, just stated we already offer the lowest price rate, and I can't do anything about it I thought I would take a chance since I was there for 1 night after reading reviews. My advice DON'T DO IT!! After a long hard day of work, a hot shower and cable is not expecting too much."
Motel 6-albert Lea,2,Room condition,"We were the only people staying that night. Across the road the hotel had many guests for that night...tells you something, does it not. Also our room had a noisy fan and the heat was hard to control"
Motel 6-albert Lea,2,Ok if you just need to sleep a few hours,"The hotel smelled funny, there was no elevator, there was no bar or chain on the door and it was hard to lock. The beds are on metal boxes. Every time you moved you sounded like an old metal desk."
Motel 6-albert Lea,1,Never again Motel 6!!!,"This hotel did not meet my expectations. The room was sparsely furnished and not clean. There was a bunch of hair behind the bathroom door where staff had not cleaned the bathroom properly. The bed squeaked with every move and it was the only piece of furniture to sit on. The ceiling above us squeaked as well. No desk, no chair, no in-room coffee service, and no place to sit and relax outside. The entry door keypad was completely busted and the parking lot was deteriorating badly. Other chains have provided us far more comfort at the same price."
Motel 6-albert Lea,3,No frills,"Don't expect anything other than a fairly decent place to sleep. When we checked in, the two coffee pots were empty. We asked for another pillow and were told one would be sent to the room. We never got it. There is no tissue (Kleenex) and don't expect complimentary shampoo and conditioner. In the morning when we checked out, the coffee pots were still empty. Having said all that, the room was clean and bed was pretty comfortable. Bathroom was clean and shower was hot so if that's what you are looking for, you will be satisfied."
Motel 6-albert Lea,5,I would stay there again,Needed a quiet place to spend the night during a cross country trip. This was in a quiet location and there was no noise heard from adjoining rooms. Wifi worked well and I got a good nights sleep. This is all I look for in a hotel. Would stay there again.
Mark Twain Hotel,5,Best Deep Dish Pizza,"We visited Uno's this past winter. The atmosphere is great, the servers were cutious and very nice people, and the pizza was killer. The manager came out and asked us how we were, this is always a good sign of a well ran restaurant. The waitress took very good care of us, and yes at the time there was not alot of business due to snowfall that day, she did stop to have a conversation with us.

Mark Twain Hotel,3,Night in Moline,Decided to stay at this hotel for convenience of walking to Cat Visitors Center and to the riverfront. My first thought when I walked into the front desk area was that this hotel appears to be a nice quit place to relax.

They were very accommodating. My room was clean and comfortable. I travel extensively for work and I got a good room at a great price."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Dekalb,3,Lowest cost in DeKalb,The rooms are nice. A bit noisy with the train but didn't bother us. Breakfast is not even worth mentioning. Our biggest issue was that I called a week ahead to make sure the pool would be open which was the only reason we picked this hotel and was told yes it would be opened. We got there and went... More
Drury Inn St Louis Collinsville,4,Great deal!,"No frills room, clean. Not high priced. The real seller for us was the hot dinner with free drinks. Then a hot breakfast also free. Food was good especially for dinner. We would definitely stay here again."
Best Western-woodstock Inn,5,Smooth (mostly),"Everything went as planned. Nice free breakfast. The free WiFi was a bit slow, the TV/Cable had some quirks but was manageable (no HD). The pool was bath temperature (Very Warm!). Shower had nice pressure, and the beds were firm but not hard. We had a problem one night with the lock on the bathroom door and the folks at the front desk were helpful."
Best Western-woodstock Inn,4,Return stay to the best in Woodstock..,"My return stay here was as good as the first and still better than the other main hotel in town. Solid customer service with clean, comforatble, and quiet rooms is what I look for while on the road and I found it here again here. The value is also spot on. Despite the ongoing stucco and paint work outside, it... More"
Best Western-woodstock Inn,5,A pleasant surprise!,We stayed here end of July 2015. We picked the room here because it was central to some places we were going on vacation. I don't know why this was rated at a 2!! If you want a 5 star hotel then book a five star hotel! Hotel was very clean and updated. Free breakfast was excellent. Pool was nice. Room was great. Only downside was beds weren't the greatest. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Can't beat the price and get all that anywhere else. Was a small hotel which was fine for us. Made it that much more homey. Would definatly recommend staying here.
Best Western-woodstock Inn,4,A single night stay,"We stayed one night after a full day of touring and driving. The staff were friendly and the room was clean - though a bit dated and in need of some service (a lamp was burned out). The breakfast was very tasty and the fella who was stocking was very attentive and helpful. Overall, a good stay."
Aloft Bolingbrook,5,Great Ambiance,"This is an upscale, modern hotel with the camaraderie of a hostel. The huge lobby has a giant fireplace, a billiards table, and a full bar, where guests were hanging out and socializing. Our room was attractive but smallish. The only hassle was that they charged for the breakfast on a per-item basis, which was mediocre quality and expensive. However,... More"

Comfort Suites-regency Park,3,No free breakfast!,"We checked in on April 29-30 2016 and were looking to enjoy a free breakfast as listed on the website for this property.

Four Points By Sheraton Chicago O'hare Airport,4,"Nice room, minus the cable service",It was great. I was just a little disappointed that the local channels would not come through on the tv. I was told a maintenance technician would be up to assist and no one ever showed.
Alpine Inn,4,Alpine Inn,You get what you pay for. The staff was terrific. The rooms need updating. Carpet was a bit worn. The breakfast was so so. Overall the place was clean and a bargain for the price. We would stay there again if in the area.
Alpine Inn,4,Affordable,"On my way out east, the perfect distance to travel for the day. Brought my bicycle into the room overnight after I drove over to the Rock River and road the trail there for a few miles. Fast/easy breakfast items coffee in the morning."

Drury Plaza Hotel Nashville Franklin,5,"Great Staff, Great Stay...","Staff does a very nice job. The second location I have stayed at and both experiences have been great. Close to downtown Franklin, 20 minutes to downtown Nashville. Very quiet and comfortable. Our stay at their location in Findlay, Ohio was equal to this."
Drury Plaza Hotel Nashville Franklin,5,Fantastic !,"Can't say enough about our stay at this Drury. It was in a very convenient location to local attractions, shopping, and restaurants (one attached to the hotel). The staff was helpful and cheerful and the place was spotless. Very happy to see this chain expanding to new areas of the country."

I'll certainly stay here again. All the staff is fantastic. Teri and Charlie during Kickback are especially fantastic and help to make your stay fun."
Hilton Garden Inn Bettendorf/quad Cities,3,Nice but overpriced,"While this is a very nice hotel I can't say that it is better than others in the area charging a lower price. Considering how much they charge you'd think they at least would offer a continental breakfast. Breakfast here is 10Thank you for your feedback, we do offer a Hilton Honors program,you are awarded points for each stay that offers great perks throughout the year, please consider signing up."
Island Country Inn,3,"Basic, very basic","One window, opens to walkway, no cross ventilation. It's convenient and that's about it. Free breakfast, free snoring nose strips!"
Island Country Inn,2,Go somewhere else,This place is old and dated. The bed was really uncomfortable. They put a thick pad on top of the mattress I guess to make it better. Instead it just gets wadded up when you sleep. The coverlet on to of the bed was worn and pilled and you don't even want to sit on it. The room had an odd smell. The breakfast buffet was pitiful. I'm so glad we only had to spend one night here.
Island Country Inn,1,Never again....,You get what you pay for. The rooms were old and beat up. I slept all of 2 hours the whole night as I felt like there were bugs crawling on me in the bed. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Breakfast was....a joke. Spend the extra and stay at a better hotel.

Top's Motel,4,Like an old fashioned motor court,"Park right in front of your door! Rooms have flat screen, wifi, micro, fridge. However, no coffeemaker. A little on the high side compared to similar places we've stayed, but still reasonable. No ice machine either."
Top's Motel,2,Do not recommend,"The motel is poorly managed and maintained. The smoking rooms reek of smoke and the non-smoking rooms are not much better. Expectation for a motel are naturally low, and this fits below average for a motel. The management was disappointing at best. Not worth your money or time."
Best Western Plus Newark/christiana Inn,5,Business Trip,What I Expected
Best Western Plus Newark/christiana Inn,1,won't again,The sink kept backing up. The bathtub leaked. There were gnats flying around i think because of the clogged drain. The air I on 60 degrees and it never got cold in the room before it would cut off for very long periods of time. Went in the pool night before we left broke out the next day all over. Jacuzzi was nice. room 118 beware

Best Western Plus Newark/christiana Inn,3,carpets are a problem,"If it wasn't for the carpets, this would have been a decent place to stay carpets are chemically sprayed on and it adds an irritating smell to the room-watch out for people with respiratory issues.

Best Western Plus Hotel At The Convention Center,4,Decent Hotel,The hotel was very very clean with up to date interior furnishings and bedding. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The reason there are only 4 stars is because there are no refrigerators / microwaves in the rooms and the hallways were very hot. I do not understand that. Thankfully the A/C in the rooms worked.

Bancroft Hotel,4,Fabulous location for visiting the college,"The hotel reminded me of a boarding house. Bedrooms were tiny, as was the ensuite bathroom. There is no elevator for the hotel, so it won't accommodate handicapped guests. The breakfast room is adequate and the breakfast was bare-boned (1 type of bread, 2 types of muffins, apple, oatmeal, yoghurt, granola) but fresh, and self-serve. The hotel is older, but... More"
Rancho Tee Motel,2,Barely Acceptable,It's pretty obvious the owner is letting this place run down while he collects exorbitant rates (weekends) for a room. My room was clean and very spacious.

The staff (especially Chris at the front desk) with restaurant recommendations and a local florist that delivered flowers that the hotel made sure where in the room when we arrived. Also, the champagne that was waiting with the flowers (charge of 28 but the champagne was great). All of the front desk staff, throughout the weekend, was so accommodating. We will definitely be back."

Pool is nice . View is nice. Liked kitchenette"

Seacrest Oceanfront Hotel,5,Ocean views and easy walk to town along sandy beach,"We stayed here as part of our road trip and found it to have nice rooms and views, both from the pool area and room balcony.

Seacrest Oceanfront Hotel,2,Pet friendly....kind of,Came here this past week with the kids and dog. Booked a pet friendly room on 2 different nights. There was a nice small dog bed and dishes in the closet for you to use during your stay. If your pet is more than 20 lbs the bed will probably be too small. There is a 25.00 extra charge per... More
Seacrest Oceanfront Hotel,5,Relaxing Interlude,My husband and I had a relaxing time. Our room was overlooking the ocean. The room was spotless and the staff is very cordial and accommodating.

Seacrest Oceanfront Hotel,5,Met all expectations and more,Had a really lovely time at Seacrest oceanfront.

Seacrest Oceanfront Hotel,3,Be sure you get what you paid for!,Hotel did not honor our online booking. We paid for an oceanview room and were given a room with a view only standing on the balcony!

Seacrest Oceanfront Hotel,4,Great Weekend Getaway,Beautiful location for a hotel. Love the fire pits on the hotel grounds that overlook the ocean. The hotel sits on above a beautiful big sandy beach that is great for family and yet still manages to be romantic.
Lincoln Plaza Hotel,3,I would stay for budget visit,The TV was out of order and only 1 set of wash clothes in the room for 2 occupancies.
Lincoln Plaza Hotel,3,Always a good 1 night stay.,I like coming here just because I need a clean and close place to sleep in the city.
Lincoln Plaza Hotel,3,"Budget-friendly, clean, and comfortable lodging.","We had a good stay at the Lincoln Plaza Hotel. The hotel decor is a bit outdated, so it was kind of like stepping back into the 1980's. But everything else was just fine about our stay. The check-in process was quick and easy. The staff was friendly. Our room was clean and comfortable. There is a refrigerator in the room for keeping items chilled. There was a coffee maker, as well, with both tea and coffee. The bathroom was small, but everything worked just fine. We needed extra towels and a visit to the front desk to ask for them had the towels delivered to our room in about five minutes. The hotel is located in the middle of Monterey Park, which is a majority Asian populated city. If you have an issue with being served by Asian staff, surrounded by Asian guests, and having people in your hotel speak a different language with each other when they are not speaking with you, then you might have issues staying at this hotel. But if you would like a clean, comfortable, budget-friendly place to stay when in the Los Angeles Area, the Lincoln Plaza Hotel should work nicely for you."
Lincoln Plaza Hotel,1,Worst hotel,Nothing thing was nice worst hotel I had ever in my life
Lincoln Plaza Hotel,3,Not so organized,"The location is convenient for my friends since they speak limited English, there are lots of Chinese restaurants and stores within walking distance. The hotel service was terrible, we waited at lobby for almost two hours before they can check us in because they were having trouble finding available rooms, we made the reservations weeks ago and I expect the rooms are ready when we arrive."
Lincoln Plaza Hotel,1,TERRIBLE HOTEL,"THE STAFFS HAVE NO MANNERS, THE ROOM WAS DIRTY, PILLOWS WERE STING, THE ELEVATOR HAD WATER, WE NEED TO BRING OUR LUGGAGE UP TO GET OUT OF THE DIRTY WATER."
Lincoln Plaza Hotel,4,Cheap Dim Sum,"This is probably the cheapest dim sum restaurant in SGV. When I say cheapest, not just the price but the portion of the dishes. You really get your moneys worth. Like their baked BBQ pork buns, three huge ones on one plate! Everything is decent in size. Get there early, like around 11AM or later after the lunch rush. Don't... More"
Aztec Hotel,1,A Diamond in the Rough,"The old Aztec Hotel on foothill blvd, ( route 66) was a gem, back in its day. Unfortunately for the past ten years while the hotel was under poor management it was never maintained. The entire establishment is dirty and run down. The rooms are very small, which was typical for hotels during that era. Some staff are friendly, others were not willing to help when needed. Bar is a local hangout with a pretty good Band. The property needs a complete overhaul."
Aztec Hotel,1,Horrible Experience,"92.50 for the smallest, dirtiest, hideous,smoke smelling room I've ever stayed in. Management is white trash and extremely rude to customers. There is no reason to ever stay in this hotel, it's garbage and should not be open to the public."
Chariot Inn,2,"Older road-side motel, simple, safe, near traffic noise","I was in town for a quick trip to attend a family event, wanted to save money, be near the event, and get sleep and a shower.

Pasea Hotel & Spa,5,"Cool hip hotel next to main street, shopping, and the beach",Great new hotel with amazing access to shopping and some nightlife - not to mention day time beach trips! If you get a higher floor you can see the entire boardwalk and down the coast in both directions. Pretty funny to watch the great HB police case off the night time beach goers!
Pasea Hotel & Spa,4,Good stay,"It's a brand new hotel with most rooms facing the sea. We had a road side room but the sound proof was very good that we hardly heard any road noises.

Courtyard by Marriott Scottsdale Salt River,5,Great experience,"Great Room! We came to Scottsdale to sight see, service was great, Front desk, house keeping and the Bistro( Mauro and Ed were great) went out of there way to make us feel comfortable! Hotel is very Quiet."
Courtyard by Marriott Scottsdale Salt River,5,Scottsdale's excellent secret,"I was not surprised by the excellent service and individual attention which was given to me other wedding guests that stayed at this lovely property. Marriott is know for its' excellent service and attention to detail regarding its guests. The accommodations are always immaculately maintained, the front desk staff is always willing to assist regarding any reasonable request. I am a travel concierge, because of their stalwart commitment to service, I will continue to recommend the Courtyard by Marriott to my clients. Lisa and Jean welcomed me and additional family members and ensured that we were well informed regarding shopping opportunities close by. We were availed of their free shuttle services within a 3 mile radius throughout our stay. Friends and family were all there to attend my daughter's wedding just a few miles away, their individual attention to each party member made my stay at Salt River especially exceptional. While the entire hotel staff was amazing, I can't begin to bestow the appropriate amount of gratitude and praise Lisa and Jean deserve for their unrivaled professionalism and basic kindness...Well Done!!!"
Hampton Inn & Suites St. Louis/South I-55,5,Hotel excellent in every way!,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel. First off the staff ---every single staff member--- was helpful, courteous and went out of their way to go extra mile to make sure our stay was great. The housekeeper even took the time to arrange my kids stuffed animals in fun and creative ways. Second this was the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed at. I'm a slight germ a phobe so hotel rooms can bother me. I was so comfortable in the room because it was so clean. Third, the breakfast was good and had a nice variety. Lastly the little touches like the lemon water at foyer, the milk and cookies at 8 each night and the treasure box for the kids at check out all made the stay extra memorable. Thank you for a wonderful stay. Heather"
Hampton Inn & Suites St. Louis/South I-55,5,Best Hampton Inn,"This is by far the best Hampton Inn my wife and I have ever stayed in, and we've been in quite a few. For that matter, it's one of the best of its class among all of the hotels we've known. We had a nice, clean suite, quiet, well lit, neatly arranged with a desk/divider between the very comfortable bed and the sitting area. Staff were friendly and polite, the breakfast good, prices reasonable. Little notes left by the cleaners were a nice touch. Our only complaint was that the wireless Internet kept dropping out on checkout the desk clerk apologized and said that the hotel has been trying to solve this problem (our room also had an ethernet cable, unusual these days, but I hadn't brought an adapter for my laptop). In spite of this - not enough to affect the rating - highly recommended!"
Hampton Inn & Suites Palestine,5,One of my favorite hotels in the WORLD,"We stay here every time we visit Palestine. The pool is warm and salt-filtered, so no chlorine burning eyes.

Hotel Sutter,3,Nice Effort with Room to Improve.,"The restaurant has a nice vibe. Staff are friendly and competent. Wine list a bit too simple. Food was good. The hotel is just average.

Hotel Sutter,4,Great find in Sutter Creek.,This establishment took over from the aging but historic Hotel Bellotti.

Wifi was a little inconsistent, but not too challenging. I would definitely stay again the next time I'm in Cambridge."
The Charles Hotel,5,Best Place to Stay in Cambridge,"I'm a Cambridge native. It used to be (during the 1950s) that working class people lived next to the academics and professionals. Cambridge had a small town feel and it was affordable for everyone. That's no longer the case. The Charles Hotel is pricey, but not much more than less grand places in Cambridge, especially if you get the package... More"

The Charles Hotel,5,Perfect.,"We stay here every time we're in Cambridge. It's just a stone's throw from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, so the location is perfect. On this visit, our room had a great view (we could almost see the River). The hotel is contemporary, but not in a cold, overly-sleek way. It has several restaurants, one of which occasionally doubles... More"

The Charles Hotel,4,You are paying for tradition and proximity to the square over luxury,I have been to the Charles several times over the last 20 years. Some parts of the hotel are consistent over the years: the rooms are clean and the staff is professional. But the experience isn't really a luxury experience with attention to small details. The hotel made a mistake around our rooms (they were supposed to be adjoining which... More
The Charles Hotel,5,Great but not Cheap,"Great hotel with great proximity to Cambridge and Harvard. Restaurants, services and gym are fantastic. Pricey but generally worth it. Connected to large independent fitness club so no fears of arriving in the morning and finding all the equipment taken. Henrietta's Table restaurant is great for breakfast - either business breakfast or with family."

Hotel Red,3,Not as nice as it was.,"This was always our favorite place to stay in Madison despite the parking difficulties. The hotel is very noisy as the building has many hard surfaces. The mattress on our bed was lumpy and needs replacing. As a hotel that allows pets, they should do a better job of cleaning the rooms. I love dogs, but am very allergic to... More"

Hotel Red,3,Average at Best.,We were excited to stay close to the McClain Center to see our son play soccer for UW. Room was unique but just ok otherwise. Breakfast was terrible and took forever. Waitress volunteered to pay. Would not recommend. The dog friendly thing was a big turn off.
Hotel Red,5,Customer Service over the top!,We did a girls night there and it was our first time staying. The location is easy to find and great parking. Once we entered the hotel it felt like you were in someone's home. The front desk staff was so wonderful and helpful planning our night out. They leave no attention to detail unnoticed. We started our night out... More

Atlantis Oceanfront Inn,4,Very Refreshing and Exceptional Friendly Front Desk,So many of these hotels act like they are doing you a favor for letting you stay with them.

Plaza Motel,1,Go to Motel 6 in Danvers!,"We were looking for a place to stay outside of Boston and all the motels in this area seemed to be full.

Hampton Inn-seattle/everett,5,Great Hotel!,"They were very accommodating. We had a business meeting in Seattle, and we had to travel there with our toddler.

Hotel Aiken,2,Weekly traveler,"Was really excited to stay in a historical hotel. Got in very late and requested a very quite room. Was informed that there would be no one at the front desk after 11:00. Got in my room and settled in, noticed toothpaste in the sink, hair on the floor and in the tub but of course by this time there was no one at the front desk..Turned the TV off and went to bed but the music from the nightclub kept me awake until they closed at 2:am. I will never stay there again! Very disappointed!!"
Hotel Aiken,1,OMG...Hotel rooms dirty and no heat IN ROOM,Room had wall paper and curtain falling down Plus blanket was dirty. Can deal with that but we had no heat and maintenence staff would not be back until the morning. Room was freezing cold. I have pictures if Expedia wants to see them. Remove this hotel from your listing please.
Hotel Aiken,5,"About 10 miles from interstate, but really quaint.","We were on the road, and booked this right before midnight. Really the only hotel available at that time. Quaint hotel in an adorable town, but we had a truck with 18 foot trailer - no parking! We parked 3 blocks away on the street! No problems! The hotel has a few bars and there was defiantly some parting going on, but you could not hear it from our room! Hotel had elevator, but was not working at that time and we had to climb one big set of steps! Room was clean but 'old' and charming! Think we had a 'spirit' that messed with my night lite, but was 'friendly'! Nice breakfast in the AM - coffee was amazing! Food was nicely prepared and fresh! Desk clerk at midnight was very nice and accommodating (forgot his name!) sorry! Would love to come back to 'explore' this town and would defiantly stay here again!"
Hotel Aiken,4,"Perfect location. Downtown, in a small, old town.","Built in 1898 this hotel has some charm. Priced like one of the new, right off the freeway type hotels, this one is special. Downtown, small old town with lots of history and plenty of good shopping and restaurants."
Hotel Aiken,4,All by myself,"It was okay for the price. I was not there during the daylight hours. It was very quiet Needs a little up grade. Afraid of elevator. I was a female,alone,in an unfamiliar town, but i felt safe there. Other than upgrade, it was a pleasant stay."
Hotel Aiken,2,Party Hotel,"Its old, worn out and a bit dingy. Centrally located amongst a number of good bars and places to eat is the only reason I stay here. At least the sheets are always clean."

Aloft Durham Downtown,5,Great stay / good value at new Aloft property.,"Really enjoyed my stay at the Aloft in downtown Durham. The property has an excellent location, nice amenities (consistent with Aloft brand), and a very friendly, helpful staff. Rooms were the highlight. New, clean, and comfortable. Some noise with adjacent construction and nearby rail line, but not a major nuisance. Park is 10, but only available in top four floor... More"
Carter Lodge,4,Just the right place,"The owners of this hotel are absolutely lovely! It's a wife and husband duo and you can tell they put a lot of sweat equity and heart and soul into running their lodge. The rooms were sufficient. We could tell that some updates had been made in recent years however, it was a hodgepodge of decorations. In the bathroom in... More"
Comfort Suites Outlet Center,5,Best Choice in Asheville,Located right beside Asheville Outlet Mall. A big plus for my wife and daughter. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Always smiled and greeted us when we entered. This will be our first choice for a hotel for all our future visits to Asheville. Five to ten minutes from downtown.
Comfort Suites Outlet Center,2,Bathroom issues,"The room was okay. But bathroom extremely small. Also, it looked like the beginnings of black mold in between the caulking of the shower/bath tub surfaces. Toilet very low to the ground.... The uncomfortable contribution of the bathroom set the precedence for the sentiments felt about the hotel. But, it was a good location and the front desk staff were very helpful in pinpointing attractions and waterfalls in the area. I can't really comment on breakfast since we slept in and missed it daily"
Comfort Suites Outlet Center,3,Location on a budget,We stayed here for location. Easy access to Asheville and Hendersonville and the NC Arboretum.
Comfort Suites Outlet Center,5,Great  place to stay,Great stay. Desk clerk was no nice and helpful. Great beds. Clean room. Location location location!!!
Comfort Suites Outlet Center,4,Nice hotel close to great outdoor activities.,This is a very clean hotel with spacious rooms in a beautiful scenic locale. They offer a full hot breakfast and have coffee available 24/7 and the rates are very reasonable. My only gripe would be that they should have more than one elevator for as large as this hotel is. A lot of people opted to take the stairs.
M -37 Motel,3,Cozy,"Affordable, clean, comfortable and friendly. Was surprised, for the price I paid to stay. I had expected a whole lot worse. Close to every thing in town. I had hot water and had no problems brushing my teeth. I don't believe it is plastic on the mattresses but is a mattress protector. I have seen the results of bed bugs... More"
Schleichers Landing,1,camping,"unhappyr We camped there last year. This year we considered going back but the river has flooded the area and our campsite is still muddy and it is July 18th. The owner still wants the full summers rate for camping which, by the way, she raised the prices this year. The owner is constantly sitting at her picnic table and scowls at the campers. She doesn't smile. When she told us that the rates couldn't be discounted we told her that we wouldn't be camping there this year. She said fo...view morer us to get our stuff out of there in one week or she would call the authorites. She said we couldn't camp there ever again. Her son is wonderful and helps his mom run the campground but he has to listen to his controlling mother. She also charges 2 dollars a head for visitors. She's all about the almightly dollar. She called us unfaithful. She even doesn't like our 2 little daschunds. They need to be tied up. Save yourself some money and heartache. DON'T STAY HERE!r r rview less"
Sleep inn,3,Not bad accomodation but more minuses than +'s,"We had very few +'s at this hotel and several minuses.

Days Inn St. Louis - Lindbergh Boulevard,5,"nice for the price, very cool pool/game room","We stayed 1 night in a smoker room, we don't smoke but this was the only option I could select. The room was pretty dated but still seemed clean. Outaide stairs to get up to our room were a little rickety. Pool/game room area was very neat! Breakfast was good. Staff very polite and friendly. They even gave us a little bag with a few treats and bottle water when we arrived so that was nice too! Would stay there again."

Days Inn St. Louis - Lindbergh Boulevard,3,Just leave me be,"Hotel is dated room was fine. Convenient for a race in downtown st. Louis for an out of tower. Was called several times prior to stay, and called after stay which got annoying. The after stay phone call was trying to sell me on additional stays at other hotels. I found this incredibly frustrating. I have never had this happen with any other hotel I have booked through here."
Days Inn St. Louis - Lindbergh Boulevard,5,Spring Break 2016,"We had a great time. When I booked the Hotel I booked it for the inside pool for Spring Break for my grandchildren.

Days Inn St. Louis - Lindbergh Boulevard,4,Family friendly,"Great place to stay with the kids! It has a nice pool, an indoor play area, and an arcade. The breakfast is what you would expect from other hotels not overly fancy. The hotel itself is a little run down but not particularly dirty. Most of the staff is very helpful. We booked two rooms and were upgraded to two huge three bed suites with two bathrooms so there was plenty of room for my family of five. We would stay again."
Quality Inn,4,"Comfortable, clean, quiet.","Pulled in late. No prob getting a room that allowed our small dog. Room was non-smoking, fresh, and clean! Got a hot shower and good nights sleep.

America's Best Inn Suites,1,America's Worst,"This property does not look bad from out front, but room 118 is the worst I have ever seen anywhere. The dead bolt would not lock.

InterContinental San Francisco,4,Excellent hotel with relatively bad internet provision,"This is San Francisco in Silicon Valley, so when a hotel charges over 15 per night for internet access you expect a decent connection.

InterContinental San Francisco,4,Great location but really expensive,"Great rooms with huge beds, but very expensive. Amazing view over the city if you live higher up.

There is an indoor pool and a spa... More"

Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,4,Holiday Inn Express BWI Airport West,"So there is nothing wrong with this hotel. It is average and what you would expect of Holiday Inn Express. I am glad that we got the reservations on Hotels.com. The rooms were conveniently priced and I thought the services of the hotel were fine for the price I had paid. However, when we inquired about staying an extra day the room cost twice as much. I understand that getting reservations early and using a service like hotels.com is much cheaper but I could not see paying twice as much money for such a mediocre hotel."
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,Ideal,La habitacion ligeramente reducida. Falto mobiliario para desempacar y empacar maletas. por lo demas excelente. muy recomendable
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,Pleasurable,Awesome! We had a wonderful time. The hotel have a amazing breakfast every morning! Definitely will stay again.
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,2,Not impressed,"We have always been extremely satisfied with the Holiday Inn Express hotels that we have stayed in in the past, especially the breakfast buffets, and that was why we again chose a Holiday Inn Express when we were passing through the Baltimore area. Were we ever wrong on this one!! The buffet was very limited, hardly any hot items and what was supposed to be hot was actually stone cold (i.e. the gravy for the biscuits). The biscuits were rock hard. The scrambled eggs were a very bad version of imitation. Seemed like the person running the buffet was using week old biscuits and figured the warming lamps would heat up the gravy so she did not have to. I have never had a worse breakfast anywhere. If you are planning on getting your fill at this buffet - forget it. We had to go out to breakfast after checking out just to keep from starving. We hadn't balked at the room fee because we assumed the buffet would be worth the extra money - Boy were we wrong!!"
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,4,Good hotel,"The hotel was convenient to the interstate, the mall and Baltimore. Breakfast was good. The room was comfortable and the staff was pleasant."
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,Great Stay!!!,Loved our visit. Would definitely room here again in the future.
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,An Overnight Stay,I had an overnight stay and I found everything fine.
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,Hidden gem by airport.,Great hotel close to BWI Airport. Unexpectedly pleasant stay. Ruby friendly and informative staff. Great Italian restaurant with a short walking distance. Very short shuttle to airport. WILL Absolutely Come again
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,4,No bath tub.,Everything was great with the hotel except our bathroom. There was no bathtub. I believe it was probably a handicap room. Not having a bathtub caused water to go all over the floor which caused me to slip on the floor.
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,Nice accommodations location,Easily accessible to highways shopping. Since I've stayed in this area before I will definitely stay here again.
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-BWI Airport West,Nice place to spend the night. Very close to car rental.
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,"Great value, great location","This hotel was cheaper than the other near-BWI hotels that were available when I needed one. Yet, a bit to my surprise, it was a really nice place. The only small negative is there is only one computer and printer for printing boarding passes."
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,4,Nice girls getaway,"We were there for a girls night out, it was nice and in a great location, the rooms were nice, carpets was stain free but needed to be cleaned had a slight odor"
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,3,Close to everything,"It was Ok, but the conditions of the room needs to be more light and more clean."
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,Convenient,"Stayed here after getting in on a very late flight. Quick check-in, clean room, nice complimentary breakfast."
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,3,Not Impressed,"I'm glad that we went through Expedia for a lower rate. I would have been very upset if we had paid full price. One of the elevators did not work. The air did not work in the whole building. Only the air units within the rooms worked. The place was very stuffy and seemed unorganized at times. All in all - since we were there for a Lax tournament it was decent. But, I would not go there for a get-a -way."
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,4,Nice hotel close to mall/casino,"Hotel clean, convenient, breakfast good, staff friendly and I would stay again."
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,4,Near BWI,"We had two rooms on the second floor. Even though the rooms were listed as non-smoking it was evident the rooms had been smoked in at some point in the past. When we talked to an employee about the smell and were told the second floor at one time was the smoking floor. The smell was evident in both rooms. It probably was more pronounced for us, because the occupants in both rooms have never been smokers. Other than the smoking smell the rooms were fine."
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,3,Review,The location is the best thing about this hotel. The walls are pretty thin so noise can be a problem. But what can you expect from a moderate/lower priced hotel
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,3,Nice hotel but a lot of hidden fees.,I was charged twice for my room and when I checkout thereally is another charge to my account which they could not figure out.
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,4,Good stay,Very nice.

It was a very clean room and the hotel had a pleasant staff. This hotel is only about 5 minutes from the mall and numerous other stores and restaurants, so very accommodating! I would definitely stay here again!!"
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,Great rental car return location.,This is a great location for turning in your rental car.
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,This hotel is a good choice for the Baltimore area,"Our stay was nice. The hotel is located not too far away from Mayland live and the Mills mall. If you don't have transportation of your own (as we did not since we were visiting from out of state)the hotel does offer transportation within a 5 mile radius which includes the casino and the airport. The airport is priority for the hotel so if there is an airport trip or pick up, the airport will take priority over the casino or the mall. The casino and airport are not walkable even though you can see the casino from the hotel window as there are no sidewalks all the way. The breakfast is complimentary and is better then we have seen in most hotels. We do advise you to go before 7:30 for the breakfast as it gets crowded down there. The walls are very thin and you can hear the people on the other side of the wall if they are loud. The people on the other side of us were loud until close to 6AM when they finally went to sleep. Since I keep the same hours when I travel as to when I don't, this part was disturbing to me."
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,2,Solid budget option,"Room was not ready on time, but perfectly fine for the cost"
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,4,A night away from the kids,My husband and I stayed here for one night to get away for a night away from the kids. The hotel is nice and I would stay again.

Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,"Clean, courteous, and comfortable","I can't think of anything I would have changed. JoAnn, the person at the desk, was amazing--managed to juggle phone calls and a line of people with courtesy and grace. The accessibility to Annapolis, rates, and cleanliness were outstanding. We'll definitely be back!"
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,5,Great price and great stay!,I was really impressed with my stay! It was nice and clean. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was good! I would say yes I t is well worth it!
Holiday Inn Express Baltimore-Bwi Airport West,4,Housekeeping,"There were four people staying in the room. Only had 3 sets of towels. Told the front desk, they said housekeeping would bring another set. Never happened. Saw 1 person from housekeeping in the hall way. I asked for towels, she pointed to her cart down the hall and told me to get my own. Very rude. Also only 1 bench in front for you to be able to go have a cigarette. Could never sit and relax."

Holiday Inn Express Suites Clinton,5,Great value and great room,"Got this hotel because of proximity to water park next door, booked kind of late so had to get a king suite.

Holiday Inn Express Suites Clinton,4,Nice hotel,"The hotel was clean and comfy.

Drury Inn Suites Dayton North,4,Pet Friendly and a bonus!!,"This was our first stay in a Drury property. After check in, we requested to switch rooms, as we were on the first floor, which was a bit noisy. The clerk immediately offered us an alternative, but indicated the room was a bit 'unusual'.

Hotel Prince Spafford,1,the worst hotel in America,"My husband and I had to stay at this hotel for one night. I have never been to such a terrible place. I have been to the 3rd world countries, but have not seen such a shabby room. The room was disgusting (although the sheets seemed clean). The furniture had spots, tear, and looked like it was picked up off the curb. Nightstands and table had cigarette burns on them. The most terrible thing was that the room reeked of nicotine! I had a hard time sleeping because of the smell. When I got home I had to wash all my clothes. No one should stay in this hotel, unless for punishment! This hotel is a 4-floor building and the elevator is not working, which seems permanent. There is is no phone in the room, so if we had a problem, we needed to go downstairs and then back up."

Fairfield Inn Corbin,5,Friendly front desk staff,"Stayed here for an overnight on way home. Susan at front desk was friendly and accomodating during checkin. Room, pillows, bed, wi-fi was very good.

Fairfield Inn Corbin,1,Efficient Help Needed,"My friend and I stayed here last Friday (2 July).

Howard Johnson Express Inn/Airport,4,good value,Good for a one night stay for a low price
Howard Johnson Express Inn/Airport,1,DON'T STAY HERE!!  You have been advised.,"Worst hotel experience I have ever had. While waiting to check in, I overheard the 2 gentleman in front of me, basically planning their party in the room they were getting and the reception told them where the liquor store was. The reception clerk was nice, and checked us in quickly. That was the best thing about this experience. My wife and I walked into the room and we're immediately hit with a terrible smell, and before we could complain the phone rang in the room, which was the reception desk calling to tell us that she should not have put us in that room because of the smell, and to come to the desk for new keys to a different room, which we obliged. We got our new keys and went to the new room, which smelled better, but looked sketchy, so we pulled back the covers on the bed to see ants crawling around. This was the moment we decided to check out and went right across the street to the Hampton Inn, which was great and highly recommended. We never stayed at this hotel and never will. All I needed was a clean bed to stay in for a few hours so I could catch a flight, but this hotel couldn't even provide that. In fact this hotel just seemed like a party spot for locals and would not feel comfortable even parking my car in the parking lot. It's really a shame that this hotel is like this. It's in a great location and could be nice. Shame on me, as I did not heed the warning signs from the other reviews. Thought it would be okay for a few hours sleep. I was wrong"
Howard Johnson Express Inn/Airport,2,I was just a little disappointed.,"The room was very small, to have a full and queen size bed in it. And I clean home for a living and the bath room needs really down to using a tooth brush around the tub and floor, and I took the empty toilet paper roll out to put in the new one and the dirt I saw behind that empty roll was bad I left it out so the house keeper would see the dirt and what ever else was in there. And another chair in the room would be nice, a person can only set on the bed for just a little while then the back hurts."
Howard Johnson Express Inn/Airport,1,NEEDS HELP,"breakfast was bad, room not clean and in need of repair, unprofessional appearance of staff, Dirty linins."
Budget Inn of America,4,Updates,The front building in this two building motel has been updated to nicer rooms. Staff is friendly and nice.

Courtyard by Marriott Houston Brookhollow,1,Terrible customer service.,"Terrible. I spent my last penny reserving my room and i didn't see anything about a deposit under the small print tab, so I thought I was all paid up. Suddenly, after having spent nearly half an hour checking-in with their highly unprofessional staff just before I was given my keys so I could go find my room, the room keys didn't work on my room. So I walked all the way to the lobby, this time with my bags in tow, only to find out that they deactivated my room keys because they weren't able to charge card for incidentals. Which is when I said, of course not...I spent my last penny reserving this place online and there was no mention of a deposit in your 'small print' tab online. Every room I've reserved through Hotels.com, that has charged me a deposit, mentioned a deposit or incidentals charge in their small tab. Well I cancelled my reservation and asked for my money back so I could rent another room elsewhere. The manager cancelled my reservation and stated that he would be refunding my money, but he never did. I was not able to rent another room...I was broke."
Courtyard by Marriott Houston Brookhollow,4,The best courtyard in Houston,"I've stayed at several Marriott's especially in the Houston area. This experience has been one of the best. Check was quick smooth. The staff was pleasant and efficient.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,4,Handy location,"Located in good proximity to Metro station and lots of eateries. Hotel has seen some wear and tear, but was a good value for us. Heat in our room wasn't working and that was repaired right away. Sadly, we never did get a clock/alarm that worked."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,2,Bad Condition,Old rooms that smell like an ash tray everything looks old
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,5,Close to Metro and Downtown Sliver Spring,"The room was very comfortable. We used the pool every night, the lifeguard was professional and active. Loved the fact that the Metro was less than a half mile walk, we walked there every day for the trip into D.C. Many shops within walking distance of the hotel, also movie theaters. Breakfast buffet was good, large assortment of foods."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,4,Mini-Honeymoon...,"I was very excited about the occasion - our short honeymoon (longer one to follow on our first anniversary) but was disappointed by one thing...the bathroom in the DoubleTree was so small that you had to actually come into the room and move over to the side JUST to close the door. Maybe it was because we had the special price rate, but I expected better from a Hilton brand hotel... Other than that, the room was nice, average size and the staff was very friendly. When they saw us come in (we were still in tux and wedding gown), they offered congratulations and of course, the cookies were excellent!!!"
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,3,Needs some sprucing up,"Convenient location and overall pleasant, one night stay, but rooms and common areas, hallways, pool, need some maintenance--chipping paint and bathroom grout, and we found a dirty washcloth left behind hanging on the shower curtain rod."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,5,Nice hotel close to Metro,Beautiful hotel. Rooms clean. Pool very nice. Restaurant in hotel was excellent- food and mix drinks delicious. Only critique would be needing to ask for more than 2 towels (in a room we checked in with 4 ppl).
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,5,Excellent,We had a very pleasant 3 day stay. Would stay here next time my family and I are in town.
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,3,Tournament Stay,It was ok. I came back because i used the hotel Last year for the same tournament. Rate was good. But I missed my first round because the wake up call did not go through. When you hit the button for the wake up call an automated voice just says Thank you for your wakeup call I called the front desk and set the call but it never came through. Also requested a taxi and it never showed up
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,3,International flavor of Silver Spring and DCMetro,"Good location and generally comfortable hotel, albeit somewhat cramped. Close to international restaurants of Silver Spring and short walk to Metro for access to all of DC. Room/hotel was clean and pleasant but showing age in some facilities. Friendly and helpful staff - very accommodating."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,4,Good location hotel,"This is a very good location hotel in Silver Spring, the staff welcome me with some fresh warm cookies, very nice! Room is clean but no refrigerator and micro way , this really uncomfortable for me, and no convenience parking, valet only, but one night after 9 pm I come back they said no more parking, and I have to hunt for parking outside, this is terrible. But hotel is good ."

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,4,Good for staying near Silver Springs downtown,"I booked at this hotel because on the NIH Clinical Center website, it was one of the hotels listed as convenient to the NIH. However, that is false! You can take the metro red line to the NIH, but it will take you a long time, as it is several stops away. One morning, it took me 2 hours from leaving the hotel to arriving at the NIH because there was track maintenance! If you are in town to visit the NIH, I don't recommend staying here. Otherwise, the hotel is fine, the room was a little small, but clean. Also, the elevator interiors could use some upgrading. The carpet was dirty and ragged."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,5,GREAT STAFF! BUT THATS NOT THE ROOM I BOOKED.,"The hotel did not have to room I reserved. So I was bribed with free breakfast and free parking. Although it was a nice jester it still doesn't make up for me being placed in a room that did not accommodate my party. I booked 30 days in advance yet these people saw it fit to check other people into those rooms knowing that they had other guests arriving that booked the same room. A guest behind me was told the same thing. The staff was incredibly nice and graceful buy, I guess you have to when greedy corporations overbook hotels and leave them to deal with the customers."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,4,"Nice hotel, great location","I've stayed at this hotel twice. Each time was only for one night, however, so I can't comment much on housekeeping other than to say my room was always clean and presentable upon each check in. This last time I did have an issue with the outlets on the desk next to the televison, so I had to make my tea by my nightstand with the provided coffee maker. It would also be a great convenience if they had a mini fridge and microwave in each room. But other than those minor issues, I can't complain and would return. The cookies are delicious as well."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,3,"Clean and adequate, not friendly",Rudeness at front desk. When we checked in the front desk person was unfriendly and short of patience with my hard of hearing issue. We witnessed a very insulting exchange from a front desk person to another guest. Housekeepers were very pleasant and helpful. Rooms were small and did not seem up to the Doubletree standard we have seen in other Doubletree hotels.
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,5,Great Stay,Stayed in the 2 room king suite. It was perfect. Loved the separate living room. Nice and clean and comfy bed. This hotel has room service and they took care of us very well. The valet were awesome and fast.
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,5,DoubleTree downtown Silver Spring,very pleasant staff
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,3,"Nice hotel, makes a lot of mistakes.",Hotel was beautiful. Parking is weird. Paid 20 a night or you have to figure out how to park outback for free. No microwave or fridge in room only avaliable in suites. They kept messing up on room charges. Charging a 150 deposit fee saying it's a 50 fee per night you stay. Didn't make sense. Double charger a friend who was staying in the room next to ours. The staff was nice. I think it was a lot going on due to graduation season.
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,3,My Double Tree Stay,"I find it a little too noisy. The walls are like paper, so whatever was said in the next room felt like it was in my room. Also, the halls were pretty noisy until late at night."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,4,This hotel worked well for our family trip.,Our family spent 4 nights at the hotel while we toured Washington DC. It was an easy walk to the Metro each day and the hotel was clean.
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,5,My stay.,"It was my first visit to the area and It was close to all areas I visited. It was Close to shops, restaurants and in walking distance to Whole Foods. There was also a very nice restaurant MRS K's TOLLHOUSE nearby."

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,4,Hotel in Silver Spring Maryland,"Hotel ist ca. 10-12 min zu Fuss von der U-Bahn nach Washington D.C. entfernt. Es gibt in Silver Spring verschiedene Restaurants und Shopping Moeglichkeiten. Klassisches Business Hotel, dass eine gute Alternative zu den Stadthotels direkt in Washington D.C. darstellt. Preis-Leistungs-Verhaeltnis passt."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,4,Great for a DC visit without being right in DC.,"Hotel is very affordable, considering its a well kept hotel, in a very nice area, just outside a major city (with hotels 4 times the price near by). Easy access to and from the highways, and just a few blocks from the Metro and MARC stations. Highly recommend and will definitely consider staying here again."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,5,Enjoyed and plan to return again,"The service was friendly, helpful and outgoing. The room was clean and beds comfy. Walls a little on the thin side and no mini fridge was our only complaint along with an aggressive shower head. Yes I would return to this hotel. The food was good and the people who worked their were outstanding."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,4,Confusion at the front desk,"The hotel itself was good, good location,very close to downtown silver spring. there are public parking decks nearby (really don't need valet parking unless you are extra lazy). BUT the front desk was really sloppy. FIRST they didn't have our reservation in their system and wanted to charge us with the current rate which was 40 more expensive. THEN they didn't include the breakfast that CAME WITH our reservation. So we had to go back and forth with the front desk to settle these issues, which is NOT FUN."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,5,"THE GOOD, BAD AND UGLY","ONLY HAS VALET PARKING WHICH IS A PAIN AS ON 1 TIME THEY HAD A LOT IS FULL SIGN OUT FRONT, SO HAD TO PARK IN A PUBLIC LOT 2 BLOCKS AWAY. ALSO 1 DAY WE DID NOT GET OUR NEWSPAPER--THEY RAN OUT AND TOLD ME I COULD WALK 3 BLOCKS AND BUY ONE. MY WIFE ORDERED ROOM SERVICE, IT NEVER CAME SO SHE CALLED AND IT WAS READY, NO ONE HAD BOTHERED TO BRING IT UP. THE FIRST DAY, HAD TO GET MAINTENANCE TO ROOM TO SHOW ME HOW TO TURN ON LIVING ROOM LIGHTS. ALL SORTS OR TRICKS NEEDED. ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, THE ROOM WAS CLEAN , SUPER BED TO SLEEP IN AND THE STAFF WAS REALLY NICE AND FRIENDLY."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,5,In the Heart of Silver Spring,"Nicely situated in downtown Silver Spring within walking distance of the revitalized shopping/restaurant district. We seemed locked in to the Valet Parking which was not terrible at 15 for a weekend day. Our 6th-floor ice maker was not working so we had to get ice from one of the other floors...not a big deal, either."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,5,GREAT,My family and i enjoyed our stay. The room was clean and comfy. The staff was very professional and polite. Breakfast was delicious.
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,3,Friendly staff!,"Staff very friendly and rooms very nice. One problem with room above us having a party and very loud, had to call front desk at 2:45 a.m. and again at 3:15 a.m. before they were able to get them to quiet down. Otherwise, good experience and again a wonderful staff."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,4,A nice option,"We were for a week with our eleven month baby and it was a nice experience.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,2,Not worth the money,"For a Hilton the rooms, small bathtub, and noise in the rooms was horrible. I could hear everything from the room above me and rooms next to me. This was definitely not worth 234 a night or not up to Hilton standards. I would not stay there again. The people that worked there were top class though."
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Washington DC - Silver Spring,5,Great place to stay!,"Started with front desk people getting me into my room early...excellent. Received my hot, chocolate chip cookie upon check-in...perfect. Spot was about 3 blocks from the METRO station...plus. Staff was really attentive and helpful."
Best Western Plus Glenview-Chicagoland Inn Suites,5,By far the best Park-Sleep-Fly hotel,"We chose this Best Western because it offered up to 3 weeks free parking with Park-sleep-fly.

Best Western Plus Glenview-Chicagoland Inn Suites,4,"Nice, but noisy","Very good hotel, but the close proximity to the toll highway made it a little on the noisy side. ps Why does Chicago, or is it Illinois, charge 1.90 for the toll road and not 2.00 Just seemed odd to someone from a land with no toll roads."
Best Western Plus Glenview-Chicagoland Inn Suites,5,Very nice stay. Great value.,"Came to town to bury my father in law in family plot. We had a total of seven people in three double rooms-we were all very comfortable. Breakfast was very good, hotel employees courteous and helpful. Only negative was the bathrooms were small. But, they were clean. Overall, value was great, room was clean, and we were in a safe part of town. We were on the highway side, which was a little noisy, but I had my earplugs. No one else was bothered by the noise. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a room not backed up to the highway. Hotel was great with accommodating all of our requests."

Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,3,Suspicious Activity Around hotel,"Overall our stay was ok, Staff was not helpful when checking in. One attendant said she will help you in a minute after she gets off phone. Then after she was off and I stood there for few minutes she said can i help you. I said we are checking in, She said that the other attendant will help me!! Finally checked in, Room was ok, Nothing spectacular although the mirror was so clean my wife thought there was another room. lol Biggest downfall was that there seemed to be a lot of coming and going late at night/early morning. Hotel is right behind a questionable restaraunt. We did not have any issues though, just a feeling of concern,"
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,4,Update,Needed a bed that was supportive not lumpy. Too much constru tion noise outside. Need to go around building not to have to climb steps to get to room.
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,2,Eh,"My family and I stayed here for the weekend to do the Across the Bay 10k events. The hotel is older and the condition shows it. Furniture and carpet show many signs of wear and tear. The pool was not open because it was November. The front desk was very friendly and helpful when we called down or stopped to ask questions. Maid service did an excellent job of cleaning, making the beds, and giving us fresh bath supplies. Breakfast was very yummy with many different options. There is a grocery store, gas station, and place to eat all within walking distance. The neighborhood didn't seem the best at night so we stayed in the room when it got late. The room doors are all on the outside of the building which I really don't care for due to safety. Overall not terrible but you get what you pay for and I was trying to save a few dollars."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,2,Wouldn't stay here for free,"I stayed there for a week on a business trip. I wasn't looking for anything special, but The hotel seemed rundown. I didn't realize that that the corridors were external, which isn't a huge problem, but they were painting them while I was there making it inconvient to get around. The room and bathroom were shabby as well. What really did it for me though was when I packing to check out on the last day I found a small broken piece of glass tube under the bed. Curiousity got the best of me so I took it the training class I was finishing up and asked a police officer in the same class what looked like to him. He said that it was a piece of crack or meth pipe."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,4,"Good Value, Good Location","The staff was very friendly and helpful! Some of the furniture is worn and needs to be replaced. However, the hotel is very clean. All in all I would say this was a good value, close to everything, lots of shopping and restaurants and only 10 minutes from the Inner Harbour."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,4,It was OK.,"This is hard to do because the owners are really nice, but I have to be honest. There is a smell that seems to be in every Days Inn I've ever stayed in. Like..the rooms have a TASTE to them that isnt pleasant. I'm not talking about smoking rooms. My room was non-smoking, and it had that taste. I think it may be a product/room freshener or something that lingers. The furniture had sticky spots even after the room was cleaned, and I think its from that product. The smell gets all in your clothes, cigarettes..not good. Would I stay again Maybe. The pool was fun. The Asst Manager came to help me with an appliance issue, and while he did some things, he was supposed to come back and he never did. The pool was fun. There are all kinds of shopping and food around there. Wal-Mart/Golden Corral around the corner, good food right next door (mostly fried food though). Would I stay there again Maybe..but only AFTER seeing/smelling my room first."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,2,Not great,Room smelled waited 45mins for shuttle
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,5,Great for the money!!!,"I recently stayed at the Days Inn in Glen Burnie and I really appreciated its location in relationship to the airport (BWI) and shopping malls, which was the intent of my trip. The staff was great the facility was above my expectation and I would recommend this hotel to anyone just looking for a place to lay your head."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,5,get away,Would stay there again.
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,5,Cleanliness of the rooms was great.,I was beside the steps and people was up and down those stairs all night and early in the morning. I really didn't get my proper rest that I needed. And they were so loud.
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,4,get what you pay for,"Older hotel needs updating past the front entrance. Rooms were big, but needed updating ."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,2,close to inner harbor.,After finding the comforter was stained my husband asked the front desk for another blanket and they gave us one. It appeared that a lot of people actually live at the hotel.
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,3,Nice budget hotel,The hotel was perfect for a place to lay your head. Conveniently located.
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,3,This was an average hotel not bad for the money.,Our stay we very brief -- only overnight. It was average. Nothing negative.
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,5,Great Hotel for Our Valentine's vacation!!!!,Came down for Valentine's day for a little vacation and enjoyed every second. Bed was very comfortable and the room was nice and big for our 4 night stay.
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,2,Stay there,"You want to hear about my stay Well,,,, the first room that I was issued the heater did not work. The second room I was issued the TV did not work. At the end of the day the last thing I want to do is be shuffled around from room to room!!!!!! The cleaning crews are ether not trained correctly, or dont care. The floor in the bathroom was dirty and had long ladies hair all over. I wont be stopping there EVER again!!!! You wanted to hear about it,,,, now you have!!!! What will you do Lets see!!!"
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,2,"Poor service, Needs cleaning","My daughter and I stayed for one night. I checked in around 8:00 PM and no one was at the desk and there was no bell or any other way to notify staff we were waiting. After a short wait someone came in from a side office area and checked us in, but made no acknowledgement that we were waiting. Shortly after we got to the room I picked up the remote to turn on the TV and found the back cover for the batteries was missing. I pressed the power button on the remote and the TV did not turn on, thinking that because the cover was missing it was the batteries. I removed the batteries and put them back in but that did not work. I then tried to turn on the TV directly and still no power. After tracing the power cable I found that it was unplugged. The power cable would not reach the wall outlet so I plugged it in to the desk lamp on the counter next to the TV. Later that night I saw what looked like a roach crawling on the wall in the bathroom. The bathroom was the size of a small closet where the door had just enough clearance to open before hitting bathtub. There was maybe 3X4 floor space in the bathroom itself. The bed was extremely soft."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,2,Very disappointed in Days Inn,"I booked this hotel through a major web site. I was told I would get a king size bed, smoking room with refrig, microwave coffee maker. When I got there the man at the desk said I get a smoking room with 2 double beds, He said thats what the web site sent to them. I dont believe that, he wouldnt show me. So I had to take it. The elevator sounded like it was on its last leg. The carpets were filthy, no coffee maker, the mattresses and boxed springs must of been 10 yrs old very uncomfortable, even holes in the sides, pillows felt like shredded foam and to make matters worse, there were cob webs all up the walls and corners by the sink. The television was old in a huge coffin like tv stand, no channel guide, no dresser and no comfortable chairs. For a few dollars more I will go across the street next time."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,1,Worst Experience of my life.,I will not be using expedia ever again this Hotel was a dump and if this is what you guys deal with I don't want any part of it. I didn't stay I just lost my money because there was no refund so they said. so thanks for nothing.
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,5,"Fabulous Hotel, newly updated!","Everything was 5 star! Beautiful granite, exceptional bed and a quiet night."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,5,Can't wait to go back,"I'm very happy with that particular hotel! The room was very neat and clean, staff very friendly and willing to help in anyway possible. The frontdesk employee gets 10 out of 10 points for friendliness and service. It's convinient location will suit anyone nomatter if you're travelling for business or for pleasure. I would highly recommend Days Inn Glen Burnie to everyone who is looking to stretch their vacation dollar and yet have fun and comfort of a higher class hotel!"
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,2,Will Not Return,"I understand that this is an older hotel, but I would hope with the Days Inn name, it would be kept up better. The rooms are in drastic need of updating. The room was not as clean as one would expect, and the elevator was dirty. As far as the free breakfast....disappointing doesn't begin to express it. One guest advised one of the staff members that the hot food was not being kept at the required temperature (in fact, it was cold) and there was NOTHING done. The milk for the cereal was left in a pitcher on the counter to get warm. The staff that we encountered was pleasant, but it was not enough for my husband and I to stay there again."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,3,Not a great place,"This place needs updating. The room had a foul odor. Sink wasn't working properly. While we were away during the second day, the staff emptied out the refrigerator. Don't know why they did this as our stay was for 3 days. Completely unacceptable. Will not stay there again."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,4,great for students and pet lovers,"The staff was very helpful and even upgraded my room for free. They allow pets, they have hot free continental breakfast and the room was clean and comfortable. My only complaints was the noise of the other guest. You could clearly hear voices and televisions until late and there was a lot of people walking around outside the door of the room."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,1,Not Impressed,"I was lead to believe through your site that pets were welcome and no extra fee was charged, then when I got there they told me I had to pay x-amount a day but since the only person staying the next night was my grandmother and I would be leaving with my cat that was all I would be charged but then I was charged 2x more and they said there was nothing they could do about this. I even confronted the same person and asked why I was paying 2x more and that this was not what you told me the day before, he said he was sorry, but I was to pay 2x more. I will never go to Days Inn again, x amount a day is ridiculous."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,1,Ewww dirty.,"Made a mistake and walked on the carpet with barefeet,, umm flypaper, not quite. Unchanged sheets on 1 of the beds. Poorly cleaned bathroom. Felt dirty till i got home and showered."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,1,"Terrible hotel, small chance of getting stabbed.",The worst hotel stay I've ever had. On the positive side there was a hiphop chicken and fish next door...
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,2,Not the worst place to stay but had some issues,"We had two rooms for the weekend and we may have just been there on a bad weekend or something because we planned on leaving around 830 on sunday morning and upon waking up there was no hot water, one of the rooms air conditioning units had stopped working in the middle of the night and it was a humid evening, so we went to the continental breakfast to find no toaster and stale fruit loops. Hot water was available but not until about 1030 so we were about 3 hours behind schedule when all is said and done and we had to stop and grab some breakfast."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,4,Very satisfied for the money,"Clean, shopping near by, very pleasant staff, would stay here again"
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,4,"It's A Good Deal, Plain Simple","Great Rates. Convenient Location with plenty of restaurants. Safe Neighborhood. Clean and Comfortable Rooms. Very Friendly Staff. That about does it for a guy like me looking for a low frills travel bargain. Sure you could do better for bigger coin, but you could definitely do a whole lot worse. I've stayed there twice, and just like Arnold, I'll be back."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,4,snowflakes,very comfy just wished we had a couple more blankets for us.
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,5,Great Experience!,Great Stay! Staff was very helpful!
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,4,cheap with a great staff,room was huge- staff was extremely friendly- this used to be a holiday inn years ago
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,2,Needs Improvement,Better maid service
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,5,"Nice hotel, close to a lot of stores, restaurants,","Nice staff, good breakfast available. Rooms were nice and clean."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,1,Will Not Go Back Ever,"The maid never came to our room. I reported this to the front desk no clean towels, the bed was not made, trash not emptied, etc. Active smokers were outside on the balconies, which is the only way to get to the rooms, day and night. Spend a few extra dollars and find another place down the road."
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,2,Vacuum the carpets!,When we walked into our room we found bugs dead and alive in the room. When we searched further we found more dead bugs. They should do a better job of vacuuming the rooms including behind beds tv and fridge.
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,4,"Nice Hotel, Wack Conditions",Everything in the hotel was nice. The only thing about the king sized non-smoking room was the AC didn't work properly. When you put it on full blast it felt like its 70 degrees not 60 degrees. However overall everything was nice.
Days Inn Baltimore South/Glen Burnie,4,Great locatio,"Room was clean and spacious, when u walk in the lobby has a funny smell, but overall the hotel is great."
Holiday Inn Express Portland Se - Clackamas Area,5,Great hotel for visiting our children!,"Great room, breakfast . . . easy access to everything we were up to while visiting our children!"
Holiday Inn Express Portland Se - Clackamas Area,3,"Loud, stay lies","Loud all night view of river is actually a freeway, hotel does, not follow consumer policies has shown all of her website, all of the rooms all over Hotel, Instead they offer you a water bottle. Seriously"
Holiday Inn Express Portland Se - Clackamas Area,1,Worst management I've seen,I had a room reserved for me by the National Guard for july 15th and 16th. About 5:30 is when i showed up to the hotel on the evening of the 15th. I told the lady at the front desk that i had this reservation for tonight and that the national guard was the ones who had set it up... More
Holiday Inn Express Portland Se - Clackamas Area,5,Great stay,"Your standard Holiday Inn hotel. Wish the chain would remove some of the gimmicks and drop the price, but I get some people enjoy them. It was a pleasant stay, the workers at the desk were very helpful on telling how to get around town on the public transit system and were very kind. Breakfast is solid and there's plenty of room to eat. If we go back to Oregon, we'd consider staying here. Wish the Max went a little farther south closer to it, but that's not the hotel's fault."
Holiday Inn Express Portland Se - Clackamas Area,3,Convenient to highway,Some of the Front desk staff were knowledgeable others had very little information on the immediate area. When asked to recommend an Italian restaurant She had no idea. That was just one issue we had with front desk. Another complaint would be that the pool was so murky No one was using it.
Circa 39 Hotel,5,Great find in Mid-Beach!,"First, this place is super quaint and cute. Some of my biggest takeaways were: - Location was great, considering we had our 10 month old baby girl with us. No one treated us differently because we were there as a family. - Rooms were a little dim for me, but they were clean and decorated very nicely. - Loved the... More"
Circa 39 Hotel,5,Value stay in wonderful Miami Beach,"Excellent little hotel in a wonderful location with corteous and helpful staff in a very well kept facility. Stayed for two nights and really enjoyed it. Rita, a member of the staff, was particularly helpful."
Circa 39 Hotel,3,nice big and clean rooms - but noisy,"We have spent 3 nights at circa 39, the rooms are very spacious, nice and clean, the beds are very comfortable and big! Unfortunately our check in was super short, the guy at the front desk didnt explain anything, we had to ask where the room is, if breakfast is included, what time it is served, what the Wifi password...

Days Inn Columbus East,5,Two thumbs up,"Very clean and pleasant hotel. The noise level almost non existing, always a plus for me! The staff was very professional and catered to my needs without question. The banquet hall was very clean, a great size, well put together, and affordable. I will definitely be doing business with this location again. Thank you for providing me with a home... More"
Days Inn Columbus East,4,"Room is ok, lobby and lobby restoom room needs serious upgrade - Seen better days","I arrived way early on a sunday and since the check out time is noon, there were no rooms available.

Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,4,nice hotel poor customer service,I was bitten by something in the room and when I brought it to the attention of the staff it was minimized by general manager. Poor customer service when initially I wasn't asking for a refund or any compensation. I now will go to the doctor and have them tell them that they are some type of insect bites.
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,4,Two Minor Things,"The Hotel was beautiful, staff very nice, and clean rooms. However, we got really lost going into the city and the front desk person was not from the area and could not help us at all with directions. The other was that we got a not request 6 a.m. wake up call that scared the two of us, we thought it was an emergency and bolted up across the room to find out it was a mistake."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Outstanding Hotel at a great price!,"Very large room, restaraunts close to the hotel, room had everything needed, enough room for a family of 5 to be comfortable. Close to BWI and not far from Inner-Harbor, on time and courteous shuttle driver. Our family will return."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,2,Needs staff improvement,"When we arrived at the hotel at 4.30PM well past the check in time of 3 PM, the clerk told us that the room was not ready, could not tell how long it would be before the room would be ready. He did not explain why the room was not ready. His attitude was that it was that way and there was nothing he could do about it. We had to wait for over one hour and only when we approached the clerk and inisted on the room then only he procedded to give us a room. The next day we returned from a late breakfast at 12:05 pm and we were not able to get into our room as the card would not unlock the door."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,4,first time in Baltimore,"Really friendly staff. Room was very clean and comfortable. Only slightly negative thing to add, I had to wake up the sleeping overnite front desk personel when I was checking out in the morning!"
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Really cool place to stay,"Up to date hotel, consider carrying Starbucks coffee in the rooms, access to the business center was a plus and you had working printers too great amenity. I would stay here again"
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Friendly Staff,I enjoyed my recent stay and will stay here again next month when I return on business. I was especially pleased with the helpful front desk staff as well as the restaurant team. The breakfast each day was quite good as well.
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Property well maintained,"Well maintained facilities, courteous staff, as you expect in the Hilton chain. close proximity to BWI airport great weekend rate, at least that weekend."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,4,Great room for the money,for the money this is a very nice hotel. we only stayed one day so we didn't have to deal with cleaning service but the room was clean. only issue is the hours the pool is open. doesn't open till 5pm during the work week.
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,great hotel near BWI,staff most helpful. was able to check in much earlier and got room on top floor as requested. business room well equiped/
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Wonderful stay,Service was excellent
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,4,Great hotel for the price,"This was our first time in Baltimore, and the neighborhoods are hit or miss there. This was a pretty good part of town- not much there yet. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. The hotel had a smell to it though- there were smoking rooms I think- but the hallway was very musty. Everything looked clean though. The location must have been a newly developed area, there was not much right by the hotel- but it was convenient to hop on the interstate. All in all, we would stay here again"
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Great Experience,We attained this hotel at a great price. The room was comfortable and conveniently located. The gym and pool was a definate plus. We would choose this hotel again.
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,4,Convenient to the airport,Very pleasant experience. Comfortable room and clean conditions. Got a great rate for the night.
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,2,Poor Condition,The ceiling was dripping water onto my broken toilet. The place is in desperate need of renovations. It was clean as it could be for the condition it was in.
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,4,Great stay!,The room was great and the lady at the front desk very helpful and nice. Only main complaint was that it was very warm in the lobby area. Couldn't really relax because it was so much more warmer then the other floors.
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Wonderful location and staff,One of the best hotels I stayed. A++
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Lovely hotel!,It was lovely and relaxing. I will come again! Thanks
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Perfect!!,I finally found my go to hotel near BWI airport. I travel a lot through that airport and after bumming around I finally found the one!! Very clean hotel with the utmost courteous staff!
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,2,Not as good as the usual Hilton Garden Inn,"I stay in HGI all the time and usually it is reliably clean with very pleasant staff. Our room was fairly worn and not someplace you would want to walk barefoot. More than that, the staff weren't super helpful - stingy on the tiny shampoo bottles when I asked for more (I was traveling with 3 daughters with a lot of hair), refused to let us have breakfast even though we arrived before 10am (granted it was 9:55am but the full buffet was still sitting there). To top it off, the pool is only open at night on weekdays even though it was a holiday weekend Monday."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Nice Hotel,"This was a nive hotel. The bed was very confortable. the rooms were very clean, and it was nice that they had a wall thermostat to better regulate the rooms temperature. the HVAC was quiet and the staff was very helpful. The box spring was a bit worn though. I had use some pillows under the mattress to stop the feling of sleeping up side down. other than that it was a great stay"
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Excellent,This is a very nice place wit easy access to restaurants and the airport.
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,2,Bring your own towels and some bug spray,"Check in was quick. Room was clean. About 11pm we called to the front desk for a blanket. 15 minutes later, still not there. We called back to the front desk, to inquire as to the blankets location. We were then told they did not have available staff to bring it up. I went to the front desk to retrieve it. Surprise, 2 people at the desk. The next morning I called for some towels. 20 minutes later, called again. Another 20 minutes, we were sharing towels. They never showed. One of the adults in our party found bed bugs! I went down to the front desk and asked for a manager. He did not want to come out of his room, stating he didn't get back to his room until very late. After some insistance, he showed up. His answer was to give me a 10 gift card to Target. I like most of the Garden Inns we have stayed at. This one will never see me again."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Surprising,"The hotel was enjoyable, and everything was clean, and more than we expected.The pool was nice, plenty of towels, and a Life guard on duty. The rooms were clean, and the servic was excellent."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Nice hotel very comfortable rooms,"My family stayed overnite, the staff was friendly and very helpful, large cleen room."

Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Outstanding Hotel,"Outstanding Hotel. After spending the day at Inner Harbor, we spent the night at BWI's Hilton Garden Inn. The staff was very friendly and helped us find a good place to eat. The rooms were very comfortable and very clean. The whole hotel, itself, was very well maintained."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Nice hotel,Everything was great. Staff was friendly and helpful. They had no problem giving us a late checkout when we needed it. Overall great experience.
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Great location for BWI users,Everything was great. Breakfast was particularly yummy with made to order omelettes. Only room for improvement is to increase number of luggage carts available in the lobby.
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Great Airport Hotel,"I've stayed at this hotel before and was pleased when Hotels.com again offered it at such a reasonable price. The hotel van comes promptly to the airport, check in was speedy and the room was clean and welcoming. The one issue was that I arrived at the hotel tired in the middle of the afternoon and the pool did not open until 6 PM. I get that they mostly get traveling businessmen but having the pool available in the afternoons would be a great advantage to work off some sore muscles and traveling frustration. Hotel itself though is great."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Great,Great
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Great Price for Quality,"Very nice hotel, only complaint was that the pool is very small so if two families are in the pool it's overcrowded, but would definetly stay again."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,"Clean, Comfortable and Convenient","My stay was very short with actually only being a night sleep and catch an early flight however the room was clean and comfortable, the staff were friendly and helpful."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,My only real complaint,"We only had 2 wash rags and there were 3 occupants. The faucet on the shower was loose, so we had to be careful. The room itself was clean and was very cozy, especially since I was traveling with 2 small children. We will definitely stay there again."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Great room for the money,"Nice Room with good size flat screen TV. Resturant pricey and limited menu, food was good."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,No problem,"Clean, comfortable and quiet room, convenient shuttle to airport, AND they let me leave my car in their lot while I traveled. Good price, too. Perfect."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,3,"Good, not great",I love Hilton properties and I always choose one if it is available. This is not the nicest one I've ever stayed in. The smell of cleaning products was a little too pronounced. Things were a little dingy. But the bed was as comfortable as ever and the room was nice.
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Excellent Stay,From the moment I arrived I had the best experience. The hotel was located near several restarants that were within walking distance and the hotel even had room servicee. The room was clean and very spacious. Another bonus was that there was free parking for rental cars or if you drove your own car. Overall great service and if I go back to the area I will definitely look into staying there again!
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,4,"Great hotel, but isolated","Clean hotel, friendly service, but breakfast isn't included. This hotel is located outside BWI airport, which is great if you're flying out of BWI. But being about 10 or so miles outside Baltimore, it made it extremely inconvenient to get to downtown Baltimore from here. The light-rail train took us almost an hour from Penn Station, and that was just to get to BWI, not even to the area where all the hotels are. Really inconvenient without a car."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,4,close to airport,"All was fine, but there was an unpleasant odor in the comforters and new sheets which permeated the room."
Hilton Garden Inn BWI Airport,5,Excellent,Hotelxcellent H
Holiday Inn Express and Suites,4,Nice Hotel but noise from adjacent rooms are audible,"We stayed here one night along with 10 of our travelling companions. Most of our group complained that they could hear partying in rooms next to them. Reporting the noise to the desk did not solve the problem. There was a group of school kids in the hotel, the night we stayed there. The rooms are nice and well equipped... More"
Alamo Motel,3,Cute but meh,"I made a reservation through Expedia. I'd read an article saying that all the rooms had been refurbished, so I thought I was OK. A day before our stay I looked at the Alamo's web site, which advised that one needs to call the motel to get a refurbished room. I tried calling them over the course of 4 hours... More"
Howard Johnson Marina at Monterey Bay,4,Nice clean hotel for the price,"Great budget hotel with fridge, microwave, and free wifi. Free breakfast is good but no thrills. Owner is real nice. Great alternative to all the other high price hotels in the area if you need a basic clean place to stay."
Hampton Inn Orlando-Maingate South,4,Convenient stop off I-4,"We stayed here for one night after driving up from the Tampa airport to Orlando area to meet family that has already arrived. I found an amazing rate (under 100 total bill!) and it made the decision to stay here easy. The hotel is at Exit 55, right off of I-4 at US-27, about 7-12 miles from the I-4 Disney... More"
Hampton Inn Orlando-Maingate South,5,Thumbs up hotel and location,Excellent location - clean hotel - safe - friendly and helpful staff. We ve stayed twice this year - short driving distance to Disney parks. Great for family travel - breakfast and wifi included. Will stay again
The L.A. Hotel Downtown,5,Great find,"Very nice hotel. Rooms are quite comfortable. Donna at the front desk was super helpful and suggested many nearby restaurants. Hotel is centrally located. Lobby has a nice bar too. Will plan to come back.Greetings, Thank you for staying with us here at the L.A. Hotel Downtown. So happy to hear that we exceeded your expectations in every way during your stay. Can't wait to see you back with us.. Best Regards, The L.A. Hotel Downtown"
The L.A. Hotel Downtown,3,Great staff.. updated rooms.,My experience here was Ok. The staff was very welcoming and professional. The hotel is a bit dated. My bathroom was very small. in fact the bathroom was pretty lame....Given the price I will likely look elsewhere next time.
Best Western Dutch Valley Inn,5,Good place to stay,Great place to stay for the price. Newly remodeled and well maintained. Closeness to interstate is very good. Easy access with plenty of places to eat and shop. Quaint small town. Felt very safe staing there
Best Western Dutch Valley Inn,5,Best place to stay in New Philadelphia,"Everyone there is very friendly, accommodating and helpful. Hidden behind Holiday Inn, it's very much worth the stay. This is the 3rd or 4th time we have used this hotel and will continue to. Never had a problem here and continental breakfast offers a huge variety."
Best Western Dutch Valley Inn,4,They paid attention,"We stayed here and really enjoyed our stay. Nice rooms, clean although the carpet in the room we stayed in needs to be replaced. This hotel did pay attention to our special requests, which rarely happens and sometimes those little things make a BIG difference. We didn't try the breakfast but we will next time we stay here."
Best Western Dutch Valley Inn,5,We returned w/in a week,"This hotel is an easy on / off from the freeway. The hotel staff were polite and courteous. The rooms were quiet and comfortable. During both of our stays, we were the only ones using the pool and that was a bonus. The breakfast bar impressed us with the variety of options available. Definitely recommend this hotel!"
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,1,NEVER AGAIN,Never again! The rooms comforters were stained terribly and found hair on sheets. They gave us another room and it looked the same. You get what you pay for I guess. We left and drove to another hotel
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,5,Hampton mini vacay,It was great room was very nice n they treated me like a vip
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,1,Pay the extra money to stay somewhere else.,The picture on their web site is correct but everything else is garbage. The bathroom had what looked like blood on the curtains. There was people outside drinking alcohol and being loud despite the 40 degree weather with rain. The stairway up to the 3rd floor smelled like urine. Strongly recommend to pay the extra money and stay at a different hotel. Would not take family here.
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,1,Not worth 10.00,"Hair all over place, shower curtain rod broken and couldn't keep closed, water went all over floor, insense sticks sticking out vent and cover burnt, hair dryer didn't work, wrong insert for coffee non usable, room didn't get cleaned at all next day. Staff not knowledgeable at front desk, housekeeping was told to come to room and never showed. Maintenance did show and was ok but not the most interactive. Front desk no apologies given. 1 of our worst stays ever."
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,1,Hotel Nightmare,"Needs Improvement,Our room had a odor, the toliet leak, the room was not clean that well."
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,4,Home for now,The staff was very accommodating...very friendly. The beds are very comfy..I love being in the front I get to see everything around the hotel.
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,2,Definately Needs Improvement,"Check in staff did not smile or greet me. She just looked at me when I walked up to the counter. Housekeeping lady had an attitude and was rude. Did not bring washcloths, towels, or extra pillow that I requested. No one answered the phone when I called several times. There was no micro fridge or microwave as I expected and thought they stated. No iron or ironing board and they required to hold my husbands ID in order to use an iron. I will never stay at this hotel again!!!!!"
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,2,Would not stay here again,"Although the hotel is in a convenient location and was inexpensive, the housekeeping is not acceptable. Sheets were not changed. Towels were not replaced. Sink was not clean. In addition, there were sketchy people in the lobby and hanging around the premises. Did not feel safe or comfortable. Would not stay here again."
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,3,Not too bad,Was only there to shower before hitting the road back home but the rooms were nice and clean. There were minor flaws such as dings and dents here and there but other than that it was a basic hotel.
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,2,Dirty,Not going here again. No coffee dirty place and bad neighborhood
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,2,Messy and smelled of bleach,We came to the hotel and weree so.overwhelmed with the smell of bleach that our eyes and throats burned. The carpet was damp with the stuff and we couldn't even open the windows to open it up. There were hairs all over the bathroom and there was trash under the beds.
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,3,First visit was the charm,"I have visited this hotel twice now. On the first, I enjoyed a king-size bed and a clean room however, on my second visit to this hotel I found that the bedspread had a visible stain on it as soon as I entered the door. The towels which were meant to be white didn't appear to have been bleached at all, so they were dingy. On the floor leading to the bathroom was a red stain which I cringe to imagine what it consisted of. Overall, the room wasn't as clean as the one I enjoyed on the first visit."
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,4,Nice hotel nice ataff,The room had a funny smell and also dirt around the mirrors and stains on the sheets. The microwave also didn't work. Besides this it's a nice hotel And a great location. Oh and late check is only an extra 30 minutes not an hour.
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,3,Close to Hampton Coliseum,"I was happy to see the hotel was close to my destination. Disappointed, however, that there were spots on the bedspread and my travel companion found a dead bug on her pillow case. I asked her to call the front desk to tell them but she didn't want to. We also had to stop by the office to get a bath mat. I know I didn't pay a lot, but I would rather pay for peace of mind than to experience yuck."
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,4,Good for the value,It's too bad there's no continental breakfast. But the room was suprisingly comfortable for the price.
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,4,Good hotel for the price,Great location for the hotel could be updated a little bit but all in all we had a great time.... Hotel staff was excellent only complaint what have to be it needs to be updated
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,3,Not the best.,"Don't let the hotel pics fool you. The rooms are VERY small outdated. Save your money go across the street or even down the street for a better, not to mention safer stay. Pay the extra 10 or 20 go to Holiday Inn Express. Trust me."
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,2,Close to Coliseum,The temperature in the room was inconsistent. It was either to hot or to cold. The unit did not maintain the temperature I selected which was really uncomfortable at night while trying to sleep. The fabric shower curtain was dirty. It had stains and what appeared to be dried up shampoo with hair.
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,3,Use only in a pinch,"The room was adequate but not anything else. I stayed here because it was the only room I could get because of a Jazz Fest at the Hampton Coliseum. The rate was about 2.5 times the regular room rate definitely not worth the price, but I had no choice."
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,3,Poor customer service.,Check in service was slow. Personnel were rude. Smoking room was given to two non-smokers. Strong smell in room even with air conditioner running non-stop.
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,3,Convenience,It is not as well kept as the RRI BWI but it was very convenient to the Convention Ctr and restaurants.
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,1,sleep on the street is better,I would sleeep on the street rather than this Motel.
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,2,Not satisfied,Not very good. Room had many issues. I had a total of 3 rooms and there were problems in each room particularly mine. Hotel staff is not very friendly. Probably overworked due to the fact that one person does about 4 different jobs. Cannot and will not get the attention you need if there is a problem
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,2,Ok place to stay,"I stayed here for one night. I was not able to check in right at 3 pm so I had to leave and come back. The young lady at the front desk was pleasant enough. The room was decent, although the bath towels smelled like cigarette smoke. I did see the cleaning staff outside the rooms with their carts smoking cigarettes. At times some of the guest were a bit loud and you could here them, but it didn't bother me enough to complain. The location was good for where I needed to go. Ok place to stay for a night OR 2 but I wouldnt do more than that."
Red Roof Inn Hampton Coliseum Convention Center,2,Not again,The room was supposed to be a non smoking room yet the smell made it clear that previous patrons had smoked and more than just cigarettes. There was a cigarette burn on the wall above one of the beds. The overall condition of the room was disappointing especially when it cost 80.80 for a one night stay.
Comfort Suites,5,Great Just-in-time Getaway,"Perfect for a family of four on Chincoteague. Clean, friendly, well-appointed, convenient to everything. A no-hassle getaway for a holiday weekend."
Comfort Suites,4,Great staff,"Very helpful knowledgable staff. Great location, poor wifi."
Comfort Suites,4,Nice view of Sound side and comfortable lodging,A very nice Hotel with very friendly staff. The complimentary breakfast was ok but nothing great. The only problem we ran into was the indoor pool was being worked on so it was closed to us.
Comfort Suites,4,Close to tourist area,"Hotel was clean convenient. Staff was friendly. The view from our room was nice until we looked down saw a huge, ugly retaining pond."
Comfort Suites,5,great hotel reasonable price,What a pleasant surprise. All rooms have a great view and are clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. This hotel is a real value.

Comfort Suites,5,Comfort Suites was Wonderful!,"Wonderful staff, clean hotel, great location!"
Comfort Suites,3,Nice hotel with beautiful view,"Nice hotel with beautiful views. Business trip so unfortunately only stayed one night, but will definitely return."
Comfort Suites,5,Outstanding Hotel,"The Comfort Suite in chincoteague, VA had a sumptuous breakfast, with hot and cold choices, even fresh waffles daily. The room was large and comfortable, the housekeeping staff very on top of their work, and the front desk accomodating and available. The location is perfect - near enough to walk to the shops, near enough to Assateague for a quick beach drive. Lovely for children."
Comfort Suites,4,Great deal but room location reflected jt,"Hotel was wonderful. Location, staff, amenities, cleanliness were great. Loved the choice of pools. Two small issues:. Shower needs a grab bar to help older and/or mobility challenged guests in and out. A!so, the discounted rate was clearly reflected in our room location. Less than pleasant view, near hotel HVAC equipment which burped and gurgled 24/7, and door to room 5 steps from ice and vending machines."
Comfort Suites,5,"Comfortable, friendly staff, clean, near beach","Great, friendly service. Close to beach and great restaurants and art galleries. Comfortable room. We had a great time."
Comfort Suites,5,Awesome view of the Chincoteague channel,"Everything was wonderful, down to the sign, the balloons and chocolate bar in the room for the 2 birthdays we were celebrating. Great view of the Chincoteague channel, room was clean, staff was very courteous, breakfast buffet was extremely scrumptious. Overall very excellent stay in the middle of November!!"
Comfort Suites,5,"The Comfort Suites in Chincoteague, VA",The hotel is almost completely renovated. All rooms have bay view and no smoking. Room was comfortable with separate seating area and table/chairs. Like the idea of going green by requesting that visitors opt not to have sheets/towels changed everday. Will definitely return.
Comfort Suites,5,Beautiful vacation,"This hotel was perfect for a girls trip over labor day! For years we'd gone to Ocean City but this year we did not want to get overrun with labor day crowds and we happened to find Chincoteague. It was the perfect choice, even on labor day the traffic was minimal, it was quiet and the beach was not very crowded at all. The hotel is a short 10 minute drive from the beautiful beach so we could go any time. The room was very clean, updated, comfortable and spacious with a gorgeous view of the bay. Swimming in the outdoor pool overlooking the water makes you feel like you are on a tropical island. The staff is incredibly nice, helping us with directions and anything else we needed. It made a huge difference that we could pay a little extra and extend our checkout time to 7pm! We were able to have a whole extra day at the beach before having to pack up and go home, it was great! We are looking forward to our next vacation at the Comfort Suites!"
Comfort Suites,4,Nice place to overnight,Located between Nashville and Knoxville it was a nice place to stop overnight. Nice and clean and new. Plenty of near by restaurants and gas stations. Easy access to the highway. Hot breakfast.

McMenamins Kennedy School,4.6,loved the soaking pool.,Bad: There really needs to be a large shelf or small table in the bathroom to put stuff on. Good: loved the soaking pool.
McMenamins Kennedy School,5,"For a unique and delightful stay in a Portland neighborhood, try the Kennedy School Hotel.",Bad: Need higher wattage light bulbs in bedside lamps. Larger pillows for bed. Good: Like the character of the hotel. Unique. Nostalgic. Bars and restaurant are fun. Friendly staff. Good food. Reasonable prices.
McMenamins Kennedy School,5,Fabulous,"Bad: Nothing. Good: Pool, food/bars, enormous room, large bath room, gardens, staff"
McMenamins Kennedy School,5,"Charming, quiet, clean- friendly staff!","Bad: Pool crowded with local moms tots. Would love common gathering room, all designated common space is also used for meetings and were booked while we were there. Good: Charming, quiet, clean- friendly staff! Fun happy hours at tiny corner bars. Beautiful courtyard garden. Large fire pit out front."
McMenamins Kennedy School,5,great use of an old building!,"Our hotel staff recommended we check it out for the view and brew and we just loved it! Such a cool idea to re-use a character filled building! There's a little something for everyone there...we checked out a new movie for only 3 and enjoyed drinks and food while relaxing in comfy couches. Prices are very reasonable, and the atmosphere...

Hilton Garden Inn Myrtle Beach/Coastal Grand Mall,5,Excellent Service!,"We were pleasantly surprised with the Hilton Garden Inn.

Holiday Inn Express Suites Denver Sw-Littleton,4,Perfect Fit,Came in late and stayed one night for a concert at RedRocks. Close to the venue. Good view out the window of the foothills. Plenty of food options in the immediate vicinity.
Red Roof Inn Detroit - Southfield,1,Bed Bug Inn,"When I first pulled in the parking lot I seen furniture sitting outside of every room on the first floor, when I asked the front desk clerk about it he said they were remodeling. We found hair in the sheets so we asked the clerk for new sheets and he couldn't locate any. The next morning we went to front desk and the clerk told us tocall corporate. Later that night is when we discovered that we were actually being bitten by bed bugs not only were we bit we saw them with our own eyes I lifted the pillow from under my husband and seen one tiny bug,then I started to examine my daughters bed and I spotted a huge one."
Red Roof Inn Detroit - Southfield,4,Comfortable and affordable,This was a comfortable and affordable five night stay I was in Detroit for a business and I brought my family.

Honua Kai Resort Spa,3,Management asleep at the wheel,"We booked here for a second year in a row. We loved the first time around.

Honua Kai Resort Spa,2,Not a Hotel or Resort,"I'll start this review by saying that Honua Kai is not a Hotel or a Resort. It's amazing that they charge a 25.00 resort fee, because this place is merely a Condominium Complex. I've read the numerous other reviews on this place, and most of them are spot on. The rooms are nice, because they are new, but everything else... More"

Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,Best Hotel for Families,"We had another excellent vacation at Honua Kai. I looked around at the competitors - Westin / Sheraton / Marriott, but renting a Honua Kai condo through VRBO is still a considerable savings. It's a little further away from the action around Whalers' Village but we really didn't want to spend much time doing that anyways. There is a shuttle... More"
Honua Kai Resort Spa,4,Best value in the high end condo rental market by far.,"We (family of 4 including two older teenagers) love Maui and have stayed at several hotels and Villas on the northwest coast. We thought the Westin Villas were the very best until this current trip. The Honua Kai is now 1 in our book for several reasons: 1) Big, comfortable and well appointed units. We had a 2 bedroom with... More"
Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,Thumbs Up,"We stayed at Konea tower facing the beach. The amenities provided by this resort was great from full kitchen, Bosch dishwasher, washer and dryer furnished with detergent everyday. Great for couples and especially families.

Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,An incredible place that made my vacation unforgettable.,The resort was one of the most gorgeous places I have ever stayed at. Everything about the place was top-notch.

Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,Beautiful property,"Went here with the family in June of 2011. It's a beautiful hotel with lots of nice touches in the rooms: AC, ceiling fans, glass accordion doors that open to the lanai, full kitchen and washer/dryer. The kids enjoyed swimming in many pools and the great snorkeling on the beach. We chose a mountain view room to save on costs... More"
Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,Excellent Resort,My wife fell in love with this resort the moment she entered the room. The view was gorgeous and the resort was kid friendly. The kitchen was nice and clean so was the laundry room. We wished we could stay longer than we planed.
Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,Awesome!,Awesome resort! We are always pleased with the staff and the rooms. One of the best resort beaches in Lahaina. Great beach entry for kids and the pool has plenty to keep the kids happy. We have stayed at this resort 4 times and will continue in the future.
Honua Kai Resort Spa,4,"Great hotel, but a little removed","This is a condominium hotel that was built for sale purposes. As such, it is a much larger and superior accomodation ( several rooms) that would be found at other resorts. The hotel, grounds and staff were all excellent. There are a few minor downsides to this property in my opinion. First, it is a little distant from the other... More"

We were fortunate to have a week of great weather... More
Honua Kai Resort Spa,4,11 days was not enough,We really enjoyed our stay and loved the location as it was close to everything yet apart enough to have room on the beach and in the water.

Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,Honeymoon Perfection,"Honua Kai was the perfect place for our honeymoon! Located along the coast, Honua Kai had both the ambiance of the ocean and the view of the mountains.

Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,Loved this resort!!!,"We stayed here in April and fell in love with the property.

Beautiful trails to walk or run on along the beach. Great staff."
Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,Excellent Relaxed Honeymoon,"If you are looking for the resort feel where you are pampered day and night then this place may not be for you.

Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,My honeymoon,"Spent my honeymoon here, well one week of it. What a great place. Very much like a condo, they have barbq for you to use The restaurant, The Duke, is really good, but a bit pricey. Rooms are big and well worth the money."
Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,Honua Kai - Our Family's Favourite Destination,"We have stayed here twice in the last two years for 13 and 15 days respectively. Awesome location and facilities.

Honua Kai Resort Spa,3,Little disappointed,"I had big expectations after reading all the reviews. We booked a one bedroom, mountain view (Hokulani building room 524) via VRBO directly with an owner - Phoenix - she was helpful throughout the booking process.

Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,Perfect resort for all ages in perfect location and great pool staff,"We have now stayed at Honua Kai twice and both times have been fabulous.

It's soooo kid friends with a 1/2 foot pool for... More"
Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,Great,The rooms were brand new with huge balconies. A glass wall opened to the balcony so that the room was fully open to the outside.

Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,We would return to stay at Honua Kai,We rented out a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom mountain facing condo at Honua Kai through a real estate agent we found on one of those websites (VRBO) where condo owners list their condos for vacation rentals. It worked out to be about 40-50 off Honua Kai's rack rate. We didn't receive cleaning services everyday just when we moved in and... More
Honua Kai Resort Spa,5,Another great stay in paradise!,"We stayed at the Honua Kai in 2012 and although it has increased in price significantly it is still an amazing place. Went through VBRO and rented which was cheaper than on the hotel site. Really not a bad room the sun rises over the mountains and sets right out front. It has everything you need beautiful pools, well cleaned,... More"
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,4,Very pleased.,We really enjoyed our stay. There was nothing to complain about. The suite was exceptionally clean.
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Great room for the money,"If you're visiting the beach stay here!! I'm a former local and know all about the excessive noise and confusion on the oceanfront. Stay at this lovely, quiet bay front hotel and drive to the craziness of the oceanfront when you want to go down there. Park in the municipal lot on Pacific and 19th street and you're in the heart of the tourist area. Take you own bikes and simply ride all over the boardwalk....then go back to a quiet comfortable relaxing hotel room."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Excellent,Love it.
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,4,Decent Rooms at a Decent Price,"We stayed here because we needed a room that would sleep 6 people at a decent price. Upon arrival, the front desk staff were friendly...even though they tried to charge my card twice. They were always willing to help whenever the need arose though. The housekeeping staff were quite the contrary. If you needed anything outside the ordinary, they seemed bothered or afraid they were going to get in trouble from management. The room was dated but was comfortable. All ammenities worked as advertised and the room was similar to the pictures. The restaurant (Tradewinds) provided above average food at an affordable price. The pool was large enough for a large number of people but wasn't cleaned during our stay. (4 Days) It was open 24 hours though, which was nice as we arrived late the first night and did activities during the day/evening. Being off of the boardwalk provided a quiet experience which was nice. Also, there is a Food Lion directly across the street which we used to stock our cabinets and refrigerator. The beach was clean and also had a lit volleyball court after dark. My overall experience is as title states."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,3,Weekend getaway with wife and kids,"The hotel has seen better days. The room was adequate and clean, but nothing to rave about. The indoor pool was very cold despite being heated. My son and I could only stay in for about 20 minutes. We were on the 6th floor and it had a peculiar smell in the hallways that suggested they might be renovating on that floor...it was that chemical smell...of new carpet or glue...not sure. Our room service dishes stayed in the hallway one full day and night after we finished with them.... Overall...probably won't go back, it was just so-so"
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,great hotel,"Staff were very nice and helpful, set up golf trips, got directions, provided shuttle etc. Clean rooms, nice pool,nice restaurant. hot tub is kind of small and if wanting to swim in ocean a lot, might want to stay on va beach instead of bay, but not very far away if dont mind drive."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Great room for the money,"The Hotel was very clean hospitable. The entire staff was very couteous and prompt in responses to my needs during my stay. I would like to suggest that this particular Hotel whose location is right on the oceanfront, perhaps offer specials or services geared more towards romantic getaways."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Price a little high,"Overall the hotel is ok, except we had to ride for about 30-45 mins to find a decent resturant because the one that was located at the hotel was closed due to a family reunion. Because of the convienence of the resturant was part of the reason why i stayed and once we got there and they said that someone had reserved it we were very disappointed."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,3,Quick getaway to the beach,"The beds, pillows and linens were fine. The A/C and other pipe noises were loud and you could hear everything going on in the hallway. The tub filled from a shower and took forever to drain. Furniture is worn and dated. Beach was great and so was the pool. For the price and since we knew we wouldn't be in the room much, it was okay but next trip to Virginia Beach we'll try a different place."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,3,"Nice staff and view, weird problems","Spacious rooms, a lovely bay view and a reasonable price, but there were enough weird things that I won't be back. I did also appreciate the warm indoor pool for my winter visit. Weird things: -The light switch just inside my door did nothing, so I had to cross the room in the dark to turn on a light. -Door to the deck didn't actually latch shut, but at least it had a lock chain like on front doors. -Room keys both stopped working...twice...and had to be reset. -Elevators sometimes reopened immediately after shutting for no reason, had to hit door close again. Or were summoned to the floor I was waiting on, then didn't open. Had to 'summon' the elevator again for the door to open."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Everything was fine!,All as expected!
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Great hotel with a nice not so crowded beach.,"The hotel staff were very helpful and courteous. The room was clean and had plenty of room for our family of 4. Not immediately in the highly commercial area which we loved. The beach on the Chesapeake Bay wasn't extremely crowded which was a bonus. They have very nice hotel ammenities including an indoor outdoor pool, hot tub, semi private beach, water activities, kids camps, etc. We had the opportunity to hear a live band in the restaurant too. Food Lion right across the street and only a short drive to the more commercialized area. We loved it and would definitely stay there again."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,2,"Not bad, but strange.","The public areas of this property are relatively well maintained, and the staff there are friendly and efficient. Oddities: 1. The layout of the room--The beds were very close to the door, so it was impossible to ignore the noise in the hallway that went on all night. 2. Housekeepers expected to clean the room while we were in it. 3. Hotel staff knocked on the door at 10pm, and insisted on entering the room to exchange a new phone book for the old one in the room, even though we told them the children were sleeping. Very strange."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,3,Virginia Beach Resort Hotel,"Decent , Hotel needs to be updated."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Oustanding Hotel!!,"We were looking for a quiet retreat and we found it! Our suite had a partial waterfront view that was sublime! The decor was wonderful, and we enjoyed cooking for ourselves, although we did treat ourselves to their fabulous restaurant! We even stayed an extra day! This was our best stay in Virginia Beach, and we will be back soon!!"
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,3,Quick VA Beach getaway,Hotel is outdated but very comfy. Good price and was offered an upgrade free of charge. Had a view and direct access to the bay/beach.
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,4,It was relaxing,Overall the stay was very good. The shuttle service was very helpful and the drivers were friendly and gave us good information on where to eat or have fun. The pool was relaxing and clean although the hot tub was way too hot. The pool has an adult time after 11:00pm but it is not monitored so the pool and hot tub had kids (both from and not from the hotel) in it at that time. Get to the pool early to get a seat as there are not many and they go fast. It was nice to use the bikes for a ride since they are free for the first 3 hours. I would return to the Hotel in the future.
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,3,Hotel bien situe et belle plage.,"Un peu decu de l'hotel, le batiment a manque d'entretien au fil des annees et serait du pour une re-decoration majeure ( il semble que ce serait commence mais nous avons rien vu de cela). le personnels semblent souvent depasse mais est toujours tres sympathique et serviable."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Very nice hotel on the bay,Staff very friendly and helpful. Room was great! Can't wait to come back!
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Virginia Beach Conference Center,"Outstanding hotel, location not as convenient as I remembered with respect to fast food restaurants for that quick bite to eat. Very quiet area (well, it is dead of winter), but just the same we enjoyed the peace and quiet."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,2,Don't think we'll be returning.,"We were not impressed with this hotel. When we reached our floor, it smelled like mold. The rooms were outdated and the bed was extremely uncomfortable. You could hear EVERYTHING coming from the hallway, so it was extremely loud. On the good side, it was a bonus that the beach was not crowded and that the rooms were very big."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,4,Nice view of beach!,"We enjoyed this hotel and would stay here again, great room for families!"
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,3,"Hotel is okay, except . . . .","I found the hotel very nice. The rooms were clean, the hallways were clean and there was not a lot of noise. The beach is 'yucky', but the pool, the gym and the jacuzzi were very nice. If you eat at the TradeWinds restaurant, don't order the crab cakes. I'm still trying to decide what they tasted like. It certainly was not like a crab cake. Unfortunately, the hotel lost a customer for meals for the next 3 days, as we did not want to chance another food diaster."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Just a get away,Great the room was very nice n clean . We want to get away for day at beach. Wish had stay longer.
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,4,Beach Get Away!,"We enjoyed the Spa , pool , Beach and Location. We enjoyed Watching The Kids in Summer Camp For Sailing and other activities!"
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Me encantaron mis vacaciones pasarlas en ese lugar,Los cuartos muy limpios la limpieza en la alberca eso me gusto mucho todos los dias la limpian y le dedican tiempo a q quede todo bien eso se aprecia
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Great time!,"We had an outstanding time here, right near the beach and minutes from the Boardwalk. We would recommend this hotel to anyone"
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,3,Good location,"The hotel is in a good location and works well for families with the kitchen set-up. Noisy on a Saturday night after events/parties,etc."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,3,Aging hotel that could use a facelift,"Arrived early to combat traffic. Despite knowing that check-in was 4 pm, I asked that morning about the possibility of an early check-in and was told absolutely not. I returned about 3 pm to find many people checking in ahead of the 4pm deadline I was given. The carpets are worn and aging rapidly, the walls need a new coat of paint desperately. The staff was pleasant if not a little understaffed. It was a holiday weekend but this hotel is not worth the premiums they are charging."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,4,Enjoyed,"Truly enjoyed my stay. People were friendly, late check out, Sunday Brunch was great, room was cozy (carpet a little dirty), view to ocean was excellent."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,4,Simply Satisfied,"I enjoyed my stay at this apartment(even though they were still renovating). The place was very nice,spacious and you didn't feel as though you were bumping heads with others in the apartment. It was like a home away from home."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,1,DO NOT stay in this disgusting hotel,"I stayed here with my mother and niece. Upon arrival, I found a USED CONDOM on the floor. I went to the front desk who told me they were sorry in a non apologetic tone, but did not offer me a new room nor to come pick it up or any money off my hotel room. The room was dirty, the bed was very uncomfortable. In the morning when I went to check out I waited for the woman to get off the phone before a rude man busted in front of me and asked to be checked out. The woman at the front desk did not tell him I was next in line and she SERVED him FIRST despite me waiting there. I will never go back here nor will I reccomend it. It's disgusting."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,1,Great Hotel - Unless You Plan on Sleeping at Night,"The hotel was obviously last decorated in the 1980s. It is definately NOT A RESORT! The work-out center was dirty. The pool was much smaller than the 1980s brochures depicted. The brochure shows someone sitting on the island. There is a sign indicating that you must stay off of the island. There is a young girl in a raft in the swimming pool on the brochure also. That is laughable! A female bartender (description: Caucasian w/ longer brown hair-sorry, all I've got) was EXTREMELY RUDE during EVERY INTERACTION! The comforter had a blood stain on the side that sat on the pillows. The outside of the balcony door was completely rusted. The room door was paper- thin. We heard every normal volume conversation that went on outside of the room including the ones that occurred at 3 a.m. Truly, we were awakened several times during each night, just by conversations occuring in the hallway. The noise level was by far, the worst part of the stay. We got very little sleep."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,3,okay for the event,good
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,4,Great Hotel for Families and Conventions,"We have come to this hotel yearly for 23 years. It's convenient, friendly and has above average amenities. We recommend it especially for families. All rooms are two room suites which gives parents an opportunity to separate awhile from children. All rooms have a view of the Chesapeake Bay and balconies."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,2,Not Impressed,"The location is nice as well as the hotel staff, but is not a good place to stay if you need to get any sleep at night. I stayed there twice and both times I had to call down to the front desk and have security come up and investigate noise issues. Guests seemed to congregate in the hallways creating lots of noise into the wee hours of the mornings."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,4,Need better customer service!,The front desk supervisor/manager was rude and not helpful at all. I asked for extra towels 3 times and never got them. The elevator took 10 minutes to come.
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,3,Alright for the discounted price we paid,"My second cousin was getting married on the beach a short walk from this hotel, so I was very happy to find this place at a discounted price on the week of the trip. The hotel was fine overall but there were some small things that bugged me: * The beds were squeaky * The towels were scratchy * Some machinery within a locked area in the bathroom was running and making a lot of noise RIGHT next to the wall between the bathroom and the bedroom, next to the bed where my wife and I slept. It didn't keep me up at night, but it was noticeable. Some good things to make sure you don't think it was all bad: *The hotel's restaurant, Tradewinds, had great food, and it provided good room service AND it was the first time I'd seen room service at a reasonable price. *The hotel is right on the beach, and since it's not in the crowded part of VA beach shore, there's not so many other people to deal with. Also, the hotel is on the shore of VB that is in the Chesapeake Bay, so the water is much calmer than the beach along Atlantic Avenue something to consider if you have young children."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,4,Beach location,"The room was okay, but we kept having lighting problems. Enjoyed the location, great beach location. Tradewinds, the restaurant, was slow service."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,"The only place I would stay, when I go to Virginia Beach !","Some years ago,my father in-law selected this hotel and we had a great time. After he stopped going the rest of us went down again but stayed somewhere else. Big mistake ,so this time it was without question as to where we were going. This will be our spot every year for a week. The people are great as well."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,3,Not how to renovate and stay open for business,"The primary complaint was the inability to enjoy the pool and the beach, because work renovations were going on that left a steady snow like shower of Styrofoam sprinkles that blew over everything and coated the pool. It would seem that some type of netting could have been installed to have prevented this. Hotel patrons had to vacate both indoor and outdoor pools for staff to attempt to clean up the residue and of course there was no sunbathing to be had under the circumstances. So much for our ONE beach day."
Virginia Beach Resort Hotel Conference Center,5,Cheer Competition,I was very very pleased.
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,3,I expected better,My daughter and I just needed a room for the night on our way home from Pennsylvania. The free shuttle was very convenient.
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Great experience,"We arrived at almost midnight after a long day of flying in from out of the country. The staff member who checked us in was so pleasant and helpful and even gave us 2 complimentary bottles of water. The hotel was clean, beds comfortable, and a great location to BWI. We would definitely recommend the Hilton."
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,4,Staff after hours,Had a good stay until a disturbance broke out across from my room at 2 in the morning. No one cared enough to address the issue the couple across the hall were having even after it was reported several times. The altercation ended after they kicked my door several times and I informed them of what would be in store if this behavior continued. I spoke to the front desk and they cared enough to offer me a free cup of coffee. Embassy Suites.........
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,4,"Nice hotel, great food",Restaurant food was excellent. I hated to pay the 9.95 extra for the Internet per night
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,The hotel staff bent over backwards!,"I worked a conference here video documenting the workshops. i came in late on Thursday, and didn't have the best exoerience at the bar, but they were trying to close. The next morning, the breakfast buffet was really good for 14.95. The place is older, but well maintained. The shuttle service was great. They took me to the very convenient light rail and to a restaurant. The A/V crew was also really good and respobsive."
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,My Stay,"Everything from the staff, my room and the dining area was fabulous. The rates were great and I would recommend to anyone staying in the Baltimor area to stay at the Hilton"
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Great Place to Relax,Very new. Very clean. I recommend staying there if visiting Baltimore or the surrounding area. It was a 10-15 minute drive to Baltimore from the hotel. Great price per night. The neighborhood is all hotels with a Wendy's and Bob Evans near by. I'll stay here next time I'm in the area.
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,3,Not Impressed,"The bed was very comfortable, however the iron did not work properly and water seeped out of the bottom of the iron. Water drained from the bottom of the shower and I had to put towels on the floor around the shower to prevent falling. The room was dusty, the colors in the room were not inviting or appealing. I think a complimentary brunch would have been nice. If you are going to put coffee makers in the rooms at least give the customer something to stir the hot coffee."
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Just Lovely,Just wonderful
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Nice hotel. The kids really enjoyed themselves.,Stay overnight to enjoy time at the Baseball Museum and Stadium. Hotel very convenient to a lot of restaurants. Hotel staff were very informational. Hotel were very precise and peaceful in spite of multiple weddings. Would definitely like to go back. Thanks.
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,1,Double booked room,Everything went well till about 130 am when we were woke from a peaceful sleep of someone trying to enter our room. I went to the door to find another couple who told me we were in their room. Apparently the front desk booked our room twice. We never were able to get back to sleep which was a major problem as I was there for surgery the next morning at John Hopkins. My wife was given a free breakfast ( I was unable to eat due to the surgery) and we were told we would receive a free voucher for a free night in the the future in the mail. As of the writing of this we still have not received anything that was promised. This hotel was the BWI Hilton.
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,4,Hotel nice - Restaurant so-so,The food at the Aqua restaurant was WAY over priced. 50.00 for 3 people for a buffet breakfast
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Simply the Best!,This hotel is the best experience I have had with any hotel in quite some time. The staff was first rate and they treated you as a true guest. The food was outstanding and everything was calm and respectfully. I encourage any business traveler to choose this hotel if you are staying in the Linthicum Heights area!
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Loved my stay,"From the beginning to the end of my stay, the hotel staff was extremely accommodating. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone."
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Excellent atmosphere and business amenities,"The staff was excellent personable and very helpful. The hotel is top quality, flat screen TV, internet connectivity, and just 3 months old at the time I visited."
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,2,Cheap hotel,The staff was not at the desk and when they finally came out ignored me and took another person in front of me. When it was time to check out they couldn't print me a receipt and said they would email me but never did.
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,4,There for a conference,"Hotel was good overall. Good was okay. Desk staff, waitresses and bartenders were great. Would recommend it to a friend"
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Close to the airport,I was stranded in Baltimore for the night and needed a hotel near the airport. I reserved a room and called for a pickup. They were there within minutes and I was at the hotel in 5 minutes.
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,3,"Nice hotel, close to airport.",The hotel staff convey professionalism with the hotel guests. Rooms very clean. The chair in the room needs to be updated and the elevator carpets need spot cleaning or be replaced.
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Great for short term visit,"Very clean, relatively new hotel. Flat-screen tv's in rooms and great restaurant on ground level. Highly recommended for business travelers. If you are looking to really enjoy Baltimore and relax, this may not be the hotel for you. You will end up spending a lot of for cab rides."
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,3,Bad experience!,"This was a weekend get away for my husband's birthday. When we first arrived, the receptionist was pleasant but screwed up my information. Kept telling me that my credit card had declined I had booked through another travel company when I clearly showed her my reservation status verified that my credit card was in good standing. She then, goes get a manager who had gotten everything taken care of but didn't apologize on their end. After going through that (holding up the line because she was the only one working) she then tells us that the computer was down so she couldn't issue us room keys. We asked what were we supposed to do She said that she would send house keeping to out floor to let us in. House keeping even struggled to get in had to get another person to open the door. Finally, enter the room checked it thoroughly. Room was dusty bathroom sink was clogged when I washed my hands. Take a shower later on, and water leaked all over bathroom floor. Checked back 3 hours later for the room keys she told us the machine was still down so we had to wait an additional hour or so. Upon check out the next morning, a different young lady ask how was our stay, I explained briefly our experience. She then tried to cover up for the hotel saying Oh, it's just that the building is older and gave us a free breakfast ticket which the food was nasty Luke warm (NOT HOT). Very disappointed! Will not be staying here again."
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Airport Proximity,"I just needed to crash before an early morning flight. The airport shuttle service was fast and courteous, the hotel bar was relaxing for a nightcap, and the room had everything I needed, including a quiet night."
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,4,OK overnight stay.,One night stay near BWI airport which was fine for what it was.
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Great Hotel,The Hilton BWI was wonderful. We were greeted by staff that was friendly and helpful. The room was absolutely great. I was shocked by the 42 in Plasma TV with HD programming. The service was excellent. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as the price is right. I will be staying there with my wife again.
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Convient to Airport with shuttle,Very nice hotel with many conveniences. We selected because they provide a shuttle to the airport and downtown. We were able to stay without having to rent a car.
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,4,Overall an enjoyable stay,"We enjoyed our stay at this establishment. The king size room was very comfortable, the bedding and mattress type in particular. One aspect of the room that I thoroughly appreciated was the ability to control the climate. In many hotels the thermostats are locked out at a certain temperature depending upon the time of the year. At this hotel you could control the cool air or heat at your discretion (major kudos...). Unfortunately a complaint was lodged with housekeeping because a specific request was made to have the sheets changed (on second day of 3 night stay), and although the request was eagerly granted, the bed linen was not changed. Upon a late return to the hotel we made another request to have the bed linen changed. The service desk accommodated us as best as they could (at 1130p) but our sheets did not get changed until 1245a when the overnight attendant came on duty. This all could have been avoided had the housekeeping receptionist paid actual attention to my request instead of merely giving me lip service. The hotel manager took excellent steps in addressing my concerns. I would definitely stay at this hotel upon future travel. Thank You!"
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,4,Very Confortable,Very good hotel to stay
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,"Luxury, quality service at an affordable rate.","This was my second time staying at this hotel, and each time the hotel staff has been accommodating, the rooms are large, and the decor is fresh, updated. This is my go to hotel when I need a place to stay that's close to BWI airport."
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,"Nice hotel, convenient to BWI","We booked in here due to an early morning flight. It was a little more expensive than what we usually pay for when staying at a hotel but it was definitely worth it. Very lovely clean room, and the staff were very helpful and polite. The only downside was (upon checking out) the early morning shuttle driver was running a little late, and due to the amount of people and luggage, was stressed and became rude when trying to squeeze the last few people on the shuttle......however the shuttle driver the day before was very friendly and helpful so it all evened itself out."
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,3,No parking if they are busy!,"The point of us staying at this hotel was to have safe parking and use their shuttle service to get us to light rail and into the city. The shuttle only was available every half hour, and was full most of the time. We still ended up having to drive into the inner harbor and pay for parking. Not to mention that the hotel booked 4 wedding on one day. All of the wedding guests parked in the parking lot of the Hilton as well as the adjacent hotel, and we circled for hours trying to find parking to no avail. We had to park down the street and hope we didn't get towed. I had gone to the front desk to alert them of the issue. They couldn't be bothered with my issue. However, other guests stated that they were offered free valet, but then had to tip for the service. Definitely not worth the price considering it's no better than a Hampton Inn or something similar in a lower price range. Some of the desk personnel were lovely to deal with, but one in particular was irritated if you spoke to her."
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Excelente hotel,"Excelente, lo recomiendo al 100 y esta muy cerca del aeropuerto"
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,5,Nicer than I am used to for the price,I was surprised to find a newer Hilton at such a reasonable price. I thought there would be a catch though it turned out it was just a good find. Very nice.
Hilton Baltimore BWI Airport,4,A touch of class near BWI,"This is a well equipped, stylish hotel near the airport. Recommended!"
Staybridge Suites Lincoln Northeast,4,"Nice hotel, clean, safe and quiet",This hotel is a great place to stay. We were passing through town and needed to board our friends horses at a nearby stable. We were greeted warmly by Heidi at the front desk and she even gave our dogs some treats! Our rooms were immaculate. The hotel is walking distance to some restaurants as well. The rest of the...

Staybridge Suites Lincoln Northeast,5,My stay at Staybridge Suites,"I stayed a Staybridge Suites Lincoln North for a month while my new house was being completed.

The staff, especially Lucas and Vita, were so friendly and... More"
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Weekend getaway,"Excellent hotel, very easy to get to Little Italy. Was a weekend getaway so perfect setting."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Great lil get away!!!,Great getaway!! Will stay again!!
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Great hotel if you don't care about the pool,"The hotel was awesome. We even got to see the Bones, Thugs and Harmony entourage. :P The only downside is that the pool was a little gross and murky. My son didn't care but I wouldn't step foot in there. It was tough to see the bottom. Unfortunately part of my search criteria for a Baltimore hotel was if it had a pool."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Business Stay. One night. Perfect.,This was a great hotel. Everything was brand new and clean. Friendly staff. Great location. I would highly recommend.
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Nice hotel,Very clean nice hotel. Within a 15 minute walk to the inner harbor attractions. Room was very clean. Indoor pool nice but small. Complimentary breakfast was good. Nice hotel close enough to inner harbor great price.
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Easy stay,"seamless, clean, friendly stay in a good location just off the water in Harbor east. nice morning breakfast. Nice premium hotel in a convenient area."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Really good hotel for the money. Would recommend,"Great hotel for price. Large rooms with good views. We had small toddler and he had room to play and climb--very spacious! Room was very clean and hotel staff was great. Nice breakfast (eggs, waffles, French toast, fruit, yogurt). Everything was great, but the pool. Pool was extremely small and was greenish in color. I was surprised at how small it was. Other than that, great hotel for the money and it is close to the inner harbor and National Aquarium. Don't valet, as they charge 42 per day. Garage behind hotel was 3 on the weekend and we parked there 20+ hours. During week it was only 14 to park overnight."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Strange beginnings,"When we 1st arrived the staff was extremely friendly. The check in was swift as far as check ins go but they checked us in to an already occupied room. OMG! Can you imagine entering your room family in tow and there is someone sleeping in the bed. I was frighten, embarrassed and angry. We returned downstairs and the couple was already calling down about the intrusion. The staff apologized profusely and immediately gave us an empty room. Needless to say I had a hard time sleeping that night worried that someone might walk into our room but that never happened. The rest of the stay was worry free. The only other issue was the breakfast time. Breakfast at the Hyatt Place was from 6:30am-9am. That's awful early for people traveling with kids or on vacation. I'd like to take a moment to thank the staff. They were courteous and friendly especially Rosalind and Adriel. Thank you for a nice stay."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Fun filled 36 hours,"I recommend it for a quick, couples getaway, walk the area, lots of restaurants, taverns, and live music."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Stayed the last weekend in February,"Upon arrival we were greeted at the check in desk. He was very friendly and didn't waste anytime getting us on our way. We stayed on the 7th floor. The room was more like a suite. It had a king size bed and a sitting area that converted to a bed as well. The window overlooked the harbor in the distance and had a ceiling to floor window. Very modern room and hotel. Our room had a door, that conjoined to the neighboring room...this was the only flaw. I'm unsure if it was because of the conjoining door or thin walls, but we could hear everything they said and was a bit uneasy knowing they could hear us too. The hotel offers a continental breakfast. It was mediocre, like they all are. The setup was very nice and very clean. We didn't park at the hotel, 35 a night, instead we parked at the rear of the hotel. It was 3 a night in the public parking garage. This hotel is walking distance to Fells Point, Harbor East, Little Italy, and Inner Harbor. It is also under a 10 cab ride to Power Plant."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Very nice hotel.,Lovely hotel. The pool is small but was lots of fun for the young kids with us. The lifeguard was fantastic and gave the boys lots of toys to play with. Even in the cold everywhere we wanted to go was walking distance. We'll definitely stay here again.
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Access to johns Hopkins,Drs appt at jhh. Shuttle convenient. Breakfast good.
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,I am a patient at John Hopkins,"Excellent service, great size rooms and great location for my family to stay while I had surgery."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Convenient to Harbour,Very nice and modern hotel. Nice complimentary breakfast. Nice size rooms with separate couch area. Very friendly staff. Easy to walk to restaurants and Inner Harbour and Fells Landing. Convenient parking.
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Nice hotel clues to John Hopkins and Fells Point,"Hotel, clean, friendly lots of restaurants nearby. Atmosphere homey."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Nice hotel close to wedding venue,"Upon arrival, we were welcomed courteously. The receptionist gave us a corner room with a convertible sofa bed. The extra space gave us plenty of room to place all the things needed for the wedding. The daily breakfast which were delicious was very convenient to start our daily activities. The housekeeping staff were very accommodating and courteous and helpful. The security staff were always present near the front door and very welcoming"
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Great Stay!,"We loved the Hyatt Place Baltimore! Harbor East is a fantastic neighborhood, full of shopping and great restaurants. It is convenient walk to the bay and to Fell's Point. The rooms are very nice and the staff were very courteous. Thank you for a great long weekend!"
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,2,"Bad hotel, bad location, just bad","First off there is no parking, valet is your only option which would be fine if it were a better hotel. Our AC didn't work, maintenance had to come reset it three times. Very inconvenient at 8pm, 11pm then again at 1am. The pool is a joke, it's more like a bathtub. And the amazing breakfast they advertise is no better than a Continental at most hotels. Over all it was a huge disappointment."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,"Business Trip, related to JH hospital area visits.","What's really unpleasing is that the hotel has no windows that can be opened and the air conditioning system has old filters, as much as I can say. There's a 'smell' of old air throughout the hotel and in the room (I was), which could only be explained with less than efficient functioning of the a/c system."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Very nice stay.,room was very nice and cleaned. breakfast was a nice extra. very satisfied will book again.
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Check it out!,"Great experience. Friendly, helpful staff."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Very nice spot in inner harbor,"Great area, very clean and friendly. Traveling for business, would've been nice to have earlier breakfast options."

Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Very close to walking and restaurants,"Very nice breakfast with lots of choices, high quality offerings and comfortable seating"
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,kiddy pool,"Actually in room didn't work,and the pool is very small other then that stay was good."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,BALTIMORE GETAWAY,Well laid out floor plan. Comfy and roomy. Shower water pressure was a little low for me but well designed bathroom. Would stay here again. Cheaper parking 1/2 block away(4 on weekends).
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,1,Room smelled like marijuanna,"When we arrived in our room around 10:30 pm we noticed a very strong odor. We tried waiting it out for about an hour, but it never subsided. We think the smell was marijuana. At about midnight, we had to pack up all our stuff with a 3 and 5 year old and swap rooms. Hotel offered no type of reimbursement or anything."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,"very nice hotel, but a little high price","very nice hotel, but a little high price"
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Perfect getaway,Just a wonderful time the staff was outstanding.
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,"Nice hotel, a big outside of the inner Harbor","The hotel staff was fabulous. I dealt with Franklin and India, and was very pleased with their service. The room could have been a bit cleaner, and the pool and area also needed a good cleaning, but overall the hotel was in good condition."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,3,It was ok close to little Italy,"The room was ok, no water in the room, stains in the carpet and the water cost 3.00 p/b in the lobby. No parking and the valet cost 35.00 per day."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Chic new feeling,"Brand new feeling, chic, expert decor design. Beautiful rooms with sitting area, glass shower. Small fitness room with dumbbells, small indoor pool. One block from Whole Foods, 2 blocks from Four Seasons, located in East Harbor. Good price. I would do again."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Great hotel.... Greater location!,3-block walk to the inner harbor. Staff was excellent - front desk manager carried bags to my room for me since there were no luggage carts available... Will stay again if I visit Baltimore again!
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,3,Almost perfect,The bell hop and guest service was good until after I checked in and shift change I asked the next one on duty of there was room available and she said no for more family was gonna get a room there while sitting at the bar I watched a couple walk in off the street and ask if there was rooms available and low and behold they were rented a room
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Perfect stay,Close enough to the harbor or be an easy walk. Near a movie theatre and an ice cream store. Very convenient.
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,GirlFriends Getaway!!!,My girlfriends and I celebrated there BIRTHDAY and Recovery in Bmore. It was our first time in the hotel. The staff was excellent especially the Manager(Rozellen) She very helpful in given us the best restaurant and clubs to go to..Only bad thing I didn't like was paying too much for valet parking it was very costly... But overall it was close to the harbor the other end by Fells Street which was great small local shops and bars. If you looking for different view of Baltimore this hotel is where u need to be.. We shall be back in June
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Love the Hyatt Place!!,"Everything was amazing! The staff was very helpful and professional at all times! It was a very welcoming atmosphere. It is located in a great area where everything(mall, restaurants, aquarium,museum etc) is in walking distance."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,great second stay-will come back,"second time that I stay in this hotel, and it was great. Great location, within walking distance to both inner harbor and Fells Point, with plenty of bars and restaurants and shopping. the hotel is right around the corner from a couple of great restaurants (my fave: Ten/Ten) and Whole Foods. the staff is always very nice but the hostess at the front couldn't figure out where the rooms with a view of the harbor were, so although she tried to accommodate our request, we ended up with a room facing the opposite direction, looking at a brick wall... other than than, the hotel is great. very convenient bar/snack station in the lobby, great hot breakfast, and fabulous gym (small pool)."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,3,Issues,"Problems with room , brand new Hotel paint peeling, tile broken in shower, room flooded."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Great stay,Rooms were very clean. Staff was very helpful. Hotel in walking distance to restaurants in little Italy. Suggest using parking lot behind hotel. Parking is about 10 compared to hotel valet at 35
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,"Great Hotel, Great Service, Little water pressure!","Clean hotel, with exceptional staff. I would have given this hotel the highest rating, but unfortunately, they decided to put low flow shower heads in the rooms. My room, and other rooms, reported by friends who stayed here last weekend, all had the same complaint. They could barely rinse the shampoo out of their hair. It was that bad."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Comfy and convenient,Hyatt Place was in a great location. Tons of restaurants nearby and short walking distance to the harbor. The rooms were so neat and clean and so comfortable. I really enjoyed it. The only downfall was parking. The hotel doesn't have its own parking garage. They do have Valet parking but it was too expensive. Good thing there was a municipal parking garage right behind the hotel that was cheap because there wasn't a lot of street parking nearby. We ended up taking ubers to other locations that were longer distances so we didn't have to go in and out of the parking garage and pay each time.
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Great stay except...,"It was a wonderful stay however for some reason money was transferred out of my bank account towards this hotel for 86 and nobody knew why which was disappointing. However, the stay was great."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Great experience!,"Initially, I was a bit apprehensive because of the price of the parking and the lack of photos of the front and street view of the hotel. But I was very relieved by the parking garage around the corner of the hotel which costed 14.00 versus 42.00 for hotel valet parking. I was pleased with the location of the hotel as it was very conveniently located near a great restaurant (Nandos), a 24 hour CVS and a Whole Foods market. The staff at the hotel were very friendly from the moment we approached the outside of the hotel to the front desk, life guard at the pool and servers during the free breakfast. Great experience!"
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Baltimore 'newby' pleasant surprise,"Very nice, new hotel in neighborhood convenient to Fell's Point and Little Italy. Hotel was still under construction... lobby bar and restaurant/shops attached around corner did not seem to be open yet, for example."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Nice hote,Nice hotel... pool was cold and could have been cleaned through the day

Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Enjoying Baltimore,The hotel is well located. The room was great. Staff very helpful and polite. Breakfast was not the best.
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Baltimore for 3 nights.,New hotel...nice size rooms and large bathroom. Great breakfast selections. Inner Harbor 4 block walk...good dining within close walking distance in Italian Town or Fels point.
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Quick retreat to Baltimore,"Last second decision to visit Baltimore. We were greeted by Marq, a pleasant young man, who upgraded us to a king suite. She even provided us discounted tickets to the aquarium when we checked out the following day. The room was very spacious, clean and quiet. (Our room was close to the elevators but we didn't eben noticed it). The location of the hotel is central to the inner harbor offerings and to Little/Italy and Fells landing. There are many upscale stores nearby to browse as well as many fine restaurants. The gym was fine to work a quick sweat. Breakfast included was decent but nothing to rave about. Overall, the staff was very courteous and the hotel had a modern edge look which suited us just fine. Marq was the superstar during our stay. HIgh recommendation."
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,4,Snowbound,"Overnight business stay. Brand new Hotel. Neat and clean. Friendly staff. This is the 3rd Hyatt Place I have stayed since November, and the concept just works well for me. It was a trudge in the snow to Fells Point, but when warm weather arrives, it will transform into a nice stroll. Will return again"
Hyatt Place Baltimore/Inner Harbor,5,Second Stay,My second stay was almost as pleasant as my first. The room and amenities werE comfortable and well appointed.

Hampton Inn and Suites Baltimore Inner Harbor,2.1,The pool and the fitness room was cool.,"I've never been to a hotel where I had to pay to park in the facilty. 36 a night was ridiculous, the food tasted like it was for a school breakfast, the hotel for being in the downtown area looked worst than any hood I ever was in. They removed more money than they were supposed to thinking I wasn't going to notice, I was supposed to get a discount rate and they tried not to apply it. The pool and the fitness room was cool. the hotel was clean."
Hampton Inn and Suites Baltimore Inner Harbor,3.55,Parking is rediculous,Bad: I didnt like being charged 35.00 a night for parking when everything I needed was within walking distance. I will choose a different place next time.

Hampton Inn and Suites Williamsburg-Central,2.9,"Good location, but abyssal customer service","Bad: The room we had was situated next to an electrical room, which was noisy and loud throughout the night. We did not have a refrigerator for our drinks, and we asked manager re: both. She said she would take care of the problem. Unfortunately, she did not bring the refrigerator or move us to another room. We should have at least had our room charge reduced, but t no avail.

Hampton Inn and Suites Williamsburg-Central,2.5,Location and pool,"Bad: The hotel room did not meet expectations. There was shaved hair in the shower (did not belong to us) and the water did not get hot. It took 10 minutes of running the water to even get to a somewhat comfortable temperature. It was requested for our two rooms to be beside each other and that request was unable to be met.

"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,excellent hotel,the only negative comment i have is that thr room service breakfast waas not very good at all. other than that our stay was excellent and i would recommend it to everyone staying in the area.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",3,Pier 5,Comfortable room and great location. A little noisy though due to lobby noise
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",4,Good location in Inner Harbor,Lots to do within walking distance. Staff friendly. Have to be Hilton Honors member or you have to pay for Wi- Fi

"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",4.6,Check to see if there is a prom there before you stay....sucked!,"Bad: The last night there was a prom. I guess one of the parties decided to continue in to the night next door. Loud talking and slamming of the doors,up until 3 am. The desk knew about it when I called but nothing was done. I will never stay there again, paying so much and living like a Days Inn. All the desk could say was they were sorry. Good: The staff and extras were good. The room was nice and view was good. Comfortable room. Loved the crabby evening activities."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",4,Recommend,Wonderful last minute rate. Beautiful hotel in prime location.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,Pier 5/Rams Head stay,Bad: Supposed to get call when room was ready. Did get a text but only to text if I needed assistance. Not really much of a problem as timing between eating and room being ready before evening event worked out. Good: Within walking distance to evrything we did. Parking adjacent to motel. Have stayed
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",4,Great location for doing Inner Harbor,"Came up midweek for a quick break and an Orioles game, so did not spend much time in the hotel. But we were pleased with everything. Prices seemed high all over the area, perhaps because of an event at the convention center, so this was more than expected. But for what we wanted to do -- the aquarium, the ball game, a water taxi ride -- this is a great place to stay."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,Pier 5 Hotel,The hotel was clean. The staff was excellent. I truly enjoyed my stay.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,Pier 5 Hotel - Baltimore Gem,The Pier 5 Hotel is at a great Baltimore location at the Inner Harbor. It is one of the smaller hotels but size isn't important. The convenience to the harbor and restaurants is terrific.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,loved it,Loved it. Had a wonderful stay.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",4,Loud ambient music,The hotel played loud music in common areas which were audible in the rooms as well. I called down at 1 a.m. to ask that the music be turned off. The receptionist was extremely apologetic and turned it off right away - but I was told that they generally keep it on all night.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,Pier 5 - Great location in the Inner Harbor Area,"Walking distance to everything in the Inner Harbor Area. Enjoyed walking everywhere and exploring. The hotel is close to the aquarium, restaurants, shopping, etc. The staff was very friendly, enjoyed crabby hour, and the room was comfortable."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,Very Convenient to attractions and dining in the Inner Harbour!,"Fun decor in lobby and in rooms. Nice ammenities. Bed was extremely comforable, one of the best nights sleep ever!"
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",3.35,The bed was comfortable.,"Bad: Room was dingy and not well maintained. Paint job was messy, wallpaper was bubbled. Bathroom sink and shower were dirty and old. Good: The bed was comfortable."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,awsome hotel awsome service,it was very clean. the people were very friendly. it was right on the harbor so everything was walking distance.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",3,"Comfortable stay, but..","The room was very comfortable and clean. The biggest complaint would be that the shower water barely got above luke warm and the walls were terribly thin. There is no DVD player in the room and the breakfast offerings are minimall. Oh, and beware. Parking is expensive. Great location though."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,"Very good hotel in an excellent location, but Pizzazz....well","Don't misunderstand - we would fully recommend the hotel itself. The restaurant Pizzazz Tuscan Grille is another story. Food was OK, portions were small for the and service was bad. There are much better choices nearby."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",4.6,"No help with area restaurants, attractions or directions","Bad: No help with area restaurants, attractions or directions."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",4,Perfect for my stay,"I wanted quiet with no amenities. I thoroughly enjoyed and used the wave sound machine in the room. I enjoyed the crabby hour one of the two nights I stayed. Staff and shuttle service were extrememly helpful and timely. I could walk all over the Inner Harbor and keep my car parked in an adjacent lot. Due to bad weather, I was able to just walk to the restaurant attached and have an excellent meal."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,One of the best hotels I've stayed in.,Bad: There is nothing I didn't like. Good: Very friendly staff and very clean.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,Nice location,"We were very pleased with the room and thought the location of the hotel was great. It was a no hassle experience to bring our dog which was wonderful. The only negative was that they couldn't find our reservation right away, but that may have been because we have a two part last name."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",4,Perfect location!,"We only had two days to spend in Baltimore so I chose this hotel based on it's location. It was even better than I anticipated. Walking distance to Fell's Point. The room was spacious and well appointed. It was loud in the morning with breakfast in the lobby and housekeeping starts knocking at 8am sharp. They'll keep knocking too which was irritating so if you want to sleep past 8 put the privacy card on your door handle. Breakfast ends at 10 which I wasn't told at check-in and didn't see in writing anywhere so we missed that the first day. We were there for crabby hour and it was delicious and a nice touch to the stay! I saw other reviews complaining about parking, we didn't have an issue. There's a lot and a ramp right next door."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",3,Good but...,"The room, staff, and chocolate bar were all great. The only issue was on Fridays and Saturdays the hotel hosts noisy events (such as proms) in their conference rooms, which open onto the atrium as do most of the rooms, which does not make for a quiet evening."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,deco deluxe.....,Revamped retro boutique hotel with exemplary service and the coolest decorating...top notch
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",1,Horrible is not a strong enough word.,Horrible service. Run down. Over-priced. Even the shower curtain was the wrong width (too narrow) for the shower. Sink clogged. Stains on furniture. Just gross. We stayed there only because our wedding reception was next door. Never again. So very disappointed. Don't let the lobby fool you. The only positive thing is the location.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,Heart of the harbor,Accessible to any places you want to go. Not that much of amenities in the hotel but still safe and cozy to stay in. Everyday they have Craby Hour - Free food/drinks.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,Good atmosphere,"The Pier 5 Hotel is excellent for a quite romantic weekend. Once you check in, you have Ruth Chris or McCormick and Schmick's right off the hotel lobby. Within walking distance is the entire Baltimore waterfront district with nightclubs for just about everyone. The only downside was parking. While parking is available next to the hotel, the cost is 22.00 per pay and if you use valet parking, it 29.00 per day. You would think for the price they charge per night for a room, parking would be included."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",2.1,Disappointed,Bad: Cleanliness of entire place Asked for room with view of harbor and got other side. Not many people there so not sure why. Parking securities. Good: Location People were very pleasant and helpful.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",3.55,Disppointed after many years of visiting property,Bad: We arrived later than expected. There was no assistance with the luggage. We had to carte everything to our room by ourselves. No help. Good: Facility is nice.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",3,Not worth the money,"Barely a 4-star. Bathroom looked like something out of a Holiday Inn. The actual room itself had a very conveniently mounted TV so high marks for that, but beyond that there was nothing indicative of the price point. The sheets, pillows, and bed were mediocre at best. Also the room had the same, if not cheaper, in-room AC unit as a Townplace Inn I stayed at as well. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, but that doesn't justify the price. Also, they provided 0 benefits as a Expedia VIP member. Definitely would not stay here again. I'd either price down and stay somewhere else, or go a little bit higher to a 5-star."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",4,great location,nice people great location. good room. clean and friendly
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,Outstanding,"We loved this Hotel, great location, clean and staff very friendly and helpful. They even let my dog come for no extra charge! we would go back in a heartbeat, infact next year we are.."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",3,For the price of the Hotel it should include breakfast.,"They charged 10.00 for Continental Breakfast even for minors, my grand daughter is 6 years old, how much can she eat, and you do not have any other choices for children, and if you want from a menu is over 14.00 per item."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,Pier 5,The hotel location was excellent. The attached restaurants are high end and perfect for celebrating a special occasion. The Saturday afternoon chocolate and champagne tasting was a real treat. The included breakfast had made to order omelettes with all fresh ingredients. Bathroom was spacious and the room was cozy. I would return here on my next trip to Baltimore.
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,We were treated like royalty by the hotel staff.,"Unfortunately, we had an emergency as soon as we walked off the plane. I received a phone call that my brother had passed away. When I got to the hotel and explained it to the front desk supervisor, Empriss, she was very compassionate. She did everything in her power to make our shortened stay as comfortable as possible. All the staff were very friendly and I plan on returning as soon as possible to complete our trip. Our room was awesome. Very clean. The view was awesome. We plan on returning as soon as possible to complete our trip. Thanks Empriss for being so kind and caring."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",4,Wedding venue,"If you are looking for a place to have your wedding in Baltimore, this would be it. If you're looking to stay for the weekend, be aware that there is a chance there will be a lot of wedding activity, crowds and loud music. This might interrupt your stay."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",5,"the dcor, the cleanliness, the comfortable bed and the...","Good: the dcor, the cleanliness, the comfortable bed and the location!"
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",3,Too little for too much,"While the place is certainly interestingly decorated, and very quiet during the off season, there are very few amenities, at least of the sort we were interested in. No pool, no hot tub, no gym, but you can get a bucket of mid-level wine sitting on your bed when you arrive. Second floor has nice balconies overlooking the water."
"Pier 5 Hotel Baltimore, Curio Collection by Hilton",4,To visit the Aquarium,"Stayed one night to visit the Aquaruim before leaving the US. Great location, staff very helpful, rooms good size comfortable."

Homewood Suites by Hilton Baltimore,4.6,My stay was very comfortable and would stay again but I would eat elsewhere,"Bad: Breakfast was not appetizing, eggs were very cold, toaster very old and didn't work very wellonly had one breakfast meat some people don't eat pork should always have two meats. Dining room very dated needs upgrades. Good: Rooms were excellent and very comfortable."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Baltimore,3.95,BALTIMORE VACAY!!,Bad: N/A. Good: The coffee was good and the room was real nice.
Homewood Suites by Hilton Baltimore,5,A family of four looking to get away.,"Bad: Parking is probably the only downside. You have to park in a parking garage which is fine, but expensive. But I guess thats what you get for staying in the city. It was all worth it though because the location was amazing. Good: The location is amazing. We were able to walk to everything. The room was clean and comfortable for my family of 4. The free breakfast was also great. We had an issue with internet that was taken care of really quickly. We had a great time and look forward to staying again"
Homewood Suites by Hilton Baltimore,4.4,Staff was very accommodating,"Bad: Heat wasn't working properly in our room, had it up to 80 degrees and had to use extra blankets when sitting on couch and sleeping. Good: Staff was very accommodating"

SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,3.15,"I expected more for the money. Also will not honor any kind of legit discounts. Such as AAA, Vets","Bad: At breakfast, could not keep up with demand."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,4.8,"Great place to stay, convenient to most things, we will definitely stay here again!",Bad: Coffee wasn't always available in lobby!. Good: Breakfast was great. Beds were very comfy! View was fantastic!

SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,4.8,THE place for my birthday! !,"Bad: When I made the reservation, they told me one thing. When I got there, the first person told me something different. Third person resolved it. Good: The staff was excellent!!initially I didn't get the room I asked for when I made the reservation. They wasted no time correcting the situation. Made my birthday stay very pleasant! Excellent location."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,4.6,I loved the location and the staff was very friendly and...,The beds are very uncomfortable I loved the location and the staff was very friendly and helpful
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,2.7,Was This A Vacation or did I feel like I was at home having to take care of everything,"Bad: I didn't care for the fact that we had to keep asking for the simple things such as, towels, sheets, glasses. Had to have them clean the tub before we even step foot in it because it was black at the bottom. Had to request that the garbage be emptied. Maintenance was called twice, once for the toilet and another because the air conditioning wasn't working. I would think for a hotel that charges you IN FULL for your stay before you leave the check in counter would be on top of things making their guests happier. Good: The view and location of the hotel was perfect and breakfast was nice except for the juices... The hotel outdoor pool was nice but the bar wasn't fully stocked and the food was HORRIBLE."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,3.15,Very Disappointed!,Bad: There was not a dinette set in the room so that my husband and I could eat comfortably. The room was much smaller than I thought it was and there was no safe to put valuables in when we went out. I was not comfortable leaving any thing of value in my room. There was no outdoor pool as stated by you and there was no jacuzzi. Breakfast food was cold and not tasty at all. I don't feel like I got my money's worth from this resort and I will not be staying at Spring Hill Suites ever again. Good: I liked the king size bed.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,3.55,Enjoyable vacation,sofa that pulled out to bed was very uncomfortable. Springs were coming thru mattress. We had to get extra comforts to make it sleepable.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,3.55,Location and facilities.,Bad: On one day our room did not cleaned until after 6.15 pm despite several messages. The front desk response was that the hotel was busy and it was not unheard of for rooms not be done at 6pm - and offered an apology as did housekeeping. We were more than a little surprised to hear this...most hotels are busy mid summer. We have experinced delays but nothing like this. We had to reschedule dinner appointment. As we were only there for 2 nights it was rather disappointing. Good: Location and facilities.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,5,the location and the front desk girls were excellent.,nothing the location and the front desk girls were excellent.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,3.75,Overall the stay was good.,"Bad: I didn't care about some of the staff attitude they could have been a little more friendlier towards the guest at the hotel,and I think it was a little to pricey for the stay. Good: I liked how clean the hotel was and the comfort of the room. The breakfast was good as well."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,4.8,All the amenities!,Had to pay up front and had a misunderstanding that we couldn't split Bill and we were going to lose our room next night! Got someone else at front desk who figured it out!! Phew!! All the amenities! Great location!
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,2.5,Breakfast,Good: Breakfast
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,5,Well worth the price.,"Bad: Breakfast. Good: Excellent family enjoyed everything. Staff friendly and helpful. Arrived early gave phone number and they called when room was ready 2 hours before check in. Location wonderful for us, we walked every where. Direct access to beach. Outside pool great, food there was good too and not to pricey. Overall great stay. Well worth the price. U get what u pay for. Breakfast could have been a lil better, my personal opinion."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,4.15,We liked the location of the hotel to the activities going...,"Bad: Hot tub was very dirty, needed a good wash down and no in house restraunt. The station 10 grill associated with property was good but not located within hotel. Good: We liked the location of the hotel to the activities going on for the week we traveled and it's easy access to beach and boardwalk, breakfast was really good, but gotta get up early to avoid long lines."

Sense Beach House,4.15,Absolutely cosy and great location,"Bad: The staff, specially at the restaurant is arrogant and not well trained. The pool area wasnt cleaned in the morning, cleaning ladies came later on and did only the basic to clean it. Rooms in the first floor are noisy and you can hear the music of the restaurant below. A gym would be a very nice to have. Good: The rooftop pool was so nice and with a beautiful view to the sea. Rooms are absolutely cosy. The restaurant is nice furnished and serves excellent food. Excellent location."

Sense Beach House,4.6,Good stay overall!,"Bad: Only 1 street parking spot to get registerd. Valet parking was not convenient. Did not even know where my car was at and not being able to retrieve my beach chairs, etc. Extra charge was put on account after departure but management removed it. Good: The view"
Sense Beach House,5,Beach location,"Good: Awesome location one block from the beach, and a small swimming pool on the roof. Nice balcony also!"
Sense Beach House,3.75,Staff was very kind when you managed to get hold of them.,"Valet service takes too long. You can try to call before, but with me they never picked up the phone. Advice is to get down 30 min before you need your car. Staff was very kind when you managed to get hold of them. Good property overall, specially for the price."
Sense Beach House,4.8,Great hotel........Great Location,"Good: Great welcome, Offered an upgrade supercool room, Only one block back from the beach Easy to get to from the airport, 2.25 on the bus"

A few staff members not so friendly. Good: Loved the room, it was cute, cozy, and comfortable! View was not too great, hoped for more of a ocean view."
Sense Beach House,4.8,Very good small hotel in an excellent location for whatever you might want to do in south Beach.,"Bad: 195 a night (including resort fee) is expensive but it is Miami and all hotels seem to be this much, I cant fault the hotel so its a case of pay up and smile!. Good: Excellent location at the quiet end of Ocean Drive but still within walking distance of bars and restaurants, beach, shops and local buses. Very comfy beds, beach towels and chairs available for use. Free glass of wine on an evening was a nice touch."
Sense Beach House,3.35,great night on south beach Miami,"Bad: being told we had missed our free glass of wine as we arrived to late, how hard would it have been to just give us a glass, also being told no free breakfast included as we booked via bookings.com, when you book with bookings.com you want to feel valued not at a disadvantage. no kettle, what is it about Americans not putting a kettle for a nice cup of tea in each room, you will get liters of alcohol to buy but why not just put a 12 dollar kettle and two mugs, costs so little but means so much. would boost my scoring on every hotel review i do. Good: position on south beach road is great, roof top pool great, nice room, hotel a little tired, stained carpets cracked bathroom work tops etc. my advice would be replace carpets in room halls ways from lift to room. lots of stains. iced water by lift this is great. lovely bed and pillows.stayed one night, lovely lady on reception day we left, helped us get a taxi. I would stay again however its expensive a bottle of water in the room is about 6 dollars, drank in error not understanding it was a cost option. drink iced water in reception, very nice."

Sense Beach House,4.8,"This is a gorgeous little hotel on ocean drive, 200 yards...","Bad: Nothing, I cherished my stay here. Good: This is a gorgeous little hotel on ocean drive, 200 yards from the busy beach front, just far enough for it to be quiet through the night, the veiw from the rooftop pool was exquisite, the rooms and the restaurant were also of the highest standard. Loved it"
Sense Beach House,4.6,Fantastic Location,Bad: A little pricey. Good: Staff members were very nice. The food at the hotel's restaurant was extremely delicious. Walking distance to the beach and many other restaurants on Ocean Drive. The rooms were clean and spacious.

Sense Beach House,4.6,"helpful friendly staff, excellent location, clean,...","Good: helpful friendly staff, excellent location, clean, light beautifuly decorated rooms, comfortable bathroom (normal shower with a shower hand! :) ), pool that you can almost have for your own use as there were not many people using it."
Sense Beach House,4.6,Great value in a quiet area close to the beach,"Bad: Hotel restaurant was good but a bit pricey. Good: Very good value, located across from the beach but several blocks south of the chaos and noise. If arriving by auto, be aware that parking in MB is a problem. Private lots charge 30-40/day. I suggest parking in municipal garages within walking distance for half the cost."
Sense Beach House,3.35,Bad and slow WiFi connection,Bad and slow WiFi connection
Sense Beach House,4.15,South Pointe coolness and wibe... Great small hotel for any solo traveler or couple.,Bad: Internet connection not great from my room. Good: Quiet and great bed... But room a bit dark and no view. Super service and boutique feeling to everything.
Sense Beach House,4.8,Close enough to Ocean Drive to walk but far enough off that...,Bad: I needed directions on how to work the shower -took forever to figure out how to get hot water. Good: Close enough to Ocean Drive to walk but far enough off that you didn't have to fight to get into the hotel from the street. Couldn't hear street noise. Comfortable room and great staff.
Sense Beach House,2.3,Not good for me,"Bad: This place wasn't just right for me: Booked a room with partial sea view - got one on the second floor which was blocked by a palm tree, staff was ok but tended to be on the arrogant side. Lots of younger people stayed there so if you are looking for a more boutique type of hotel that deserves the name you may want to look somewhere else. Good: The bed was very comfortable"
Sense Beach House,5,Great in every way,Staff was excellent. Room was great and the atmosphere of the hotel was wonderful. As far as location - how can you go wrong a block off the beach
Home2 Suites by Hilton Baltimore Downtown,3.15,Price,Bad: Price for valet No dining on site Housekeeping. Good: Price
Home2 Suites by Hilton Baltimore Downtown,2.9,Nice enough but better locations available.,Bad: Our bathroom wasn't cleaned all that well. The kitchen had sticky spots. The walk to everything was kind of far for my family. Good: Friendly staff. Nice area near the lobby to sit.
Home2 Suites by Hilton Baltimore Downtown,3.75,"The hotel seems to cater to long-stay visitors, so the room...","Bad: Breakfast, though a big step up from the basic continental breakfast, was a little disappointing. The hot option was a choice of three different flatbreads that you can toast yourself. Also, it's only served from 6AM-9AM, fine for business travelers but a bit early for our weekend visit. Good: The hotel seems to cater to long-stay visitors, so the room was set up like a small apartment with couch, TV, desk, and well-equipped kitchen area with a full-sized fridge, plates and silverware, microwave, and dishwasher. Furniture and decor were modern and well thought-out."
Home2 Suites by Hilton Baltimore Downtown,4.6,The staff were very friendly and helpful.,Bad: The lack of free parking. Good: The staff were very friendly and helpful. They were responsive very quickly to my concerns

Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel,3.95,The staff was very accommodating to the problems we had at...,"Bad: We came in the evening after a long business journey and I was pulling the luggage for me and my assistant in and there was no one to assist me , two people walked by and the third finally asked me if I needed help. I was not please. Then, I had booked a room with two beds and they sent me to a room with king size bed. I had to go back to front desk with my luggage. The front desk person was great she upgraded us to a suite on the executive floor and turned the situation around. Good: The staff was very accommodating to the problems we had at check in and made a bad situation much better. the customer service was excellent at the front desk"
Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel,4.15,Good spot for an early flight.,Bad: No accessible HDMI port on TV. Good: Convenient airport access.
Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel,5,Perfect Spot to Fly Out Early From!!,"Bad: Though I booked through Bookings.com, they had no record of my reservations nor could they find any. They compted us and our driver with free drinks until they got it straightened out. Fortunately they still had a double room. The manager bought dessert after our lovely bar light dinner as well!!. Good: We had a wonderful stay prior to an early morning flight to Geneva, Switzerland"
Sheraton Portland Airport Hotel,3.35,"Not the greatest, but slept well.","Bad: Booked through booking.com and my reservation wasn't sent to the Sheridan, so when I got there, they had no record of my stay. Sheridan was very accommodating, a tad expensive, but stayed because other family members were there. Very clean. Doesn't have curb appeal, but the inside looks up to date and modern. Went to the hotel bar for a drink and some apps - Sauvignon Blanc didn't taste like sauvignon blanc, cheese platter had more meats than cheese, meatballs were rubbery, waitress was very nice. Breakfast at the same place was great. Easy check out. Good: Booked through booking.com and my reservation wasn't sent to the Sheridan, so when I got there, they had no record of my stay.

Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,4.8,Loved it but they need a waffle maker!,"Bad: Noisy AC unit exhaust fan in bathroom did not exhaust, Great breakfast but no Waffle maker. Good: Staff very attentive and friendly, great service, nice and clean."
Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,3.75,It was very close to the beach within walking distance.,Bad: The remote in our room did not work for the Television so we had to manually get up and change the channels. There were not as many facilities as we had in previous hotels Oceanfront and the cost was much more expensive then those hotels. The stay was much more convenient at the previous hotels than this one. Swimming pool is to small. . Good: It was very close to the beach within walking distance. Room had balcony so we were able to catch the breeze from the Ocean. Room was clean. Free guest parking. Complimentary Breakfast was great. Whirlpool was place to relax/enjoy as a spa you could say.

Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,5,Enjoyed my stay,Bad: Lots of chlorine in the pool area. Good: I really enjoyed my stay there

Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,3.35,Will try other options at our next stay,Bad: Didn't feel the room was what was portrayed when booked. Good: Nice temp outside breezy and could leave the windows open
Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,3.15,Disappointing,"Bad: I had made my reservations 3 months ago for a 1 night stay for my friends aND I. We have been making this trip for 40+ years, and are certainly used to paying premium hotel rates for very average hotel rooms due to the season and oceanfront property. However this hotel room was very disappointing. We were given a handicap access room.Keep in mind, we are able bodied, active middle-aged ladies who rin marathons. This room had a bathroom that provided a shower stall for a wheelchair access, thus no way to prevent water from the shower head to go all over the bathroom. What a mess! We basically had to sop up water from the floor after each of us showered. The rooms only provide double beds, so even for the smaller ladies, was a cramped sleeping experience. Upon registering and first entering the room, I asked if we could have another room option.The front desk declined indicating that other rooms were not available.So, we paid over 350 a night for a below standard room. They should have at least offered us a discount. We will seek other accommodations for our annual trip next year!. Good: Location is great. Easy access to the boardwalk and beach.Decent hot and cold complimentary breakfast."
Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,4.6,Stayed in recently renovated room- excellent,Bad: Did not like the breakfast.
Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,3.95,Nice location.,Good: Nice location. Friendly staff
Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,3.15,overall acceptable stay - enjoyed it!,"Bad: dated, needs face lift and upgrades, rusted and moldy areas inside room, stains on ceilings and closet doors, shower head leaking, sink cracked, small TV for room size, room phone old and crackling when trying to use, food buffet cold and stale - potatoes hard and egg omelettes rubbery, pool small, exercise room even smaller, can't control non-stop planes taking off but would be nice to inform the guests in advance - very loud and ear piercing - constant for hours and hours.... Good: convenient location and breathtaking views, fair price for location, decent parking, coffee and ice water 24-7!"
Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,4.6,Nice clean place very friendly staff great location...,Bad: Parking was a little odd if you stop at the office to check in you block all other traffic coming and going from the parking garage . Good: Nice clean place very friendly staff great location excellent view of the ocean
Fairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott Virginia Beach Oceanfront,3.35,Okay room,Bad: Furniture worn. Good: location
Villa Paradiso,5,Great Place to Stay!!!!,Good: I loved having a microwave and fridge. Very cozy!
Villa Paradiso,4.8,"Perfect location, central to everything.","Good: Perfect location, central to everything."
Villa Paradiso,4.6,Quaint with an art deco feel.,Bad: Bed wasn't awful but could have been better. Parking is a couple blocks away in a garage (I would consider this neutral - pretty much standard for Miami Beach). Good: Quaint with an art deco feel. I will definitely be back!
Villa Paradiso,3.15,Decent,"Bad: The unesessary complaints regarding noise level which included laughter in the court yard as not above he constant noise level of the street. Good: Unfortunately, the occupants are a mixture of residents and vacationers. Not a good mix for individuals wanting to enjoy their vacation as residents will complain if you are too loud."
Villa Paradiso,5,It was absolutely great!,Bad: Couldn't have been any better. Good: It was absolutely great! Little hidden gem in the middle of South Beach!
Villa Paradiso,4.4,"Nice, comfortable stay","Bad: I wasn't in love with the location, but it's on a main road with a bunch of similar places. Also, the payment situation was a little annoying, and I wish the chairs outside looked a little cleaner. Although, it rains a lot so I imagine the upkeep is difficult. Good: I liked how clean and spacious the suite was. It was super cute. The staff was friendly and it was an easy walk to the beach."
Villa Paradiso,3.35,There is nothing on website or booking.,"Bad: There is nothing on website or booking.com about the rules, and there are many, at this hotel, or that it is a quiet hotel. There is nothing about quiet hours starting at 11 on the sites either. Nothing about the limit to number of people that can visit you in your room. Nothing about the fact that when people come to see you they will be detained at the gate and not allowed to enter if you have more than 4 extra people you are visiting with in your room or the outside courtyard area. If these are the rules then fine, but we would NOT have stayed here if we had known this .Please put this information on both sites so that others do not have the same experience we did. A woman in the office was very rude and threatened to call the police for no reason. She was extremely rude and disrespectful and threatening during our stay. There are ways to communicate respectfully and calmly and this was not the case. I would never ever ever tell anyone to stay at this hotel. In fact, I will tell everyone I know to avoid going to this hotel unless they want to be treated rudely. I am sure that this woman in the office will respond saying she was not rude or threatening, but take my word, I do not ever write reviews and this is exactly what occurred and it made the stay unpleasant and uncomfortable and impossible to make plans to go out with friends. Ridiculous."
Villa Paradiso,3.75,"Quiet, nice hotel in central location in Miami Beach",Bad: The floors need more thorough cleaning. Good: Nicely situated hotel in Miami Beach. Pleasant architecture with patio-like outdoor seating area where you can relax. Friendly and helpful staff. Public parking one block down.

Villa Paradiso,4.6,Miami Beach without paying for the frills,Bad: The air conditioning unit is v v v noisy. Good: The location is second to none! Accommodation is rustic and cute
Villa Paradiso,4.8,Great place to stay,"Bad: Everything was great. In the future the bathroom could use an update. Good: Great location only a minute away from the beach, room cleaning every day and well working WiFi."
Villa Paradiso,5,Landed on our feet with this place.,Bad: Coffee could be better quality. Good: The position if the room at the ba k away from the street was excellent. There was no bar so no young noisy people!! Yeah!! The veranda and the garden area was well shaded so could sit out in the cool. Near shops and two minutes to beach.

Villa Paradiso,4.8,All around for value,Good: All around for value
Villa Paradiso,4.6,Close stay to the BEACH ! !,"Bad: Could have initially had more room towels. Good: Villa Paradiso was minutes from the beach. The hotel also provided BEACH towels daily so you didn't have to worry about the hassle of towels. The room was fully equipped with a kitchen. Great for late night snacks or meal and keeping leftovers cold in the fridge. I felt very secured at the hotel. The outside gate had its on key so that was a bonus. Walgreens is right across the street, we may have visited it a dozen times. Will book again when I come to MIAMI."
Villa Paradiso,4.15,Good choice!,Good: Location great and close to everything. Spacious and self-catering.
Villa Paradiso,5,Great place,Bad: Nothing. Good: Beautiful and romantic

Motel 6 Grand Rapids - Airport,3,"Not the greatest, but not a bad hotel","I stayed at this hotel in mid October. It has changes names since apparently. It is now known as a Motel 6. Online, when I booked through a company, it said that breakfast was included. It is not included anymore, that was a bummer. The location is good. The room itself is basic, but wasn't too bad.

Blue Sky Lodge,4,"Great ""rural hotel"" near Carmel, CA","What a nice little hotel in a gorgeous rural area near Carmel, CA. Both office staff members were very helpful and the hotel grounds and pool area are nicely maintained. The town itself is cute as can be and has several small cafes with outside seating and a couple of nicer restaurants for more formal dining."
Blue Sky Lodge,3,quiet homey setting away from downtown Carmel,homey. nice terraces. Lovely living room. unpretentious. not your standard-issue motel.
Blue Sky Lodge,2,Blue Sky Motel - a gray experience,"I thought this would be a cute, quaint, retro motel but it turned out to be closer to Bates Motel than a Blue Sky experience. The carpet had stains, the pool was broken, there were dogs barking in one of the rooms and there were ants crawling in the bathroom sink. Won't be back."
Blue Sky Lodge,4,Cozy Stay,"The lodge has the basic amenities. TV, Bathroom. Bed and small coffee pot. It was sufficient for the most part. My husband and I would of liked a small fridge or somewhere we could store some ice. The grounds of the lodge, were beautiful! I loved the throwback architecture of the rooms with the patios, it was very private! The... More"
Blue Sky Lodge,4,"Pretty basic, but very friendly, old hotel","Carmel Valley is a pricey place, but the Blue Sky Lodge is a reasonable accommodation right in the main bit of town. It's a bit old, and the rooms look ridiculously low rent from the outside (think beach bathrooms) but on the inside they're not bad at all. The balconies are wonderful, and the optional little kitchenette is useful. The pool and hot tub are a great distraction (do say hello to Molly the pool dog)."
Blue Sky Lodge,4,located close to town center,"The hotel is very out-dated - it had the felling of going to Catskill, NY for family vacation in the 50s. I was told that it was family owned for sixty years and I am sure that not many changes have been made during that time. It's hard to say what needs to be done - it was fine for us people who still remember 60s but our children were a little bit disappointed that kitchen and other amenities were not updated. Rooms were clean, cleaning service was friendly and responsive however everything looked rugged, old and lacked any charm. Too bad because the place is located in beautiful part of Carmel Valley. On the other hand if it exists for 60 years people must find it attractive and I wish the owner(s) good luck with this place for the next 60 years."
Blue Sky Lodge,3,ok,"Stay was ok, but a little expensive for what you can expect. Bad smell in the room, otherwise it was good."
Blue Sky Lodge,5,Surprised by Blue Sky Hotel,Very nice quiet rooms (all separated) with their own courtyard. Very friendly staff. Short walk to town and wine tasting!
Hilton Garden Inn,4,A good place to stay,We were traveling through town and were very pleased with our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. The staff was very cordial and helpful. The room was large and clean. It was easy to access from both the interstate and from the town center.
Courtyard Austin South,5,Nice and Clean,"The room was nice and clean. The staff was polite and helpful. There were always refreshments in the lobby. The lemonade was good as were the cookies. The staff offered us bottled water after check in and they were all friendly.It makes our day to hear that we excelled your expectations of cleanliness during your stay! Thank you so much for your five star review, and we look forward to welcoming you back on your next visit."

Tradewinds Restaurant,5,Great vacation,We had a great time. Everyone we met was super nice. Lots of amenities. We enjoyed our stay.
Tradewinds Restaurant,1,Disappointed,"Arrived to discover an outrageous parking fee (also did not offer any disabled veteran discounts). Check in was ok until we discovered the entire college football team was arriving that night. The room was ok, the thermostat did not work so the room was very warm. It wasn't until later that night that the football enthusiastic kicked in and needless to say, we managed about two hours of sleep. You would figure the hotel would have informed us of this when we booked the room or at least would have had the decency to tell the rude guest to hold the noise down since it was after midnight. Needless to say I could not recommend this hotel to anyone else."

Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,5,Embassy Suites Lithicum-High Quality Great Price,"The Embassy Suites Lithicum provided a high quality venue for our youth baseball team as we participated in a tournament that weekend. The team loved the atmosphere and ambiance of this Hilton brand hotel. It is among the nicer hotels that we now stay in due to an experience that we had with the standard accomodations at popular hotel chains such as DI, M6, S8, HJ, etc. The cook to order breakfast was a bonus. My only complaint would be is that it is a loud hotel on the weekend with special events and people constantly hanging out of there rooms on the atrium. It would also be great to at least provide free wireless in the common areas. The fee for wireless was almost 10/day and the business center was always full."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,5,Making the best of,"Our utility company needed to make upgrades to the sytem in our neighborhood and therefore, had to cut power for the day. We decided on a staycation, as the hotel was only 15 miles from our home. I'm glad we made the decision. The accomodations were large, comfortable and clean.

We plan to stay again soon."

Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,4,Good choice,"We were very tired when we arrived with a cranky baby. Pierre at the front desk was very helpful and got us in our room quickly. We had some difficulty with the door, the handle had to be pushed up, instead of down, which delayed us getting into the room. The room was clean though somewhat worn/dated (old phones, ceiling in bathroom had areas that needed repair/patched, carpet was threadbare in some areas, etc.). We were thankful that the room was very quiet which help us to get a good few hours of sleep before my daughter and grandson's flight. The shuttle driver that took us to BWI was exceptionally helpful and I was very grateful that he came back to pick me up after seeing my daughter and grandson off."

Very difficult to get a drink. Bartender was waiting on entire bar plus our seating area plus customers who wanteddrinks. The drinks may as well not have been free. Snacks were sparse and not replenished.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,4,Pre-cruise stay,"Needed a place to stay before Baltimore based cruise. Hotel could use a shuttle service to the pier like other hotels in the area. Also need a direct phone line from the airport to hotel for shuttle service like other hotels and services. If I hadn't brought along the phone number, I would have been stuck. Wish there were other restaurants nearby. Also need a better selection of drinks for managers reception--I have stayed at many other Em. Suites and have had a much better selection--also bartenders were a little surly and the place wasn't really that crowded. Snacks catered to Vegans. Front desk personnel were extremely helpful--above and beyond the call of duty."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,4,Perfect place outside of town.,"Greeted at check-in. Had to have an extra 25 held on my credit card in case of damages () - had to sign a No Party policy - that was a first. Room was clean and pleasant. Bed was clean and bathroom was clean. Breakfast was a bit hap-hazard in that the line was incredibly long to obtain a made-to-order omelette. Nice provisions for the breakfast. Set up was good. Food was better than I expected and they offered healthy choices for breakfast including yogurt, fresh fruit, oatmeal. I would stay again. I felt safe and the place was maintained well."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,3,Renovation -,Renovation in progress: strong chlorine smell during stay. My eyes watered throughout this stay.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,5,Starting vacation,Very clean hotel the beds very nice and close to the airport.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,4,"Very nice hotel, close to the airport.","When we checked in, we had no toiletries due to the strict airline restrictions from Canada, so the clerk at the front desk took care of everything for us with complimentary necessities. We were also given a complimentary appetizer for their restaurant, and were informed that daily happy hours was between 5:30 - 7:30 pm. Our room was really nice, clean and comfortable with updated furnishings. A little more attention to detail could have been made with the cleaning reagarding some marks and soiling on the walls, but nothing to complain about. After having spent over 30 hours travelling, we were very pleased to find that happy hour consisted of our choice of a long list of spirits, beer, and wine (unlimited), as well as tortilla chips, salsa and guacamole - all complimentary. A full breakfast buffet is included, which is as good as anywhere we've ever been. Sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, hashbrowns, milk, juice, tea, coffee, bagels, toast, english muffins, sweet buns, fruit, yogurt, and made to order omlette. Lunch and supper in the restaurant was also really good. Some of the best wings I've ever had."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,3,The hotel bathroom fittings were not good conditio,The cold and hot water faucet was not working. Bath faucet could not control cold and hot water mix and hot water burned my body
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,4,Great room for the money.,"Great hotel, well kept but the room had some strange bad smell, no big deal. Only problem we had a baby with us and had requested a crib at least five days before, and when we got there they said they did not have any available, not safe at all to sleep with the baby in our bed. Otherwise the rest was ok."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,4,Great amenities near the airport,"We stayed just one night on our way back to NJ from the University of Maryland, and decided to take the evening in Baltimore. The Embassy Suites is always a nice stay for us, particularly with the buffet breakfast. Hotel lodging and comfort were great, and the price was more affordable than staying right at the Inner Harbor. Rooms were comfortable and spacious, and the ground and interiors were classy. Would definitely stay there again for a Baltimore vacation. As you would imagine, this hotel is geared towards airport travelers and executives, and a shuttle runs continuously between the airport and hotel. I would suggest having a shuttle also running to the Inner Harbor, which would broaden the hotel's base of travelers by offering an easy way into the Harbor (and avoiding having to take the Light Rail service). Otherwise, everything was great."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,5,VERY NICE HOTEL CLOSE TO ALL AREA INTERESTS,"Your staff is extremely friendly, sincere and professional. A sense of caring, and security was clearly evident - with a driver to ensure a positive experience was provided. Room was nicely furnished with all the amenities. Breakfast and manager's special was the right touch with the right level of support too. Entire hotel is very warm to include common areas as well. Exercise room has everything to get in a workout and the pool and hot tub is a great treat too. The papers, especially the WSJ is a great complimentary item. Loved all of it and will certainly be back. Being from Hawaii, this stay was very nice and very warm !! Travel to Maryland often and first time staying here, but not the last."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,3,"Nice, But","The hotel staff is friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean. The location is horrible as there isn't anything close in the way of stores or restaurants. If you arrive late you will have extremely limited access for dinning except for the over priced microwave food at the front desk. Breakfast and cocktail hour are a nice touch, but both need to be extended by an hour."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,4,Best Complimentary Breakfast Ever!!!,I thought the hotel was beautiful from Miami like bar to the indoor pool and Jacuzzi to the Cooked-to -Order buffet breakfast. The prices weren't bad except for the 50 incidental hold they add to ur credit card. And the room should come with free wi fi. I mean they need to get with it. Even motel 6 offers that for free. But outside of that. Great service.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,4,Great for travelers!,"We stayed overnight before catching a flight out. The hotel was much nicer than we expected, the staff was friendly and our room had a living area and small kitchenette. The rooms were well insulated from noise. They had a nice happy hour (free drinks for guests from 5-7) and a MADE TO ORDER complimentary breakfast that were both great. I would not recommend the steakhouse located in the building. The food was decent, but overpriced and lacking in quality. The hotel also has a shuttle leaving for the airport every half hour. It made for a really nice stay for two weary travelers."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,2,Renovation needed badly,"This hotel needed to be renovated 5 years ago. It is very tired and kept poorly. Mildew in corners of tub, poor bath amenties and so so cleaning of rooms. The high speed internet that they charge you 9.95 for is a total joke - super slow and almost unusable. As a business traveler, I would never stay here again."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,3,"Not bad, but not great.","Nice large rooms, but our A/C did not work well, especially in the bedroom. This was a higher priced King Corner Suite. Only stayed for 1 night, so told front desk staff on the way out. Happy hour is a nice idea, but no way to get near the small and understaffed bar to get a drink. Could not check in at 1:00, had to wait until 3 pm, which is the rule, but would have been nice to find a room earlier. Breakfast was very good."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Baltimore at BWI Airport,4,"Great Hotel Chain, But Service Lags Behind","Embassy Suites as a chain is great. Who else offers the manager special and great breakfast buffet that, to us, is the hallmark of their hotel. However, I was disappointed with the service in Linthicum, MD during our stay. I did not feel the front desk was friendly or had smiles. I hate dealing with customer service that you feel you are inconveniencing. If you have kids that stay with you on the fold-out couch, they never have extra bedding in the room, if you want to make up the bed. We asked the front desk for the extra bedding. It wasn't provided. We called housekeeping. No answer. We called the desk, and eventually housekeeping brought up extra towels. Eventually, housekeeping brought up some bedding with a repeat call to the desk. The next morning their was no receipt on the floor by your door like most hotels. Because we didn't just wanted to go in the morning, after our yummy breakfast (during which mindful busboys kept our table clear of extra, now emptied dishes), we just wanted to pack up and leave without stopping by the desk. This was probably a big mistake, because I found out the next weekend, that the Linthicum charged us for the room on top of what I already paid hotels.com. That was incredibly annoying. What if never had checked my account. Could this have happened at another time, at one of their other locations Thankfully, a call to the polite desk supervisor took care of it for us. We're supposed to get a credit in a few days."

The Resort at Longboat Key Club,3,Not worth it the price!,"First it looks like something happen in the beach and a bunch of dead fish are laying on the sand, as soon as the sun comes out the smell is extremely bad. Secondly the rooms are set not to allow the AC to lower below 70 that made the room uncomfortable and third we where in the room for three days and the minibar wasn't re-stocked or was the sugars for the coffee maker or tea, it looks like only one elevator was working and it took forever!"
The Resort at Longboat Key Club,5,Talk About Service,"Have you ever been sitting on the beach with one of you very bestest friends, when, one of you wants to sit in the sun while the other prefers shade What to do What to do Well, Zach and Hunter solved that problem!

The Resort at Longboat Key Club,4,Fine front desk staff. Nice rooms. Great view of the Gulf.,The staff was great. The rooms were functional and comfortable. Not deluxe - but works. It's a bit of a trek to get to the mainland - don't be in a hurry at rush hour. But to stay at the hotel - great surroundings - and the access to the Gulf of Mexico is heavenly.
The Resort at Longboat Key Club,5,Summer Fun,"Freddy, Jake, Ozzy, and Ally were very good at keeping my friends and I satisfied while we enjoyed the gorgeous view here at the beach. They were ready to work and very enthusiastic during service! I definitely will be coming back and it was an amazing day at the beach!"

Best Western Plus Encina Inn & Suites,4,A little short...,"This was the only hotel with a 2 bedroom unit available for our stay with a mother in law. I dont know about the regular rooms but this one is a separate building with 4 suites, each one of them with a living / kitchen / half bath downstairs and 2 rooms and a full bath upstairs. Few details: kitchen was not stocked: no glasses, dishes, forks, knives, pans...so you cant cook. We were not planning to cook but a heads up. There was unfinished drywall work on ceiling, very old inefficient windows and uninsulated roof. Good heat source but very noisy, cant keep it on at night it will wake you up. The room has not been upgraded since the 80s: green carpet, wall paper...just that old beachy CA feel. Service was excellent, so was their restaurant, but we felt that for the price and location this suite needs to be revamped. Worked for 1 night though."
Best Western Plus Encina Inn & Suites,5,"Loved it. Great service and location. Fabulous restaurant. Yes, fabulous. Best eggs benedict ever.

Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Ap Gateway Park,5,Hampton Came Through in a Pinch,Our flight was cancelled due to the Southwest computer debacle of July 2016 so we needed to find rooms with very little notice. Fortunately the Hampton Inn Suites Denver/Airport-Gateway Park had space for us. After I returned our rental car Hampton sent a very luxurious shuttle bus to pick me up at the airport.

Residence Inn Chicago Deerfield,3,Okay long term,"I have been here since August 2015. Compared to the last two places I stayed, this is the best. There is a full kitchen and the bed is amazingly comfortable. I have had a couple of issues here: 1) Ants in my room. 2) The Internet SUCKKKKSSS 3) a/c unit blowing out during a storm. Since I am long term,... More"
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,4,A nice place to stay!,"Friendly staff, HUGE breakfast, clean rooms, quiet at night, close to the interstate, and shops not too far away for anything else you need. I left behind some keys and the front desk clerk called me 30 minutes after I left, fortunately I hadn't gotten too far down the road so I could come back to get them!"
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,5,Pleasant stay,"With the price, and with 4 kids tagging along, it was a pleasant stay! The front desk guy was Jermaine (if I recall correctly), and he was nice and very helpful. The lady at the breakfast station was also nice. In fact all the hotel staff that I met was nice and helpful."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,3,Nice hotel very clean,The front desk staff was not good. Tried to leave a wakeup call two nights in a row. Went down to the front desk about 9 pm could not find anyone. Checked out at 4:30 am no one at desk or available.
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,3,No blankets,"There were no towels or blankets in our room. When I called the front desk, they made me come down to pick up the towels. They said that they were out of blankets. Really How does a hotel run out of blankets I guess someone was on vacation when the need to order more blankets was supposed to be placed."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,4,Great Stay,My family and I stayed at the Comfort Suites and had a great stay. The staff had a great attitude towards everyone who stayed. My family and I were treated great and were well taken care of. I recommend the Comfort Suites to anyone staying for a long period of time or for a night.
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,3,No food and possible bed bugs...,"We were there to just stop for a night on our way to the outer banks... although I will admit that our drive down was horrible, so we may have been more sensitive than normal, but this place had zero options for food or drinks. In addition, we were going to have our son just sleep on the floor, but my husband saw bugs all over the side wall... For the upcharged price, this is a no go in future. Will sleep in car next time and save 200"
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,5,great getaway,"Great little getaway for our anniversary. Bed was comfortable, staff very nice and friendly, room very clean. Would stay again soon."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,4,Comfortable Lodging,"New hotel in a new housing subdivision. Very close to relative's home. No food available, after continental breakfast. Nicely decorated."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,3,Quiet location,"We were visiting family in Portsmouth, so this location was convenient for us. The hotel is on a street off the highway and by itself, so it is a quiet location with field and woods views in the back. On our first morning, the breakfast buffet had no food left by 8:30AM, so we had to wait more than 30 minutes to get anything to eat. On our third day, when we arrived back from the beach around 3PM our key cards would not open our door. When we did get new cards, we found our room had not been cleaned and only one towel was left for all of us to shower. In spite of the glitches, we would use this hotel again."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,5,Kid friendly,Breakfast wasn't te best but beside that everything else was perfect. They supplied us with an extra crib and crib sheet. Help with any question we had and the staff was extremely generous.
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,5,excellent hotel,"Very happy all around, would highly recommend"
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,4,Overall nice stay,"Place was decent. The AC wasn't the best, but other than that the stay was comfortable."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,4,Enjoyed!,"I arrived a little earlier being I had been driving all night. I was ready to check into my room, but I had forgot that check-in time was at 3pm. I ask the desk clerk would it be ok if I could sit and wait the next 3 hrs in the lobby and she said yes. Well I guess she saw how tired I looked, she was nice enough to check with housekeeping to see if a room was ready. She allowed me to check in early and I am very grateful to her. Well I also want to commend the staff name Andre who were very helpful to make sure my stay at the hotel was satisfactory! Breakfast was stock when I went down and I was very please with the staff professionalism. I always stay at this hotel when I am in Suffolk, Va. Great Job"
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,4,Quick overnight stay.,"My sister I were only in town for a day so we didn't need a lot of service when we were at the hotel. However, it did meet our requirements. The room was very clean, the woman at the front desk was polite professional when we checked in. We were very pleased with our short little stay. All we every ask is that the rooms are clean, the staff is respectful, it to be quiet. I will say that there were a lot of children. I don't know if this hotel is a vacation destination hotel because the amount of children was a little daunting. Granted, it is summer they do have a pool. The halls were still fairly quiet while we were on our way to check out, the room next to ours had a bunch of children in it we never had a problem with the noise level so I think it's safe to say the walls are pretty thick."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,3,For our needs it suited,"The rooms were clean, but the hotel was more functional than inviting. The pool was small and always occupied(if more then 7 people in was crowded, it seemed) so we did not use it. Our family lived close by so it was convenient but is in middle of nowhere(although the area is being built up) if the feel was less functional and more inviting then I would have given 5's the breakfast was worth the extra money I paid for the rooms(as compared to another hotel without it)."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,5,Departing Navy,It was great ...location and very friendly and clean
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,3,Its better options for same price,"Friendly hotel staff (99) and a lot of food options with 5 mins or so. But the entire hotel smells musty and needs updating. Beds are HORRIBLE, 3rd shift front desk unpleasant/lazy, and with VA traffic you're more like 45 mins from the beach."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,3,good for the price,"The price was really good, but I was disappointed when I checked in and they did not have the room I booked. I booked a king and all they could give me was two doubles. They said I could move the next day, but I decided to stay in my same room rather than packing everything back up again. The room was definitely in need of some maintenance, but nothing major. I would stay there again, as long as I get the room I actually book next time."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,2,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed with this hotel. The front desk clerk was rude and put my family in a dirty room (beds were not made, one of the pictures was pulled off of the wall and food still in the room). I then had to switch rooms and clerk seemed annoyed that I was unhappy with the status of my room."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,4,nice hotel!,not bad at all. no complaints
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,5,Best 80 bucks ever spent,I've stayed at numerous hotels over the past year and this room was by far the best. The room came with sofa and office space in addition to the king size bed. Surely I will stay there again.
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,5,Great Stay All Around,I loved the hotel very clean comfortable! Great staff will stay again if im ever in the area!
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,5,Excellent room for the money,"The atmosphere of the hotel was excellent! Every staff worker that I encountered was extremely friendly and helpful! They were very informative as well in terms of the early continental breakfast that they serve and were all the amenities are located! The fitness center and the indoor heated pool and jacuzzi were very clean as well as my room. Overall, this was an enjoyable stay for me and I highly recommend this hotel to others. You will definitely be satisfied!"
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,4,Great room!,"The room was incredible. King bed and sleeper sofa, fill sized desk with real office chair, kitchen type area with mini sink. Ceilings must have been at least 16' high. Gave the room a nice grandiose feel. Only disappointment was at breakfast when we were told they had run out of waffle batter the day before. There were other options, but not the same."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,4,comfort inn and suites Harborview,"This hotel is clean and well kept. It looks to be newer than it actually is. It is convenient to stores and restaurants. The staff is friendly and courteous. The rooms are a good size. I found the pillows to be small and too soft for my liking. The only room available was for special needs, this was not expected. it lacked a bath tub. but the shower was ok. None of the soda machines worked correctly. It is not to close to the beach and there is no view of the harbor."
Comfort Suites Suffolk - Chesapeake,5,Loved it!,Great room! Plenty of space for 4 people
Hampton Inn Newport News-Yorktown,4,Great place to stay,"We were in area for a memorial service, so room booked on short notice. This Hampton was at a good location with shopping close by,also near major highways but yet secluded. We found the staff pleasant helpful, hotel was updated and rooms were clean nice but average size. Breakfast at this hotel was exceptional for motels/hotels."
Hampton Inn Newport News-Yorktown,5,Stayover for business,Came to stay on way home from Baltimore- testing for husband- and had to meet in moyock NC. So decided rather then drive to OBX and turn around and drive back we stayed in Newport News. The staff was very nice- the room quiet and comfortable- and the area good for eats and shopping.
Hampton Inn Newport News-Yorktown,4,Alright for the price breakfast could be better,The hotel was nice for the price the hot breakfast could have been better the food tasted like it was all made in the microwave. Which ot probably was it is just that scrambled eggs made in the microwave do not taste very good.
Hampton Inn Newport News-Yorktown,5,"As always, Hampton inn was superb.",I enjoyed the stay. The hotel was very convenient to our needs.
Hampton Inn Newport News-Yorktown,5,Off the planet service!,"I've stayed here several times and the service here is always above and beyond the call of duty.Clean rooms,great breakfast bar and we love Helen to death! Highly recommend this rest stop! 5 stars! You will be glad you stayed here!"

Hampton Inn Middletown,4,Superseded My Stay Expectations.,"Overall the staff, hotel cleanliness and the amenities like breakfast was up to my satisfaction. Even though the Hotel had signs apologizing for renovations I am so happy that we didn't hear or had any complaints concerning the renovations. We didn't even notice the people or rooms being renovated. My stay was enjoyable with piece and quiet all around just like I love my stays. The only complaint which wasn't a big issue for me was the slow internet service provided. Although it was complimentary free wifi, I think I would of paid a few dollars for quicker faster internet wifi services on my stay. No biggie if you don't need it. The bed was more comfortable than I had expected I give you guys 5stars on comfort and cleanliness! I will be coming back here on my next stay!"
Hampton Inn Middletown,5,would return,"the staff very helpful and accommodating throughout the entire stay, breakfast was excellent and rooms were clean. pool was nice and clean and environment as a whole was very comfortable in feeling. location was close to much activities to participate in"
Hampton Inn Middletown,5,Winety Weekend Getaway,A perfect location for a weekend excursion from NYC. This hotel is approximately 20 mins from two NY wineries one being the Brotherhood Winery which is the oldest in the USA. This Hampton Inn has a delightful all-American all-you-eat breakfast buffet. This Inn is a great value for your money and the location. Also pet-friendly.
Hampton Inn Middletown,5,Luxury for us and our dog!,"This is NOT your typical hotel that allows pets. It is exactly what you'd expect from the Hilton/Hampton brand. Clean, lovely dcor and bedding. I highly recommend this motel and wish there were more like it so we could travel with our pet without lowering our expectations."
Hampton Inn Middletown,4,An older hotel with nice rooms,I stayed there for a week on business. There are three hotels and 4-5 restaurants right off of the expressway. The room was nice. The staff was friendly even when while I was leaving and I accidentally dropped a large bag of MMs all over the lobby near the elevators.
Hampton Inn Middletown,3,ANDREW SAVED US,"This comment is solely based on the Customer Service provided by the night time attendant (ANDREW) that checked us in. I am positive that had Andrew not provided the service when and how he did, I would have called 311 to express my discomfort (caused by other hotel guest) and demanded a complete refund. Andrew the Pena Family thanks you for your understanding and professionalism. -dez"
Quality Inn,4,Orange City Quality Inn,The motel has a pool and exercise room. The breakfast bar was 1st class. Everyone that I had any dealings with were top notch.
Quality Inn,4,Business trip,"Business trip, stay was pleasant and convenient"
Quality Inn,2,So so,"Confusing and less than desirable internet, front desk was no help. Room was so so. my particular room had an a/c that smelled like a dirty foot but perhaps it's just that room. Granite by rest room was weirdly stained, I'm not sure how that happens"
Quality Inn,1,Disgusting! Quality Inn What a misnomer!!!,"We booked this room through Hotwire for 1 night. We paid 162.

Who knows how many others were lurking elsewhere! So, we called the... More"

Best Western Suites Near Opryland,4,Christmas outing,My wife and I decided to get out of town and take in a Christmas Opryland show. We stayed at the Best Western nearby to avoid the expensive Opryland Hotel. The hotel was good (old but remodeled). The neighborhood was a hotel wasteland--totally not walkable.
Best Western Suites Near Opryland,5,Comfortable & Appealing,"I like the face-lift on the property. It felt like a new hotel. The breakfast was great ! Overall, it was comfortable."
Best Western Suites Near Opryland,1,weirdest hotel stay experience,"We travel fairly often and stayed in a lot of hotels. This is the most strange experience we have ever had (in a bad way).

Best Western Suites Near Opryland,4,Nice place to stay,This was a very clean nice place to stay and it is very close to the grand ole opry as well as downtown Nashville. I would recomend staying here if you do not mind a short drive to downtown and an easy cab ride to Opryland. There are several nice places to eat in the area as well.
Best Western Suites Near Opryland,5,Stay here!,We stay at this hotel any time we go to Nashville. Friendly Staff.. very nice rooms... good price. We love being close to so many nice restaurants and the Opry Mills Mall! We stay here with our children and their families every Thanksgiving weekend. Perfect for us!!!!
Best Western Suites Near Opryland,3,"Decent hotel, but had some issues...","We stayed here with family for a long pre-Christmas weekend in Nashville. Located in fairly close proximity of Opryland, the Opryland Mills outlet mall, and the Gaylord Opryland Convention Center, as well as close to a slew of restaurants, it is a convenient location and is a fairly easy area to navigate. It also can be challenging due to traffic,... More"
Best Western Suites Near Opryland,5,Clean Quiet,"This was a nice clean, quiet facility with a larger room that I expected. We will come back and stay here again. The location was very handy for Opry Mills shopping without the expense of some other facilities."
Best Western Suites Near Opryland,4,Room Service,Only thing I didn't like was they didn't take dirty cups until my second day. And I had to ask for clean cups and coffee.
Fairfield Inn Tracy,5,Amazing Staff,"The staff is amazing and always helpful. So far I have definitely enjoyed my stay. Traveling with my company we have to share a vehicle, but the location of the hotel is within walking distance of many restaurants and the West Valley Mall. For me this hotel gets 2 thumbs up from me for location combined with a superior staff,... More"
Fairfield Inn Tracy,4,Solid hotel,"The Fairfield Inn Tracy is located close to the highway. Therefore road noise can be heard. However, the hotel is clean and the staff is excellent. The noise will not wake you or annoy you but it is there. Close to shopping and restaurants. The Hampton Inn is across the parking lot and has the same noise issue."
Vagabond Inn Sunnyvale,3,Modest but nice,"Overall our stay was very nice, the room was clean and housekeeping was great about providing new towels/sheets/paper etc... The guy at the front desk had a terrible attitude but it might've been because he was working the overnight shift . All in all we enjoyed our stay and got to stay for 3 nights for a reasonable price 314"
Vagabond Inn Sunnyvale,3,decent motel close to downtown,"This is a decent motel The staff is very friendly the breakfast is quite sparse compared to some other places at similar prices. Since there is no place to eat it they don't mind you taking something back to the room which I recommend over standing there at the front desk. All motels in Sunnyvale are expensive compared to similar places elsewhere so we have to factor that in to the price. I have stayed twice recently. All the rooms are not equal. The first one on second floor was a bit nicer because of the layout. The one downstairs in the back was more convenient for luggage, but the room layout was weird and not as comfortable. The immediate location is not great in terms of walking (there is only a Denny's next door), but its 5 minutes from downtown if you have a car."
Vagabond Inn Sunnyvale,3,Basic room,Basic room. Staff was nice and helpful. No lock on bathroom door. No hair dryer. Mini fridge in room clicked loudly and had to unplug to sleep. Denny's in parking lot which I originally counted as a plus attracted people leaving clubs at 2 am making the parking lot very noisy on Saturday night. AC worked well.
Vagabond Inn Sunnyvale,4,Business Stay,"Nice room, looked to be in the last stages of a renovation. I would stay there again. Charged for a safe but was unable to locate it. There room had hardwood floors which is something new to me in a hotel experience."
Holiday Inn Express & Suites Sioux Falls Southwest,5,Great surprise,"I really enjoyed my stay here for one night. The room was large and very comfortable, with a kitchenette (fridge, coffee machine, microwave, sink), desk and living room. The staff was pleasant and provided a shuttle to and from the airport if needed. Ample parking space. Breakfast was included and had plenty to choose from and lots of seating."
BEST WESTERN Garden Inn,5,Refreshing,"We liked the garden feeling of the one story rooms in the back near the pool. Very lovely and quiet. Nice big trees around. Also, there was a lot of counter space in the bathroom which was handy. We thought of staying somewhere that cost less, read reviews and decided to go ahead and stay here instead. Good idea. You...

BEST WESTERN Garden Inn,4,Old School Motor Inn,This is is fine old motor inn - old school with the parking lot in the middle.

BEST WESTERN Garden Inn,3,Disappointed as a BW Gold card holder,"Room was too expensive. No full or continental breakfast. Staff a bit laid back. Breakfast was offered on site, but you paid for it.

BEST WESTERN Garden Inn,3,Santa Rosa Get-a-way....,"Overall this Best Western is nicely decorated. It was a bit disappointing that the bathroom did not function. A fairly busy property, so repairs were slow. The plus if you need or want to be close to 101. It is minutes from the freeway. Very convenient, if you are traveling to the Northern California's Redwoods or Sonoma/Napa."

Hotel Maya - a DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,5,Getaway,"Great place to just separate yourself from the hustle of Los Angeles. They over exceeded all expectations.

Hotel Maya - a DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,1,worst experience ever,"I hate to give a bad review but this was such a bad experience i would hate for anyone to go through what i did.

Already irritated from check in, now this chick, we changed our minds and said we can order room service... got some food that took an hour to arrive and it was not the best for 100, 3 tacos a quesadilla 2 salds and 2 cokes. We then decided to go for a walk that was nice with beautiful views, we started feeling good after some wine and craved a cigar... know there is no stores close by you have to go back accross the bridge in your car to get anything like that.

Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,4.6,Carpet,Bad: Carpet Breakfast was starting to be boring at the end.
Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,3.55,Was ok. Just ok.,Bad: No description of the complimentary shuttle service to universal. One shuttle per day leaves at 735 am.

Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,3.35,Reasonable,"Bad: In my opinion, the carpet needs to be replaced or cleaned urgently. It left an unpleasant musty smell in the room. I changed the room and the smell remained. After walking barefoot on the carpet and stepping into the tub, there were black dirt tracks in the tub.

It is close to Disney parks and about 20 drive to Universal parks and the airport. There is also free parks shuttle service provided."
Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,2.5,Friendly staff,"Bad: Hotel should be in the motel category considering the room we've got.

Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,1.25,Do not stay here cars broken into on property and hotel doesn't care,Bad: Please take heed to this warning do not stay here. My car along with 3 other guest cars staying at this hotel were broken into overnight. The hotel didnt try to make us feel more safe or accommodate us.. They do not care at all. If you are trying to save money dont chance it by staying here unless you want your car broken into and you want your property stolen. It's not worth it you are better off staying in another hotel. This ruined our trip and we didn't feel safe staying there and management doesnt care at all also.. There is no security gaurds or cameras on this property so ask yourself if you want to be next. .

Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,4.8,Our Disney/Universal vacation.,Bad: Breakfast could have been better. Who likes fake eggs and turkey sausage A bit nasty! We were on third floor when we needed 2- 1st floor rooms. There were a lot of empty 1st floor rooms. A lot of stairs with a lot of luggage and 1 grandma who has leg problems. Good: Beds were great. Very comfortable. Hotel was very clean. Staff was very helpful. Room cleaners did a great job! We were in rooms 339 and 340 for a week. Never saw any bugs! Plenty of towels!
Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,2.5,Wouldnt recommend.,"Bad: Room smelled, mattress was thin and hard. Clerk changed my rate to higher price when we arrived saying we got wrong rate. Charged more than was quoted on booking. Gave us a map and I guess they get a lot of complaints because it says FYI hotel built on 1989. Bring your own toiletries. Very little lighting in room and no electric plugs. Everything was plugged into an extension cord. Good: Location and parking."
Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,4.4,The room was a good size and had tea and coffee making tray.,"Bad: There was no non slip surface in the bath or any grab rails in the bathroom, my husband slipped and fell out of the bath while having a shower.

Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,5,Convenient location to ESPN Wide World of Sports,Our room was handicapped accessible yet was located in the most obscure corner of the building on the third floor as far from the elevators as one could get.

Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,5,Would highly recommend.,"Bad: There wasn't anything I didn't like. Good: All staff was very nice and extremely accommodating. The entire property was clean and well kept. The room was clean when we arrived and housekeeping came every morning to clean and verify all was well and if we needed any additional towels, toiletries etc. Their breakfast area was clean, the food was hot and fresh and there was plenty food to go around. I read some guests didn't like the breakfast voucher system but my husband and I liked them because we have stayed at other hotels where there is more people in the breakfast area than there is food. Their Wifi went down while at their business center, they informed me that the system was running slow and that their service provider was on property trying to fix it. I let them know that I was in the middle of a Disney ticket purchase and the front desk staff immediately got their own personal Hotspot set up on their front desk computer. They let me finish my Disney ticket purchase/transaction from their desk....yes from their desk... which i didn't expect. I was really happy cause that saved us alot of time and hassle. The hotel is close to WDW and plenty of dinning. It was overall a wonderful stay, nothing to complain about...other that they could accommodate me the extra day we decide to stay, but that was our fault since we did it last minute. Would HIGHLY recommend."

Pool was always clean and heated."
Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,2.9,Nice to JUST SLEEP watch tv,"Bad: Very old hotel. Front desk not very pleasant, never smiled! Isn't that their job description Happily welcome guests as the hotel ambassadors. They just talked amongst themselves. Breakfast was obviously cheap unfrozen. Nothing FRESH, except old fruit overly-processed waffle mix. Tub was gross towels had hair stuck to it. Very small front desk/common/breakfast area, pictures are decieving. Good: Location was amazing, next to easiest Magic Kingdom entrance! Room was clean enough. Choice hotels update done, TVs, bedspreads... The building is very pretty, not cookie cutter. We didn't use pool, gym nor office but pictures looked okay."

Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,4.4,Good access to Disney theme parks,Bathroom disproportionately small compared to the rest of the room Hot breakfast of scrambled eggs and patties left a lot to be desired The theme park shuttle service was a disappointment only a handful of departures a day at not at all convenient times. We only took the shuttle once had to use Uber the rest of the time which was a pity cos I booked this hotel based on the free shuttle service to theme parks marketing Beds were huge and comfy Very friendly and helpful staff Location was good for access to Disney theme parks
Quality Inn and Suites By The Parks,4.8,Great for families on a budget looking for quality,"Bad: Little bit boring breakfast..but is relative to yhe nightly rate. Good: Nice clean, good pool,great price 15mins to all attractions"

"Bluegreen Vacations Patrick Henry Sqr, Ascend Resort Collection",5,Overall we had a good trip and will use this property again.,Bad: We had a ground unit and was unable to sleep until 11 pm every night because of the family above us had a kid that ran from 7 am to 11 pm for 3 nights. Suggestion: Put families with small kids on ground unit and that way we will all be comfort. Also requested early check in and wasnt assigned unit until 5 pm.
"Bluegreen Vacations Patrick Henry Sqr, Ascend Resort Collection",4.15,Good value but too many things went wrong or were wrong.,"Bad: Rooms not ready when they said they were. Walls too thin and so it was noisy,. Could not get hot water in shower and the elevator broke. Also no corkscrew or cheese cutter which should be included.

Best Western Inn & Suites At Discovery Kingdom,5,So many positives,The hotel was great and just a block away from Discovery Kingdom. They have a shuttle that takes you from the hotel to the park and picks you up later. This will save you 25 a day in parking. The breakfast buffet was a great way to start your day. They have coffee and cold water for you at the lobby 24hrs so that is also a plus. The rooms are spacious with sofa beds and the staff is very friendly. This is a great value and an awesome place for a family trip.
Best Western Inn & Suites At Discovery Kingdom,4,"Quiet, simple","I've stayed at this hotel twice both times in November. Perhaps it's just because it's a slow season in that area, both times I got a GREAT sleep. Peace and quiet and a clean room is all I ask.

Hilton Garden Inn Winchester,4,A good stopover,"The Winchester Hilton Garden Inn was our last stop after a couple of weeks traveling across the US before arriving in New York.

Hilton Garden Inn Edison/Raritan Center,5,Hilton at Raritan Center is excellent,Free parking ! Very clean room and hotel. Friendly staff. We will definitely stay here again.
Hilton Garden Inn Edison/Raritan Center,3,Have some etiquette,This Hotel was clean and well kept.. However because I have children they put me on the Same floor as other children. I was woken up many times throughout the night by screaming children and they were not my own!It was very loud throughout the night of people talking and running up and down the hallways! I was quite disturbed by this. Overall the room was comfortable just very loud and obnoxious people that happened to stay there which is unfortunate.
Hilton Garden Inn Edison/Raritan Center,4,"Quiet, comfortable hotel","Spacious and clean room. Very comfortable and firm bed with down pillows and comforter. We had no problem connecting to the free WiFi. Little luxuries in the room included a Keurig machine, k-cups and a mini fridge. We arrived after 1:00 AM and someone was still at the front desk to greet us. There is a nice little area next to the front desk where they sell snacks, drinks (including beer) and basic toiletry items. The indoor pool is open 6:00am - 11:00pm - didn't get to experience it but it looked very nice - there is also a hot tub. Made reservation for a smoking room however, the entire building is smoke free FYI. There is breakfast served next to the lobby area in the morning - there is a continental breakfast (6.95) or a breakfast buffet (9.95). We had the buffet and it was very good - you can order custom omelets and they had biscuits, sausage gravy, bacon, sausage, grits and eggs all hot and ready. There is also milk, juice, and soda available. We also liked the late check-out time (12 noon) since we got in so late. We would definitely stay here again - overall, very happy we picked this hotel!"
Hilton Garden Inn Edison/Raritan Center,5,great location for Raritan Center,I have stayed at this Hilton Garden Inn a few times. It has a very convenient location to the Raritan Center and many restaurant options. It is always clean and the staff is excellent. The hot tub is really hot.

Best Western Plus Wilmington/Carolina Beach,5,Clean and great indoor pool and hot tub!,My kids loved the pool. I loved the hot tub and the fitness area. My kids really enjoyed breakfast. Convenient location. Close to the beach. Great for the price. I will be back again. The rewards program is a great perk!
Best Western Plus Wilmington/Carolina Beach,2,Worst,"Dirty room,uncomfortable beds, tv remote didnt work, no parking space"
Best Western Plus Wilmington/Carolina Beach,5,Rude front desk man,The front desk man was very rude. If I didn't like the indoor pool I would never go back again. He was very arrogant and acted as if he didn't care if our stay was enjoyable. Told me false information and made it difficult for me to check in.They need to rehire a new front desk person if I ever see him again I'm turning the other way.
The Chateau Motel,1,STAY far away from this place,Booked over the phone. Asked if they were pet friendly and the lady said yes. Drove 5 hours to get here and then be told no cats allowed. Would not cancel nor refund the reservation. Called my bank to stop payment and dispute the charge. Very unfriendly staff. Not a good experience
The Chateau Motel,3,Try to get a room thats not facing the pool!,"A little shabby but you get what you pay for. Upside was the beach being right behind the motel.They did have nightly events such as movie night, live DJ. Also the view from the balcony was beautiful! They have a pretty nice pool also."

The Chateau Motel,3,Decent Stay on the Beach!,This was the only place we could find at the last minute when everything was booked up and we couldn't understand why until we got here.

The Chateau Motel,4,Good stay for a few days,We arrived at the Chateau around 11:00 a.m. and they told us to come back at 1:00 for pre-registration.

Courtyard Harrisburg Hershey,5,Lovely Hotel,Stayed for the weekend and the only thing I would change is that a free continental breakfast would be nice. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Harrisburg.

Days Inn Apple Valley Sevierville,3,"Nothing Special, Its Cheap","Very outdated rooms. Beds are hard as a rock.

Almost every hotel in the area has had their pool open for 2 weeks, but not... More"
Days Inn Apple Valley Sevierville,2,Shabby,"Sadly in need of total facelift. Not so clean, beds comfy but in need of linen update. Old TV. Kind of felt like I needed to check for crawlies. You get what you pay for. Would not return and would not recommend."
Days Inn Apple Valley Sevierville,5,Review Days Inn,"We recently stayed at Days Inn, Apple Valley, Sevierville, TN for 4 nights and had no problems and if did staff took care off. Emily and maintenance man are the best as is the rest of the staff who are for the most part. Convenient location-close to everything and get what you pay for. We'll be back next year."
Holiday Inn Express Harrisburg East,3,Reasonably close to Hershey Park,Stayed here for our trip to Hershey Park. My son loved the nice and warm pool. Friendly staff and very close to restaurants and grocery store.
Holiday Inn Express Harrisburg East,3,It was adequate.,The lobby and breakfast area were very nice and clean. The girl at the desk was very friendly. However my non smoking room reaked of smoke and we found a container of chewing tobacco in the bedside table. My three-year-old also pulled out two 2 x 4 is from underneath the bed. The bathroom was clean.
Holiday Inn Express Harrisburg East,4,Hershey park stay,Great for a short stay close to all
Holiday Inn Express Harrisburg East,4,Sweet Dreams,"Visiting Hershey, was looking for a hotel close enough without the expense.

Holiday Inn Express Harrisburg East,3,Smells awful,"The room smelled horrible...like stale cigarette smoke and mold. Other than the smell, they gave me the handicapped room with a shower that floods the floor. Besides these 2 things, the room was fine. I will never stay here again."
Holiday Inn Express Harrisburg East,5,"A comfortable, relaxing overnight","We had a quick overnight stay here while traveling from Atlanta to Boston. At the end of a 12 hour day in the car, this was a great place to pull into! The woman at the front desk was extremely nice, the room was very clean, and the beds were super comfy. Bonus, they are pet friendly, and it can be hard to find a place that will take 2 dogs. I would definitely stay here again."
Holiday Inn Express Harrisburg East,5,Good value and convenient.,"This hotel met all of expectations. Great breakfast, good value and convenient location."
Holiday Inn Express Harrisburg East,2,very unfriendly front desk personnel,"Wendy at the front desk was very unfridently. The hallway at the floor was dirty. TV in the room was not working, no channel. Wendy was not accommodate customer's need at all, Over half hour tried to fix the TV with no success. Ask for Change room, she said no. Even at the beginning, Wendy told us plenty of room available."
AC Hotel Miami Beach,5,Excelent stay and courteous staff at the AC Hotel Miami,"A recent stay in early April 2016 was most enjoyable. The property is beautifully appointed, with cool, industrial, minimalist decor and an unbeatable location in South Beach. The rooftop pool is beautiful.

Quality Inn,4,3 Day Road trip to Up North,"Nice Rooms very homey feel. Pictures on walls are very interested. Check in area is really cool has a lot of Up North stuff. Restraunt is home cookin, good food, spirits, nice people. Dinners are better than Breakfast."
Quality Inn,3,Ok for the area but overpriced,"Had a king room--asked for one not facing the indoor pool.

My room was superficially clean. The dust ruffle had dirt marks on... More"
Wingate by Wyndham San Marcos,3,Not too impressed,"Our room smelled like smoke, and they had no other rooms to offer us. I found a spider in the bed when I rolled back the sheets to go to bed.

Comfort Inn & Suites West,5,Very nice near Portland,"We stayed two nights here while in town to visit with our son that lives in the area. The hotel was excellent.

Red Roof Inn Fresno - Yosemite Gateway,1,Beyond Filthy,"This place was worse than terrible! I reserved my dad a room for a funeral and i have to say that it was the worst place I've ever seen! The place was beyond filthy and smelly! They didn't even try to hide the filth, my brother found bed bugs in his room and decided to leave! Bottom line, STAY AWAY!!!!"
Red Roof Inn Fresno - Yosemite Gateway,3,Pretty good,"This is a clean hotel.but the smell is not so good, the breakfast is ok."
Red Roof Inn Fresno - Yosemite Gateway,1,Terrible!,Mold in bathroom. Blankets had fur balls (old). Klennex box rusted. AC loud. The property had old decor. Will not be returning to the property. I will not be returning to Red Roof Inn. If this is how they run their inns I will stay somewhere else.
Red Roof Inn Fresno - Yosemite Gateway,5,The front desk and housekeeping is really nice,When I checked in the front desk staff was really helpful and nice they upgraded me rooms because they were out of 2 queen size beds and they let me know at check in so when I went into the room the beds were so big my kids loved it because they had a big bed and the room was...

Continental breakfast ok. All night, as we checked in late, people,guests outside smoking and littering their cigarette butts all over. Don't recomend!"
Red Roof Inn Fresno - Yosemite Gateway,1,Sleep in the street...it's better than this dump.,I have never been to such a place in my life. The room needs a deep clean or totally revamped.

We complained again only to be told that... More
Red Roof Inn Fresno - Yosemite Gateway,1,Worst Hotel I have ever book on Expedia!!!!!!!!!!!,Stay away from this place. It is a dirty roach Motel!! It seems like the place is more like low income housing for homeless people and drug users then a hotel for tourists-visitors. The rooms were dirty and smelled. There were people smoking weed and doing drugs in the parking lot. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
Red Roof Inn Fresno - Yosemite Gateway,1,I would rather sleep in my car!,"The room was big and bed comfortable. Everything else was bad. Dirty, no hot water. Poor TV reception. Spotty wifi. Moldy hallway. Dangerous neighborhood. Bkfst only for tour groups. Faucets poor condition. Couch stained and baggy. Rug stained. Hole in door screen. Road under construction. Etc. etc."
Best Western Springfield,5,Great stay,We had a problem with our air conditioning in the air and they were unable to fix it so they moved us to a new room even though the hotel was completely booked. It was a great place to stay overnight and very close to the auto train. Great staff!
Best Western Springfield,5,Ottimo servizio,Colazione abbondante e con molta scelta. Camere pulite.
Best Western Springfield,5,Hospitality and comfort,"The hotel staff was very helpful, especially traveling around the greater DC area and shopping and eating establishments."
Best Western Springfield,3,Gunstiges Hotel U-Bahn Nahe,"Fruhstuck inklusive, zwar grosse Auswahl, allerdings in Pappbechern und Papptellern in Selbstbedienung ! Es gibt einen Aussenpool, der in der heissen Saison hilfreich ist, allerdings nicht sonderlich schon gepflegt."
Best Western Springfield,3,Smelled like smoke and Room was dirty,"When I opened the door to my room the trash can was on the floor with garbage from it on the floor. There were big cigar or cigarette ashes on one bed and an aluminum beer can on the entertainment center. The room smelled like cigarette smoke. I called down to the front desk and she apologized emphatically and I went down to get another room key. Mind you I was with my family of 4, 2 small kids in tow. The second room was appeared clean however it still smelled like cigarette smoke. The only good thing about this hotel was the beds were comfy and the hot water lasted long enough for my family of four to take showers. continental breakfast was alright, but it was complimentary so, I cant complain. We stayed a total of 6 nights, but only because I had already prepaid. If I had not, we would have moved to another hotel."
Best Western Springfield,4,Great hotel with good price and value,We are quite happy with our choice. The receptionists are generally friendly and helpful. We found it convenient to have a courtesy van. The breakfast is very good.
Best Western Springfield,2,Just the basics,"First of all, I read these reviews alot and I am always suprised at how picky some people are. We are not that way and are usually looking for something that is a good deal even if it's not the greatest hotel. Having said that, this is my review. Got into the hotel at 11:30 at night after 11 hours of driving to find that the air conditioning in our room did not work. The front desk clerk was extremely rude and very difficult to work with, however a security/maintence guy was more than helpful and after about 45 minutes we were transfered to a new room. The hotel is extremely basic if that is what you are looking for. It is in the middle of roads and highways and overpasses and really has no character at all. If you are looking for a one or two night stay at a cheap price it's not too bad. The hotel does have a decent free breakfast, but if it gets to busy, it is very chaotic, crowded and dirty. There are several other hotels nearby that I would try first if we ever came to DC again."
Best Western Springfield,4,Very accommodating to meet my needs.,"I lost my confirmation number and they couldn't find my reservation, but they gave me a room I booked at the price I was quoted at. Breakfast was good and restaurant area was clean. Housekeeping was great and on cue. Came back to a clean room and fresh towels every day."
Best Western Springfield,3,OK but I would stay elsewhere if give the choice,This hotel has a very strange layout and my room and the hallway smelled mildewy. But it seemed very clean otherwise and the staff was very nice. The breakfast buffet was pretty good. The free shuttle to the Metro turned out to cost 10 not sure if the driver and the hotel have that understanding or not.
Best Western Springfield,4,"Helpful staff, free shuttle to Metro, good price","Very friendly staff and good location (free parking and free shuttle). Nearby highway overpass and road noise was a concern on my side of the hotel, but it is convenient, clean, inexpensive, and with very friendly and helpful desk staff -- they are so nice!"
Best Western Springfield,5,Pleasantly surprised,"After stopping over for one night in another city on the way to Springfield and being very disappointed in that hotel (Super 8), I was tempted to cancel my reservations here, but when we checked in, we were all pleasantly surprised and very satisfied with the rooms - very clean, helpful and polite staff, good hot/cold breakfast, etc. I had reserved two rooms (myself husband and in-laws). We checked in Tues and out on Sat - no problems at all. We would definitely stay at this hotel again."
Best Western Springfield,3,WEEKEND STAY AT BEST WESTERN,STAFF MEMBERS WERE NICE. QUIET PLACE .TOOK A WHILE TO GET CHECKED IN. THE ROOMS GOT A LITTLE MUSTY I GUESS DUE TO BAD VENTILATION. OVERALL STAY WAYS OK. BELOW MY EXPECTION
Best Western Springfield,5,Great DC vacation hotel!!,"Excellent, clean hotel with great, included breakfast and friendly, helpful staff."
Best Western Springfield,5,Great place to stay if you want to go to DC,"The room was good and on the opposite side of the highway and low (2nd floor) as we heard others say something about the highway noise. The breakfast and shuttle saved us a ton of money and time. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is the same everyday but there is enough of a variety if you stay long it won't get boring. The shuttle will take you within 3 miles and the DC Metro station is within this range. They start at 6:30 am if you wan to get an early start but they had 3 different vans so we had no wait anytime we wanted to leave. Short wait when you called for pick-up but not long. No parking hassles in DC (15+ a day or at the Metro station (5 a day). It was hot (100+) so the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC."
Best Western Springfield,4,Tres bon rapport qualite / prix,Hotel un peu eloigne de la ville mais navette efficace et chauffeur sympa. Piscine appreciee avec les grosses chaleurs.
Best Western Springfield,3,Needs some help!!!!,"Got off to a rocky start as the room was not ready at our check in time, guaranteed late check in. This was at 10pm on a Sunday night! The lobby was full of customers who could not check in also, at least 7 different reservations where being held up. Front desk staff had to leave check the rooms to see if they had been cleaned at 10:30! Thankful, my room was ready by then, not sure how the others made out as I wasn't sticking around to hear the complaints. The breakfast consist of powered scrambled eggs, powered egg cheese omelette, under or over cooked bacon, link or patty sausage (only one meat a day, fruit that was not fresh, and broken waffle, coffee, other machines during the week. It's food with zero taste. One of the two elevators has been out of service for the entire 8 days I have been here. The maids did do a good job cleaning the room every day. The picture on the website for the pool is a straight out lie yes, it has a pool, and no, it is only a average to small pool in size. More than 15 guest at any times makes it a little jammed. Overall, it's a room a bed."
Best Western Springfield,2,Worst hotel I have stayed,"Terribly managed hotel. Probably the worst hotel I have stayed in a while. Arrived late in the evening and found a que of guests trying to check in. One family with four kids apparently had booked two rooms via Expedia only to be told they had only one room with a king bed available. The two guys behind the counter had no clue what to do - listening to their phone conversation with (apparently) their manager, it seems they had a number of free rooms - but those had not been cleaned and where dirty. They also made everyone pay a 200 security fee - which upset several of the guests trying to check in. My room was prepaid and I did not have that problem. However, I needed to go three times up to my room on the 6th floor because the key card did not work - they then switched me to another room. The door of the first room had clear signs of an attempted break in. Since they could give me another room, why did they not give another one for this family Room was ok but smelled moldy. Breakfast was poor and breakfast room pretty dirty and unpleasant. To sum it up, I do not recommend this hotel. Should have chosen the Courtyard Marriott across the street instead - eventhoug it is a little more expensive. Other folks in my group stayed there - I should have done the same."
Best Western Springfield,2,Can be improved on,Dear Sir/Madam I arrived closer to 23h00 the first night. I was first assigned Room 421 which after spending some time there realised that the main lights were not working and the toilet appeared to be clogged - also found a sweetener paper wrap in the toilet. I was then assigned Room 418 - none of the lights in main area and then finally got Room 426 well past midnight. The lights kept having to be reset during the course of my stay. The general cleanliness of the rooms was not great.
Best Western Springfield,5,Great location and service,We had a wonderful time! The breakfast buffet was delicious and lots of variety! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Only downside was the elevator was broke for 2 days of our stay but glad we were only on the 4th floor. The free shuttle to the metro was awesome and saved us so much in parking and the hassle of DC traffic. The room was clean and housekeeping provided our needs in necessities.
Best Western Springfield,1,Not for Business Traveler,No desk or desk chair. No Internet except for rooms close to office. Air conditioner very loud. Uncomfortable bed.
Best Western Springfield,3,OK Hotel,My stay was OK but could have been much better if the hotel was pet friendly. The maid didn't speak English so couldn't understand any requests for normal room amenities.
Best Western Springfield,2,Disappointing.,Staff not all that friendly or helpful at check-in. Hot water was scalding and regulator did not work properly. Breakfast was not great. Toilet had slow leak.
Best Western Springfield,4,ok hotel,"The Continental breakfast was wonderful, like a buffet. Even though it was a bit of a distance from Washington D. C. there was a shuttle to the metro station that goes into the city. I was not happy with the help from the desk personel and the room did have an odor. the hotel was clean."
Best Western Springfield,4,DC Trip.,Have stayed here twice before. Friendly and helpful staff. Providing convenient shuttle to Metro. Good stay.
Best Western Springfield,3,"Decent hotel, decent price.","Wasn't too thrilled that I had to hike up three flights of stairs to get to my room since none of the elevator were working, but then I found out from some other guests that were sitting out in the first floor hallway that the downstairs had horrible internet service, so being on an upper floor turned out to have its advantages. No complaints regarding the room, amenities, or free breakfast."
Best Western Springfield,3,"surprisingly good breakfast, the rest ok or meh","included full breakfast had eggs (dried scrambled kind), sausage, potatoes, a Waffle Maker (yay) - on top of juices, yogurt, etc ... our Wireless Internet did not work in our room. The building layout was a little spooky, but the price was VERY reasonable, AND had free parking. This was a great value for 20 less than other Springfield hotels, and much less than staying in DC itself (with just 20min drive-time). I would stay here again."
Best Western Springfield,5,Loved it!,"The employees there are so helpful! Breakfast was great, little different everyday. And with the shuttle to the metro, transportation was a breeze! Never had to wait for anything! We will go back and tell others about this wonderful hotel"
Best Western Springfield,1,Expected so much more,"I requested a non smoking room. When I opened my door I could smell heavy scent is stale cigarettes and alcohol. Every thing in the room seemed dingy. So much so I had to go to the local grocery store and buy sanitation wipes.and come back clean my room. The AC did not work well at all. The next morning I go down to the breakfast and there is the front desk in the dining area yelling at a couple because they were eating there. And then he goes and gets another female employee and she goes over and starts yelling at them. Granted the couple were not guests of the hotel. But everyone knows you should put on a professional face at all times. The could have asked them quietly to follow them out. Then after work I returned to my room to find that the maids and come in but didn't even replace the towels. This is the worst experience at a hotel I have ever had. I will not be returning, and I do travel to DC about every other month for business. And this hotel will permanently be marked off my list. Needs a total face lift and brand new well trained staff. I would wipe it clean and start with a brand new clean slate... With everything."
Best Western Springfield,5,Nice hotel,"The hotel staff, Ms. Vundee (I think this is how you spell her name) was an excellent hostess/ waitress in the breakfast room, she made the experience worthwhile. She was the only one who was very welcoming, cheerful, informative, caring in general a very good leader (she deserves a raise). The others in the front desk were average. The full breakfast was good with many options!"
Best Western Springfield,5,En transit,"Hotel bien situe dans, pres de la ville de Washington et a proximite de la route pour se rendre dans les etats du Sud."
Best Western Springfield,4,value hotel,nice breakfast included some rooms are nice while others are bad/old or need repairs location near interstate highway.
Best Western Springfield,4,Good experience - will stay again,Good place to stay. Breakfast could have been a little better as it was the same everyday. They serve scrambled eggs in breakfast which wasnt cooked well and was prepared in hurry. The staff were very professional and helpful.
Best Western Springfield,5,Very Nice Little Hotel,This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel. It is clean and very pleasant. We definitely will return.
Best Western Springfield,4,Nice for the price,"I enjoyed my 3-night stay here. I was given a nice room the continental breakfast was first rate. There was some trouble with one of the elevators, and the room was overly perfumed, but the staff were friendly and helpful."
Best Western Springfield,4,Hotel is OK for the price,The breakfast was good even thought it's the same thing every day... I will recommend for a short stay.
Best Western Springfield,5,What a great bargain!,"FIrst, the young woman who works at the front desk should get a raise. She was one of the most pleasant and helpful hotel employees I have met. She was able to answer every question and didn't seem to mind that we asked the same ones several times. Second, breakfast was wonderful. Finally, location was perfect for the conference we needed to attend the following day. The only reason I rated surrounding neighborhood so low is that the hotel is surrounded by highways, but that adds to its convenience."
Best Western Springfield,3,Room had dank smell and feel.,"The hotel was generally clean, well maintained, comfortable beds, towels at poolside, breakfast buffet reasonably stocked. However, there were a couple of problems with our room. We stayed in room 120 for two nights. First, when we entered the room we were all struck by a kind of damp feeling and ammonia smell. I thought it was just cleaning fluid and our noses did adjust in a few minutes. However, upon reentering the room each time the smell was always there and did not go away. Additionally, paper left in the room got that kind of damp feel about it where it goes a little limp, and wet clothes hung up upon our arrival were still damp two days later, even though the air conditioner was on the whole time. Theres almost certainly water collecting somewhere in the room causing the ammonia smell and damp feeling. Its worth noting that the air conditioner was new and quiet and worked fine, and I wouldnt have suspected any problem. However, my suspicion is that it was set to recirculate or perhaps the drain was clogged, or both. I looked for a recirculate control on the A/C, but couldnt find one. Either that or theres a plumbing leak somewhere in the room, though I saw no sign of it. I reported this to the clerk on checkout. The other problem is that the tub drain was misaligned with tub floor and would not close properly, so it was impossible to take a tub bath. The clerk offered to switch our room, but it was not worth the trouble since we were checking out soon."
Best Western Springfield,3,Worth a stay.,Three fire alarms over 2 nights was unusual for this hotel. Try the mocha machine in the breakfast area.
Best Western Springfield,2,They've let this place go,"It's like this used to be a decent hotel and they just stopped caring. Took the hotel clerk 3 tries to give me the right keys, after sending me to the wrong room. Beds are not very comfortable, and the heating / cooling is really noisy."
Best Western Springfield,3,Udemrket hotel for kortere ophold.,"Udemrket hotel for kortere ophold. Det var ikke fantastisk, men hvad kan forventes til denne pris Flink reception og okay vrelse."
Best Western Springfield,4,DC trip experience - I would do it again,"This hotel is a great stay if you're looking to go into DC. Me and my friend went down at the end of Aug 2010. Although we had to change rooms two times, overall, the experience was good. The first room had the smell of urine so we asked to change. The second room had a roach in it so again we asked to change. We weren't taking any chances because if there is one roach there may be more. Finally, the third room was great. The hotel was conveniently located near the train station, mall, and diner. The hotel shuttle was great also. There were many options during breakfast. We received small gifts from the hotel during our stay such as goody bags and treats. It was really nice to come back after being away from the hotel and find something special left in the room. That was nice. The outside of the hotel was really beautiful. I really enjoyed my experience and think that I would stay there again."
Best Western Springfield,5,Very convenient to highways,Room was very clean. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast was a plus and good. Close to highways (only 20 minutes from DC attractions. Nearby to shopping and local restaurants. The Silver Diner nearby was excellent.
Best Western Springfield,4,Good Service,"Was visiting DC and the hotel was conveniently close to metro, with a shuttle service to get you there. Continental breakfast was great. All the staff were very friendly and helpful."
Best Western Springfield,4,"More respect to customers' finance, please","We liked the hotel very much. The room was quite cosy. There was a shuttle service to the nearest subway station. The only thing I did not like is that our check-in receptionist wanted us to pay only by card. But the payment conditions of our cards do not allow taking money without entering a PIN code and by ourselves. The receptionist insisted by demanding if otherwise a 200 deposit (we had not known about this condition before) and we agreed about the card. The payment result in one day was declined payment and a blocked by our bank card (as the bank considered the payment suspicios or the card as stolen by an American). So, finally we paid cash. Please, respect customers and their banks' attempt to protect them. But altogether I did like our stay there and enjoyed it."
Best Western Springfield,4,About what I expected in this price range.,"The hearty breakfast was very good, Eggs, Waffles, cereals, jucies, danish, fruit, etc. any thing you want. The room was average but clean."
Best Western Springfield,4,Great hotel for the low price,"My husband, baby daughter and I really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. You are in a great location near all the restaurants and shops and you cannot beat the price! The beds were not the best quality but were comfortable. I liked the fact there was a microwave and mini fridge in the room. It is not the fanciest hotel to stay in but it met our immediate needs and was very accomodating for a weekend trip getaway with my family. The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and courteous too. When we return to the area we will come back to this hotel."
Best Western Springfield,4,Great value for the money,Great rooms for the price and great breakfast compared to the usual continental. Shuttle service to the Metro line very useful. Great way to travel to the downtown area and even to the airport.
Best Western Springfield,3,"nice rooms/pool, GREAT breakfast, Horrible staff","Checked in at 3am had an early flight, the hotel employee that checked me in was rude and very unpleasant! He lied to me about a hold on my account, before he made me go to my bank and transfor money becusee my card wouldn't work then when I came back he told me that they would place a 200 hold when he prev told me that there would be no hold!! Just rude his whole attitude! Asked for a manager but was told no one is on duty."
Best Western Springfield,2,nefasto,"Los colchones no son comodos, solo trabajo un elevador, las toallas curtidas, el aire acondicionado no se pudo regular la temperatura."
Best Western Springfield,3,"Great Breakfast Location, OK rooms","The breakfast bar was wonderful, so many choices. The location was pretty good and they provide shuttle to Metro. The room was not great. The bathroom was clean, the beds were on the small side. The rest of the room seemed a bit outdated (but fine by me for the price). BIG DOWNFALL. Gum on two areas of the headboard. I do not know who puts gum on the top and side of the headboard, but I am more disturbed housekeeping did not see it to clean it up. Overall for the price compared to others it was pretty good."
Best Western Springfield,3,Do not disturb means do not disturb!,"We checked in very late to the hotel and asked if we could check out at 1 pm instead of noon and they said it was fine. I put the do not disturb sign on the door just to have the cleaning staff disregard it. They knocked twice at about 9:30 waking up my husband, and then proceeded to try opening the door. Since I had the lock on, they realized we were not ready for them to clean. They came back a second time an hour later and did the same thing. This time since my husband had woken up, I yelled out we're not ready! Do not disturb means do not disturb. I called the front desk and they said that they would talk to the cleaning manager. As we were getting ready, they knocked again and again. To say the least we ended up not sleeping well at all. This is unacceptable! What's the point of offering a sign that's going to be disregarded. I hope no one else has a similar experience."
Best Western Springfield,4,This really fit the bill!,"I needed a place that was a quick on-and-off the highway to get to my conference. This one was convenient to 495 and 395. I appreciated the free breakfast, and there was a really big selection of good hot and cold food! I needed a break on the room rate because I only work part-time."
Best Western Springfield,3,Just a little help.,"A nice place to stay. I would recommend changing the breakfast menu (it was dried out, pretty tasteless, except for the waffles). One of the 2 elevators was broken, so you had to walk all the way to the other end of the hotel, go to your floor, then walk all tbe way back to your room. The staff, however, are top notch. Going to DC they have a shuttle to the metro. Good value for the price."
Best Western Springfield,3,Not the usual Best Western Standards,Basic and a little under the standard i expect from a Best Western. Having the basin in the room as opposed to within the bathroom was not a feature that we enjoyed and the bathroom could have been cleaner
Best Western Springfield,2,Worst looking hotel in location,Air conditioning unit whined like an airliner approaching a landing-annoying plus wasn't very efficient! Mattress's have seen better day's ( or in this case - better night's ) need replacing. Our room was on the Interstate side (back of hotel) VERY NOISEY- actually thought at one point that the window was open. Ironing board leg's were severely bent - broke in half when attempting to close after use - which was difficult to use since it wouldn't lock upright!
Best Western Springfield,4,Close to the Metro. Nice amenities.,Appreciated the shuttle service! Very friendly staff.
Best Western Springfield,4,DC,"The hotel was undergoing renovations and we did have a problem with the water leaking from the second floor on us as we were on the first floor. The kids loved the pool and the breakfast was very nice. They let you in the breakfast area all day which is very nice for late night snacks for the kids and drinks for the adults. The shuttle to the metro station to catch the subway into DC was very nice and they pick you up as well. I know some folks complain that the last pick up is at 9 pm, but since the DC mall exhibits close at 6 pm it was not a problem. Due to the price of the metro I would recommend the travel time to start on or after 9:30 am"
Best Western Springfield,4,Affordable and comfortable,Thanks for daily breakfast. Great hospitality staff. Clean. Quiet. Easy access to restaurants and freeway.
Best Western Springfield,5,My choice from now on when I visit DC,"I booked 2 rooms online and made special requests directly to the hotel, all of which were met without any problems. I had some additional requests on our arrival again all were met with great attitudes by the hotel employees. The staff was always pleasant and helpful. Though it is close to the highway, our rooms were in the front and below highway level, so noise was not at all a problem. The free breakfast is great, offering freshly baked waffles, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruit, as well as the usual. Shuttle was always available during our stay and took us to restaurants as well as the Metro. We will definitely return when we visit the DC area again."
Best Western Springfield,3,"Great staff and breakfast, but that's about it","The hotel staff are super friendly and helpful. The hot breakfast is also very good. Apart from the usual cold fare, the hot part included scrambled egg, home fries, and one other item (bacon or sausage or biscuit/gravy) during our stay. But that's where the positives end. The hotel condition is pretty bad. Rooms, elevators and all other common areas need major renovation. Many small issues existed in our room to name a few - the faucet head was broken, the hooks in the bathroom were missing, the phone was not working, the in-room lighting was poor (probably the darkest hotel room in my experience and I travel a lot). Oh, I forgot to mention one other positive - the free shuttle van to nearby places including the metro station. All in all, it's a ok hotel if you are a student or in a tight budget. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
Best Western Springfield,2,"Hotel trying their best, but facility is just old",The staff was very nice but the rooms are just old. Had a strange smell to the room and my daughter actually got congested while we were staying there. It may not have had anything to do with the room but you can't help but wonder. The breakfast was nice. Hotel just needs a major renovation. We felt safe in the area.
Best Western Springfield,4,Great deal for the price,This hotel is a bit of a ride on the metro if you are going to DC but the facilities and staff are excellent. Great place for families with kids and an amazing breakfast. The shuttle to or from the metro is free and we only had to wait once for pick up - normally very prompt except for one 30 minute wait. Would highly recommend this hotel.
Best Western Springfield,5,Close to Metro for trip into Washington DC,"Very comfortable beds, nice linens. We used the mini refrig for cold waters and drinks. Great Breakfasts!! Friendly, helpful staff."
Best Western Springfield,4,Perfect,"Drove up from NC for a quick getaway with the fam. Booked room thru expedia, price and location was great. Staff was outstanding! Very helpful! Hot breakfast was cherry on top! We'll be back here."
Best Western Springfield,3,Bani1977,"Good for one nigth , excellent brakfast"
Best Western Springfield,5,"Nice hotel, friendly staff, very clean",Hotel was very clean. Staff was friendly and knowledgable. A lot of nearby shopping centers.
Best Western Springfield,3,Basic as it gets,"When we checked in and proceded up to our room, we went into the room to find they had a maintainence worker still working on something in the bathroom! They had no other rooms available, so they just hurried him up with whatever he was fixing. Tour groups of young adults, who seemed to have no supervision, were allowed to run up and down the hallways and stairs at all hours of the night! They even had ball games they were playing in the halls, and were calling other guests rooms with prank phone calls. When we called down to complain (about 11:00PM), we were told we needed to be patient! This went on every night of the trip, and we were there 8 days!"
Best Western Springfield,5,Exceeded Expectations,"The rooms, service, location, staff, and breakfasts were perfect. And the pool was unbelievably enticing despite its (or maybe because of its) unusual location!"
Best Western Springfield,4,my stay,"came in, used toilet, wouldn't flush b/c chain detached, fixed myself next to exit door, all night heard people going in/out-I had to be up very early next morning and this was rather disruptive. I even had fan in bathroom and AC on"
Best Western Springfield,5,small but fine,"Rooms are small, but staff is very accommodating. A good jumping-off place for commuting into DC"
Best Western Springfield,5,Very nice and confirtable hotel near DC,"Very clean, near DC. Breakfast very good. Easy to locate, staff was friendly. Only I did not have time to try the pool."
Best Western Springfield,4,what a great hotel and staff,a very nice experience for people taking the auto train for the first time as we did....cant' go wrong with this hotel.....everyone was very nice ....would go back if the situation was the same
Best Western Springfield,1,unsafe,Location is unsafe and hotel looks pretty old. I used to stay at Best Western but I do not recommend anyone to stay here.
Best Western Springfield,5,A graet stay in DC,"Great place to stay if you want to go to DC The room was very good, we had a welcome gift waiting in our room which was very nice. The staff was very helpfull and gave us at check-in unasked very usefull info about the surrounding area and ways to travel within DC. Our room was on the opposite side of the highway and onthe 2nd floor with no highway noise. The hot breakfast (eggs, waffles, grits, oatmeal, etc.) is very good and the same everyday but there is enough of a variety. The shuttle will take you anywhere within 3 miles and to the DC Metro station, all you have to do is call and they will pick you up as well. The pool is very clean and all day there's a lifeguard, the pool was a great way to cool off after walking all day around DC!"
Best Western Springfield,3,It was ok,The service is bad there is no privacy
Best Western Springfield,3,OK HOTEL,"The hotel is very basic but the room we stayed in was clean and comfortable. After staying at other Best Western hotels, this hotel could include many more amenties. The hotel had an odor that was not pleasing, 1 of 2 elavators was out of service. Breakfast items were plentiful but the staff could not keep up during peak times and the buffet area got very messy. The front desk service employees were helpful and polite. I would not go back to this hotel inspite of the good price."
Best Western Springfield,4,Anew awakening!,Good!
Best Western Springfield,3,Nice Management,"This hotel is undergoing extensive renovation. It is currently filled with the sounds of hammering and the unrenovated sections are seriously outdated. We had a leaky air conditioner in the room which swamped the carpeting. I used four towels to mop up one section. The management was attentive to repairing the AC, but we had a fan running for two days to try to dry out the carpet. I'm sure this will be a great place once the renovations are complete."
Best Western Springfield,4,Muy buena opcion.,Excelente
Best Western Springfield,3,A reasonable value for money in a budget motel,"Okay value for money. No bugs, odors, or loud noises. The breakfast was considerably above average. The condition of the room needed upgrading: wall paper, bathroom door. Some lights (2) not working properly. We slept well."
Best Western Springfield,4,Almost perfect,I would have given this hotel 5 stars except my TV and internet went out during a heavy rain storm. The staff was pleasant and when my double room wasn't ready they upgraded my to a king.
Best Western Springfield,5,Quite happy with hotel,"Hotel was clean and neat. Rooms are wll kept, they have all the necessities that you would need. mornings get crowded at the continental breakfast. Staff very pleasant. overall a good experience."
Best Western Springfield,4,nice hotel,nice hotel 15 minutes from DC. clean with nice pool in nice neighbourhood. small bed. bad breakfast
Best Western Springfield,4,Great value for the price,"Entire Staff were excellent, with special mention for Taunya and Kayla at the front desk. They were always cheerful,smiling, and very helpful. Great breakfast, only issue is that space is limited so you may have to wait to sit if you want to eat there. Our room was worn and dated....Hotel needs updating but from the looks of it they may be in the process of doing. Large outdoor pool was clean and well kept. Kids loved it :-) Many restaurants and a very nice shopping mall minutes away. Overall.... great value for the price."
Best Western Springfield,3,"Worn, but clean, with exceptional staff!","The hotel has some wear but the rooms are very clean and the staff is excellent. I would not hesitate to stay there again, though the hotel does need some updating to stay competitive."
Best Western Springfield,5,We'll be back!,"We stayed for 5 nights, and we were extremely pleased. It's not a new building, but it is well maintained. What we were most pleased about was the breakfast buffet! It was a true buffet (not just pre-wrapped pastries)--Eggs, potatoes, sausage, bacon, waffles, cereal, fruit, bagels, toast, etc. This saved us a lot of money, because we could start the day with a hearty meal. Additionally, Stacy at the front desk was very helpful with all kinds of information. I highly recommend this hotel! We hope to stay there again in August."
Best Western Springfield,4,Nice hotel,"This was a nice hotel. The building is old and has been there for a while, but the room was clean and the furnishings were nice. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would stay here again."
Best Western Springfield,3,vacation,"I thought the staff was friendly. The breakfast was ok, with the steamer for the eggs, they were green in areas. The shuttle was great to and from....I wish the weather was better."
Best Western Springfield,4,Army ten miler weekend,"I was really pleased with the choice I made to stay at this Best Western. I needed a place close to the Pentagon and this hotel was not more than 10 minutes from the Springfield-Arcadia metro stop and right off of route 95 so it was the perfect location! There were plenty of restaurants nearby and the staff at the front desk were extremely nice. The only problem was that our room was right next to the elevator and we were awakened more than once during the nice by some loud guests. Other than that, I was satisfied with everything else including the price."
Best Western Springfield,4,"Convenient to Springfield Mall and Washington, DC","Mediocre. 2-12 hole in the carpet. Reading lamp missing from desk. Only one bulb in the lamp on the bedside stand, so the room was dark! Overall attention to details is lacking. The front desk staff are polite and helpful. The HVAC unit works well and is relatively quiet."
Best Western Springfield,5,its good,"nice hotel, good security, little parkig, full thu-sun"
Best Western Springfield,3,was ok ---,was ok ---
Best Western Springfield,3,Great location and low price,"Great location with easy on and off of the freeway in any direction. Hot breakfast was very good. Rooms a little run down but satisfactory. Price was very reasonable for the location and the pool was well maintained. Staff polite and helpful. I travel to this area a couple of times a year and this was my first time staying in this hotel, I will utilize this hotel next time."
Best Western Springfield,5,"Nice place, great location and price","We stayed for 3 days over the Memorial Day weekend 2015. This was a good hotel. Great location and very convenient to the Metro train. They have a REAL, full breakfast selection which was great..! We would definitely stay there again in a heartbeat."
Best Western Springfield,5,Two thum up,"It's like any other hotel at this class but the staffs were friendly , room was clean full break-fast plenty of food and drink , the shuttle service to and from subway(metro) is free anytime you like , it's worth the cost of hotel fare. I would recommend for quests who like to spend not much but want more amenities or service this is the right hotel to choose ."
Best Western Springfield,4,"Cheap, great breakfast, easy access to metro","After doing research for hotels in D.C areas, I found this hotel very attractive in term of price and easy access to metro to D.C. They provide shuttle to the closest metro station, and the metro go directly to D.C downtown which is very helpful for us. However, I recommend to use their shuttle not during the peak hours, especially from 5 to 7pm, otherwise you end up joining a bunch of people waiting for shuttle. The breakfast is surprisingly very good, especially the waffle which is one of the best. My kids and I love it, and I recommend this hotel for family trip."
Best Western Springfield,5,DC Visit,"I had to request a room change because the initial room was not able to get wi-fi access (Room 405). We were allowed to move to Room 128 where it worked. The hotel was clean and up-to-date. Very pleasant. The breakfast bar was the best one we encountered on the entire trip. In fact, I can say of the five motels/hotels we stayed in on our trip -- in Pennsylvania and Virginia -- this one was the best."
Best Western Springfield,5,Free breakfast and good location,Complimentary breakfast is offered which is great when you're on a family trip. Located near the metro station and with many restaurants and stores in the surrounding area.
Best Western Springfield,5,On my list for return visits,"great location, great price, nice pool, ongoing upkeep apparent, best breakfast with many food choices, free parking"
Best Western Springfield,4,Good budget option,"The rooms were clean, well air-conditioned and large, with good bathrooms, basic cable TV and wireless Internet access. There's also a computer in the reception area. The desk service was very helpful and polite. There's a medium-sized outdoor pool. The complimentary breakfast includes many items, and you can make your own waffles. There is a shuttle bus until 10 pm to the metro stop, which is the last stop on the line. It takes 30-45 minutes to get to the center of Washington. The shuttle can fill up, and can take a while to pick you up. We did find parking at the metro stop lot, but that can fill up."
Best Western Springfield,1,AWFUL,"It was overbearingly awful. The humidity and the foul mold odor was over our heads. Thank God we only stayed one night, but seriously this hotel either needs a demolition or remodeling."
Best Western Springfield,4,Great stay just outside of DC,Enjoyed a three night stay at this Best Western while in the DC area. Booked two nights originally through Hotels.com and decided to stay one additional night and the staff honored the same price as the original price through Hotels.com. Absolutely the best continental breakfast bar none. Staff was very helpful with touring information and room was very neat and clean. Would definitely stay here again when back in DC area.
Best Western Springfield,4,Grosszugiges Zimmer,"Angenehmer Hotelaufenthalt mit ausreichendem Fruhstucksangebot. Hotel wurde uberwiegend nur zur Ubernachtung genutzt. Positiv das Zimmer war sauber und komfortabel eingerichtet. Negativ, man konnte das Fenster nicht offnen wodurch das Luften des Zimmers nur durch die Klimaluftung erfolgte. Ansonsten freundliches Service-Personal. Der Shuttleservice funktionierte ohne Probleme."
Best Western Springfield,4,Good Location and Great Breakfast,"I stayed at this hotel for four nights and enjoyed my stay. The location was convienantly located next to I-95 (although somewhat hard to find the first time due to the congestion of the area) and a 5-10 minute drive to the Franconia-Springfield metro station. The free breakfast included all you can eat scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, and waffles along with the usual fare, a nice touch. The breakfast room was kept clean and well stocked by an ever present staff member. The staff was about the friendliest and most helpful of any hotel I've stayed in. My only complaints would be a weak air conditioner and noisiness in the early evening due to the large number of children staying there. Quiet overnight, though."
Best Western Springfield,4,Nice Family Hotel,"The room was great!! We stayed in an Executive level room. The front desk staff wasn't very friendly. They had a lifeguard on duty at the pool all the time which was nice. The breakfast was very good with a nice variety of foods. It's very convenient to the metro. Free parking at the hotel was a plus. It is the last stop on the metro which at first we thought was a bad thing but ended up being good since we always had a seat in the morning on the way to D.C. Overall, I would recommend this hotel especially for the price. It's also very convenient to the Springfield Mall which is currently closed due to renovation but should open next year."
Best Western Springfield,5,convienent,"Very nice staff and shuttle bus for anything within 3 miles. Excellent breakfast. 2 blocks to get to any expressway, The Silver Diner was great. Great value for the bucks."
Best Western Springfield,4,Location,"I have stayed in this area a few times and think it is among the best if you are approaching D.C. from the south by car. There is a nice shuttle to the nearby Metro and mall area so you can stay parked for your stay. If you have to drive, it is closer to D.C. and Arlington then it looks on the map. The rooms are a bit small but reasonably comfortable. Breakfast is a notch above the usual fare. Best of all, price is affordable for families or for the business traveler."
Best Western Springfield,2,Not Satisfied,"Before I booked this hotel I reviewed comments and rating which indicated I would be satisfied. Unfortunately, I was highly DISAPPOINTED! The hotel elevator had a bad smell, my air conditioner worked best at night, I could hear my neighbors conversation and to make my stay really memorable someone was banging on a hotel door. As for security the hotel has a door that is NOT locked and is located next to the elevator. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!"
Best Western Springfield,5,"Great buy, very helpful and friendly staff","Fantastic buy for the money. My wife and I were very pleasantly surprised. Breakfast was OK with waffles, sausage, scrambled eggs, etc. The place has been remodeled and updated, but we found the imperfections to be few and small. The travel service to the Metro station was quick, which was very important since we stayed there for 4 days."
Best Western Springfield,4,Great Stay!,"The hotel staff is always friendly and courteous. The elevator on the far side of the building seemed to be slow and not working at times, but there are two sets of stairs and one always working elevator so I really can't complain too much."
Best Western Springfield,5,"Best Western Springfield, VA","Everything about this hotel is geared to the DC business traveler. Nothing is missing from the standpoint of communications inclusive of wireless net access. They provide more than just coffee and danish in the morning there is real food. Plus snack items designed to help you make it through a difficult day on the Hill. Convenience to the Metro is a big plus, and it's provided by a shuttle. Wait staff goes out of its way to accommodate and address problems if any. We have, of course, other options as far as where to stay in the DC area, but this Best Western has my vote hands down right price, right place, right service. It's a winning hand all the way."
Best Western Springfield,4,Over nite stay,Book this room on the spur of the moment trip...service was excellent and would definately go back!
Best Western Springfield,4,My stay,relaxing. The diner could be a little cleaner but otherwise good.
Best Western Springfield,4,Good value,Although the hotel was a bit run down we enjoyed our week long stay. The staff were really helpful and friendly and it had a swimming pool which was a bonus! The shuttle service is good. If your not looking for a fancy hotel then I would recommend staying here. Lots of good resturants near by abs easy to get the metro to Washington.
Best Western Springfield,3,Excellence location,The hotel is just right of I95. Very easy to get to DC from here. The Franconia metro station is also near by. The breakfast options are the hotel are also pretty good.
Best Western Springfield,4,Good hotel for a good price,Clean rooms and generally quiet made for good sleeping. The breakfast in the morning with eggs and waffles just can't be built. I have stayed here for 3 nights each week for the last 3 weeks and will continue to do that for the next 3 weeks. The prices are reasonable and I have recommended this hotel to my co-workers (who have also stayed here at times now).
Best Western Springfield,5,Very Nice Stay,For the rate it was an amazing stay! Would definitely recommend to my friends!
Best Western Springfield,3,Adequate stay,"The stay was pretty good for what it was. Conditions of hotel are a little dated. The room was pretty good and clean. Although the bathroom a little small, and the bed not so comfy(need new mattresses). Other than that the stay was good."
Best Western Springfield,4,Quick stay,"We checked in very late around midnight and Tanya was a gem. She was very pleasant and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable although a couple of the towels in the bathroom were dirty, there were enough for all of us to use this stay. I 95 is right out your window so if you are a light sleeper request a room on the front side of the hotel."
Best Western Springfield,5,Great value,"The breakfast each morning was really quite good. A lot of food and a lot of choices - not just carbs. Also, the shuttle that takes your from the hotel to anywhere within 3 miles was extremely valuable. We got to see DC and paid much less than average per night because the shuttle allowed us to go to the Metro every day, We also used the shuttle to go to restaurants for dinner, pick up a rental car for one day, and even church on Sunday"
Best Western Springfield,2,not good for a family needs,"Not good, suppose to be there a freg. and microwave but I suffered and I have two kids."
Best Western Springfield,3,Good hotel if you can get it cheap,Decent hotel if you could get it for the right price. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it for families. Great for young people on a budget
Best Western Springfield,3,"Hotelli, joka vastasi odotuksiamme",Hotelli vastasi hyvin tarpeitamme. Huone oli siisti. Ilmainen kyyti metroasemalle ja kauppakeskukseen oli iso plussa. Aamupala oli keskitasoa.
Best Western Springfield,3,Only OK for short stay.,A very old hotel with old smelling bath tower and bedding fixtures refrigerator is only available upon request but came with broken temperature setting control knob and old floor carpet was not very cleanly vacuumed. The A/C works but noisy it would better be turned off if you preferred to have a quite sleep. The Complimentary breakfast is very good.
Best Western Springfield,4,Good place to stay for Washington DC and Northern Virginia,This was a very good hotel for our family. The management kept us together on the same floor and was very resposive to any needs we had. The continental breakfast was very acceptable. The business center was very easy to access while we were there. It is well located as to access to the interstates and has many good resturants close by. The Metro is close and very easy to access. I would have no qualms using this again the next time we are in the area.
Best Western Springfield,2,Poor Transportation,"There was a lot of miscommunication between me and the hotel pickup service. I used the metro the entire time I visited D.C. When I would get back I would have to be picked up at the Franconia-Springfield station or else it would take the driver over an hour to come pick me up, even if it was near the hotel. Additionally, there was not shuttle to Reagan National Airport. I had a flight to catch at 6:00 AM so the metro was out of the question, since it doesn't run until 5:00 AM. The hotel couldn't do because it was too far away. They were promoting a taxi service that was going to charge 40 to get to DCA. I was not impressed with this taxi service when I needed a ride from near the Hilton Hotel to Best Western (this cabbie thought New Mexico wasn't part of the U.S.). So I did use Uber to get to DCA."
Best Western Springfield,1,i was cheated out of my room,I was kicked out just 2 hours into my stay even though I paid full price thanks to the front desk people who gave out my information to an unknown third party. my safety and security was violated. I also saw cockroaches and bugs crawling all over the place. it was nasty.
Best Western Springfield,3,Good value for money,"The towels were soft, pillows somewhat firm but there was a musty smell in the room. The breakfast was ok, eggs and bacon sub par. Its good vale for money and conveniently located."
Best Western Springfield,5,Nice hotel place,They should change a carpet in the room plus painting
Best Western Springfield,4,Painting kids new home,Hotel quite comfortable with excellent breakfast and helpful staff.
Best Western Springfield,3,Security deposit,It has been a long time since I have had to give a security deposit. It hasn't been refunded yet either.
Best Western Springfield,1,Bad service,after reservation the clerk refused to check my workers because they did not had a credit card at the time and refused to get my info the person that book the hotel for the requirement credit hold.
Best Western Springfield,4,Pretty good overall.,"Overall, our stay was enjoyable. Right away, we did notice the remote didn't work, so I asked the front desk for some new batteries. They provided them, but the remote still wouldn't turn the TV on. Finally, after tapping the remote on the table, it started working. The room condition was good, and the beds were comfortable. Something that seemed unsanitary, however, was at breakfast, we found a hair on a spoon for the eggs. We showed one of the people behind the counter, but all she did was take the hair off the spoon. That was an uncomfortable situation."
Best Western Springfield,4,Enjoyed my stay,"It was a nice clean hotel, they give a free shuttle to the metro station. But on weekends the parking in the metro station is free so you can very well drive ur own car and park there. Breakfast was good too."
Best Western Springfield,4,Decent hotel at a decent price.,"For being located in the city of D. C. the price was reasonable. My biggest complaint was that I booked ahead of time through Expedia and paid using my credit card. When I arrived I noticed that they gave AAA members a discount and asked if I can get the discount being that I am a member. Of course, they said sorry but you already paid for the room and there is nothing we can do about it. Gotta love it when computers tie the hands of people from being able to do what's right. I should have been able to receive this discount but, the computers would not allow it. This is wrong. In the past before modern technology they would have done this. While all this was happening there was a gentlemen next to me that complained about a price variance due to not receiving a AAA discount and the staff did an over-ride for him because he did not pay yet. I'm not sure I can use services such as Expedia again if this is the result. I hate feeling ripped off and I definitely was in this case so no more Expedia for me unless I get my discount back."
Best Western Springfield,3,Good value convenient to the Metro,"For the price, the hotel was satisfactory. However, we had an extremely long wait at night for the shuttle van a the nearby Metro rail station despite giving more than 15 minutes (the requested amount of time) notice and making repeated followup calls. Also, the lone elevator was out of order throughout our 3-evening stay - making checking in and checking out more difficult."
Best Western Springfield,5,Great hotel for travellers on a budget,"The staff was remarkable. I was only there 2 nights, and in that short time 3 different people went out of their way to make sure I had what I needed. Absolutely superb staff! I'm a frequent traveler, and your people made this a very enjoyable experience."
Best Western Springfield,5,Friendly staff,"The hotel staff was friendly and helpful at any hour of the day or night. Food was hot and freshly prepared. The only down-side was the fire alarms went off 3 of the 4 nights we were there - twice with cause and once accidentally. The shuttle service is a great plus and staff willingly took us to/from the Metro station every day. Even though the location seems a little far from downtown DC, it's extremely convenient to the Metro and other amenities in the neighborhood. For a mid-range hotel, it's quite comfortable. Extra kudos to Stacey :-)"
Best Western Springfield,4,Continental Breakfast,"Excellent breakfast, lot of variety. As a business traveler it's a big help. Appreciated the complimentary USA Today. Overall very good experience, would go back there again."
Best Western Springfield,5,Wonderful place to stay,"We were extremely pleased and surprised with our stay at this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and went out of the way to make our stay comfortable. There was a lifeguard at the pool and 2 computers in the lobby with internet access that we could use anytime we wanted, which we never expected. There was a full breakfast every morning which was superb! There was a shuttle to the Metro that ran from 7am-10pm and anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel, but you had to be prepared to wait. The hotel is walking distance to Springfield Mall and restaurants. Don't rent a car to go to WA DC as the Metro will get you within walking distance of the major attractions, saving you time and money. If we go back to DC we will stay there again."
Best Western Springfield,4,Good Value,Breakfast was excellent every morning in restaurant setting...shuttle was quick and efficient.
Best Western Springfield,5,Family Reunion,The staff was very helpful in all aspects of service and provided our family with very helpful service to all the local venue
Best Western Springfield,3,Best Western - Springfield Mall,"A good value hotel with all the amenities you need located on the main routes into and around Washington DC. Now looking a bit tired the rooms are functional and clean. The hotel operates a complimentary minibus shuttle to any location within 3 miles of the hotel, this includes the nearest DC metro station and a large shopping mall. The hotel is located literally on a highway junction which makes getting to and leaving on the right highway an entertaining challenge. The complimentary breakfast is a good start to the day. In summary, a good value option that ticks all the right boxes for a visitor on a budget."
Best Western Springfield,3,Just ok,Not bad for the price. Some highway noise. Guest can not come to your room without you coming to down to get them.
Best Western Springfield,4,Convenient,"This is the 2nd time staying at the hotel. Very convenient to a club we go to for concerts. There are a number of good eating places nearby. A little confusing to get to if you are not familiar with the area. For some reason, there was only one bath towel in the room when we checked in, but they were able to get us a 2nd set shortly after we notified them. Also, the shower may have been hooked up incorrectly because H meant cold and C meant hot in our case. The breakfast is very good. Overall, we would stay there again good rates, friendly front desk, and the breakfast are all reasons to come back."
Best Western Springfield,3,Value for money on your family vacation to DC.,Older motel.Iffie room but you get value for your money. Safe neighborhood.Close to metro rail transport. Great staff (Salima from Marocco) The free breakfeast was worldclass.Totally upperclass !. If you want value for money in DC this is a great choice.
Best Western Springfield,2,Holes in carpets. Run down for a new hotel.,It was a recently built hotel allowed to fall into disrepair. Staff was gone or unhelpful. Room felt like a motel 6. Maybe. Was ok for 85. But no more. View of interstate exit ramp. I would recommend most other places. It did in a pinch and was close to dc. Didn't feel unsafe. Just unkept. It was fine to sleep in. And the pool was nice.
Best Western Springfield,4,Not what I expected from reviews on Expedia,"Location was very convenient, although using their free shuttle to Metro Station probably is not that convenient. We just parked at the station for 4.50/day. If you don't have a car, then I think you could make the shuttle work for you, or take a cab. We booked 2 rooms. Cons: Both were very small, with shabby, 80's looking furnishings. Rooms had an unpleasant musty smell that a/c didn't remedy. One room we booked did not have a fridge and microwave although the hotel lists that as an amenity for their rooms. Ice machine only available on 2nd floor. There isn't one on 4th floor and the one on 3rd floor didn't work. Old-style TV's when almost every other hotel in this category has nicer flat screens. Beds, while somewhat comfortable, were made up with not so great linens (thin sheets, old bedspreads). No laundry room, which is only needed for multi-day stays. Pros: Good housekeeping service swimming pool kept very clean with a lifeguard present at all times, towels are sometimes available at the pool EXCELLENT full hot breakfast available with enough options for daily variety for a multi-day stay. All in all, would probably look a little closer at another Springfield, VA lodging option if visiting in the future. Although most of our time spent in a hotel room is simply sleeping or preparing to go out for the day, would prefer to have just a little more elbow room than this hotel offers."
Best Western Springfield,2,Good location - overpriced as it is old...,"Great service, awesome breakfast Poor, old building, elevator was not working for a 5 floor building!!!!"
Best Western Springfield,4,Very comfortable.,"Rate is adecuate, good breakfast."
Best Western Springfield,4,Outdoor pool was nice. Breakfast plenty of choice.,Outdoor pool was nice. Breakfast plenty of choice. Also shuttle bus to train station was favorable.
Best Western Springfield,3,"A value for the money, I would return","The overall building is clean but showing some signs of wear...The front desk staff are very friendly, polite and helpful. Its in a safe area and there is a nice big mall a block down the street. There is a free shuttle that brings you right to the Springfield metro subway station. The breakfast spot next door is not an award winner, but hey it's included so don't complain. The only thing we didn't like is that some families hung out in the halls late at night chit chatting loudly. I guess it was our misfortune that night and the other thing was that the cleaning staff started vacuuming the halls like at 7 am in the morning and it wakes you up...other than that its okay for a short stay."
Best Western Springfield,2,I don't recommend.,The room smelled musty and sink was located outside of the bathroom. We got better rooms for the same price. Very disappointed
Best Western Springfield,5,Extremely pleased,One of the most enjoyable stays. Everything was excellent.
Best Western Springfield,3,Hotel is close to major highways,"Our experience was ok. The room felt crammed with only 2 people. I didn't like the sink being outside of the bathroom. On the first day after checking in the TV would not turn on. Problem with the remote control. Once it came on some local channels were grainy. Not very clear. On the 3rd day housekeeping didn't take out trash, clean, or make the beds. I had to take out the trash myself. They only took towels out. I went and spoke to the front desk and a few hours later someone came and cleaned and replaced the towels. The breakfast area was small for the amount of people they have staying there."
Best Western Springfield,4,"Reasonable rates, good family hotel.","Pluses: reasonable rates, great helpful friendly staff, shuttle to trains, nearby mall, lots of dining choices minutes from hotel. Minuses : mattresses old and needing update, rooms dark more lights will help lots, a refrigerator is a must in a room. Long ride into town by train and 5-6 bucks each way. Tip: leave your car at the station for 5 bucks and fast return to hotel or mall."
Best Western Springfield,4,good hotel!,"I stayed this hotel for 4 days to travel washington dc. Its locations is pretty good to go convenient facilities. However, if your purpose of visiting dc is to travel, you need to have a car. I would stay here next visiting dc."

Hampton Inn & Suites Wilmington Christiana,5,Visiting family,Overall this is a nice hotel. However I did encounter a group of rowdy cheerleaders who were Loud. I had to complain each night about the noise but it was handled. Rooms were clean and Comfortable. I would stay here again. Sometimes you just have to complain if your stay is Unpleasant. I was compensated for my inconvenience.
Hampton Inn & Suites Wilmington Christiana,5,Visiting family,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel! From the staff to the food to the cleanliness of the rooms, this is a wonderful place to stay! It's a convenient location surrounded by several great restaurants and minutes from the mall."
TownePlace Suites by Marriott Suffolk Chesapeake,5,"Clean, Courtious and helpful","Due to an unexpected ice storm in Maine, we needed to leave a day early. Not only did this hotel take us in a day early, they let us into the room at 10 instead of 3! The food we brought along for our Coast Guard son survived! The hotel staff was amazing, helpful and courteous. The room was spotless, NO BED BUGS!!. The hotel is located close to Walmart, many nice eateries, shopping. 15 min from Newark, an hour or so from Virginia Beach and 5 min from the Coast Guard Base. Thank you so much for making our stay in Suffolk, Virginia. We will certainly be staying there in June when our son graduates A school! Thank you!"

TownePlace Suites by Marriott Suffolk Chesapeake,5,conveniently located,"The hotel is well worth the extra money! Excellent staff, the facilities are very nice, and it's well located. 35 minutes from the beach in one direction 35 minutes from Williamsburg/Busch Gardens in the other direction. The staff was spot on. When we checked in, we needed linens for the pull-out bed. By the time I was able to unload my car, they were there waiting on the bed!"
TownePlace Suites by Marriott Suffolk Chesapeake,5,Nice hotel...very nice staff,"I was there to visit my daughter and her family, that live in Porstmouth, VA. The hotel is very close to them. I was able to bring my dog. The hotel staff allowed me to leave and leave my dog loose in the room, which was AWESOME! They even assured me that if he got loud, they would just call me. The room was a studio..plenty of room for us both. The hotel was refurbished a year ago. They offer breakfast each morning, waffles, fruit, cereal, etc. They even have snacks, drinks, for sale. Plus anything you might have forgotten! Love this place! I will go back regularly!"

Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,5,Great location,The people a extremely polite and the room service was perfect. rooms and bathrooms were spotless.
Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,5,Couple night out,Very nice hotel with the exception of the bed. It was very hard and uncomfortable.
Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,5,Great hotel near a host of resturants,"Perfect hotel! Indoor pool, Hot tube, clean, comfortable, staff was friendly. It is located across from a shopping center with great restaurants and a movie theater...the beach was about 35-40 mins away which took me by surprise because under researched it...but I didn't seem to mind the drive. Overall I would recommend it to anyone."
Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,4,Uncomfortable mattress,"I check in the interior of the hotel was clean. When I got to my room, I found someone sock over in the corner and a belt under the bed. Then when I got ready to take a shower the water was cold. The mattress in the bed was not firm, it had a sunk in the middle. Overall the hotel was nice but the mattress in room 416 need to be thrown out. I was uncomfortable the entire night."
Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,5,Great Stay,The hotel was great. We drove in and our room was clean and comfortable. We enjoyed room service and the staff was great. Will stay here again when in Suffolk.
Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,3,Hotel ok but breakfast was a problem,"Hotel was generally good but the breakfast was extremely disorganized, slow, and eventually i just gave up."
Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,5,Excellent Property - Highly Recommended!!!!,"My hotel stay at the Hilton Garden Inn can only be described as over the top excellent. I was warmly welcomed by a wonderful front desk clerk named Jennifer who demonstrated exemplary customer service. The hotel was absolutely gorgeous and smelled wonderful - seriously. I stayed in a Jr. Suite and found the room to be comfortable, super clean, and well appointed. My only complaint, and it is relatively small, is that the breakfast buffet wasn't that great especially given the price. When I mentioned this upon check-out I was promptly given a Barnes Noble gift card in an effort to make up for my less than satisfactory restaurant experience. Was I impressed You bet!!!! I have never received such wonderful customer service during any hotel stay as I did at the Hilton Garden Inn. I will ALWAYS make it a point to stay at this hotel each time I visit family in the area."
Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,5,awesome stay,Looking forward too returning again. Hopefully sooner rather than later.
Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,4,Great location in a nice area of Suffolk.,"Each time I've stayed, the rooms have been clean and comfortable. However, there was no record of my reservation on 2nd trip (made through Expedia), and on recent trip overheard conversation with another guest experiencing the same problem, and his issue was not so much with the lost reservation as with the attitude of the hotel staff. My experience on trip 2 was similar but not quite as contentious. Most competing hotels do not charge for breakfast. This one does."
Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,5,great bed,"the hotel boasts one of the most comfortable beds I have had the pleasure of sleeping on. Also, a well appointed room all around."
Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,1,Vacation,"This hotel is located in a quite area. Within the location of this hotel it offers awesome stores options if you are in need of additional clothing or grocery store items. I've stayed at this location on several occasions but I must say this visit did not rate anywhere near my previous stays. The water in the tub backed up which is gross and unsanitary. The surface in the tub is very slippery which should have better surfacing inside the tub. These experiences has caused me to seek future overnight/weekend stays at other 4 or 5 star hotels in the surrounding area. We went for coffee in the breakfast area, but the coffee seemed to have included undesired coffee grinds, we then chose to go out for breakfast after notifying the staff."
Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,4,Would definitely go back,"the hotel was the lovely. My sister was returning home from deployment in Norfolk via the Naval base. This was in close enough proxmity and was certainly the right price! The staff was very pleasant and helpful. my only complaint is that the hot tub was luke warm at best. other than that, the fitness center was clean, the coffee bar was a nice touch in the lobby, and we even got free cookies (which were delicious!)."
Hilton Garden Inn Chesapeake/Suffolk,5,We needed a quick night's sleep.,"I was very happy. We needed dinner and a quick night's sleep. The area was great and we had many choices for food. Kind of odd there are no glasses in the room, just two foam coffee cups."

Hampton Inn Suites Conroe I45 North,1,Grossest and scariest place I've stayed in.,"Here on business and there are limited choices, so I decided to try this because of the ratings. I arrived and checked in and my door was unlocked. Fingerprints, stains and hairs. This is surface cleaning, so the thought of what hasn't been deep cleaned in a while is scary."
Hyatt House Parsippany/Whippany,5,Girls Nigh,I had stayed here for my girls night birthday celebration and I must say the room was very spacious and clean. The hotel staff was very pleasant and all the amenities we needed were right in this room. I will definitely be using this hotel in the future

"Hampton Inn & Suites Chapel Hill/Durham, Area",4,Good service for midtier motel,"Service is excellent for a midlevel chain motel. Good location right off Hwy 54. Usually decent rates.

Park Inn By Radisson Sharon,1,Allerginn,"We stayed here on our way out to a Midwest trip and it was very unsatisfactory. The pillows were down, which I am extremely allergic to. I tried calling the guest service who didn't answer, twice. Went down physically and they didn't have any allergy free pillows available for use. Recommended that I use bundled up towels to sleep on. The room smelled very bad when we arrived. The only redeeming factor was they had a nice pool / hot tub."
Park Inn By Radisson Sharon,3,Decent place in the middle of nowhere,"There are not many places to stay in this area, so this place is a good place for the night. It certainly beats the lower-priced hotels/motels that are usually offered in remote areas. The room we stayed in was clean and comfortable. There was a buffet breakfast offered in the morning for only 8.75, but after eating it, I wished we would've held out for a Cracker Barrel or even Dunkin' Donuts."
Park Inn By Radisson Sharon,5,Highly recommend!,We stayed here on our way East. The room included a a balcony and a Jacuzzi. The bed was super comfortable. The food and room service were exceptional. Hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.

"Red Roof Plus+ Washington, DC - Alexandria",3,Motel is not what the pictures show,"The ad says that the rooms have been redone and the pictures look great, but in reality we had a poorly patched hole in the bathroom door, rusty tub fixtures, and the obviously new paint was chipping. Comforters looked new, but the sheets were super scratchy. Also, it is a motel style place (which was not clear from the ad), which means people smoke off the balcony outside their room and the air conditioner sucks the gross smoky smell into your room. It was fine for last minute since literally nothing else was available last minute for the night were were staying for business in DC, but normally for an extra 20 bucks you could find something MUCH nicer."
"Red Roof Plus+ Washington, DC - Alexandria",3,Most Comfortable Bed Ever,"This is a budget hotel which has been recently remodeled. No frills, small but clean and neat. We had a king size bed which had the most comfortable mattress of our entire trip! The sheets were crisp and clean, so relaxing after a long day of activities. The area was quiet and we had no safety issues. There is coffee in the lobby which was good. No other food or drink except vending machines, but numerous eating choices on the same street. There is no elevator, but we had a ground floor room, so this wasn't an issue for us. Overall a good value if you are just looking for a place to sleep. We would definitely stay there again."

Best Western Inn Florence,4,very nice,"Our room was very clean, but the bagel for breakfast was very dry. We went there for new years eve and new years day it was real close to Cincinnati we had a blast would definitely go back to this hotel."
Comfort Suites,3,Nice hotel but poor location,"Nice hotel with clean rooms but a very odd location off the Interstate. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was not protected from the abundance of highway noise throughout the night. Additionally, it's not extremely intuitive on how to actually get to the hotel through a very weird access road. And, we thought the parking was limited especially... More"
Courtyard Charlottesville North,4,Not a bad stay,"Stayed at this Courtyard by Marriott for business. The room was clean and spacious. Floor plan was typical for Marriott, I could appreciate the air conditioning unit was not close to the bed. Check-in was seamless. I did not encounter the staff otherwise."

McMenamins Hotel Oregon,4,we love the Hotel Oregon pub.,It was fun to relax with a beer and a great burger and watch bustling 3rd Avenue. We had an enjoyable visit with our college son up from UO and his buddies and our daughter. very enjoyable.
McMenamins Hotel Oregon,1,We have eaten at many other McMenamins,"We have eaten at many other McMenamins before so for my son's birthday we chose the one in McMinnville since we were there for a track meet at Linfield. BIG MISTAKE!!!! Order was screwed up with two meals not delivered until everyone else was through waiters changed in the middle, and the bill charged us one meal too much. Not happy."
McMenamins Hotel Oregon,5,"Fantastic Food, Good Food, Great Service","The place to meet after a long day at UFOfest. I had a very tasty burger with all the trimmings and tried some imaginative beers. Great atmosphere is half the journey to a good meal experience. Try the roof top on a sunny day, relax and watch the clouds go by."
McMenamins Hotel Oregon,5,Rooftop Seating - Amazing!!!,"We were passing through McMinnville on our way to the coast. Thought we would stop for a quick breakfast and be on our way To our surprise we stayed for breakfast and lunch!! The food was excellent, staff exceptional and the location really invites you to linger and investigate. The rooftop bar is so unexpected, relaxing and cool!! Really... More"
McMenamins Hotel Oregon,2,Romance in a creepy place,"We stayed in a Queen with a private bath. Even this room was way too small. When I opened the door, I could barely get my luggage in without hitting the bed. We picked the romance package which came with a bottle of Edgefield sparkling wine, handmade local chocolates and massage oil. Very nice! We didn't eat here because we both feel McMens has grown tired - and there are so many great new restaurants in McMinn. If you like a tiny room with a creepy atmosphere, this place is for you!"
McMenamins Hotel Oregon,3,Needs more renovating,"Stayed here because it was right downtown McMinnville. We were on a wine tour of the Willamette Valley. Never again! The room did have its own bath (you pay extra for that) but it was small, small, small. It smelled dusty, there was barely room to turn around, only a bed and two tiny nighstands. Where do you put the... More"
McMenamins Hotel Oregon,3,Good beer paired with so so food,"Great selection of beers on tap. Salads are fresh and tasty, burgers and sandwiches are okay but too much grease. Ordered Teriyaki bowl swimming in oil like a stew - returned it."
McMenamins Hotel Oregon,5,Historic,My Son took me here while I was on vacation. We ate on the top deck and had a very good meal. Our hostess was awesome and I will definitely go back. We did walk the streets after dark and it was cool to see all of the architecture downtown.
Courtyard San Diego Sorrento Valley,5,Terrific Stay!,"Upon Arrival, I was greeted warmly by Ashlee at the front desk. She knew my first name and that we were there for our daughter's weddding! What a difference from the previous two nites we had spent at the Torrey Pines Hilton.I will review that hotel as well.... For me, it is all about service, and I was so impressed... More"
Courtyard San Diego Sorrento Valley,4,"Great hidden location, in a older refurbished marriott","Older hotel that is in the middle of a commercial business park, stayed for a few days, room was clean and well furnished, walls are a little thin, but that's what you get with an older place. good coffee shop in the lobby, walking distance to Karl Strauss Brew Pub, would stay again."
Courtyard San Diego Sorrento Valley,4,Good hotel,We stayed at this location for one night. It's a nice hotel. The rooms are quite spacious. We were in what probably qualifies as a suite. The bedroom door closes and there is a smallish living room area with a pull out couch. The hotel common areas are very clean and they look very new. The room was the same... More
BEST WESTERN Westfield Inn,1,Hotel,"My wife and I would definitely not recommend this hotel. It was over priced, noisy, and not clean. The only accommodating person was the breakfast attendant. The rates go up a ridiculous amount during the week."
BEST WESTERN Westfield Inn,5,All business,"Located in the sleepy town of Westfield, this Best Western was exactly what it was intended to be. It's a no frills, business orientated hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, the breakfast punctual and delicious, the staff incredibly accommodating and courteous and the location central. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend it to any business travelers."
BEST WESTERN Westfield Inn,5,Best Place to be when in New Jersey,"The staff at Westfield Best Western was very helpful, courteous and accommodating.

You won't be disappointed. The staff go out of there way to accommodate. Kudos to the... More"
Best Western Beach Dunes Inn,1,Cockroaches,Nice location and convenient to the beach. The property is pretty old and outdated. The room had to many cockroaches. Cockroaches were on the desk and in the furniture. Would be nice if the rooms were pest free.

Hotel La Jolla,3,Ok,"Hotel was nice. Had to ask for towels. Room were cleaned late in day. Came back from beach and no clean towels. Wifi cost extra, parking was 35/day to hand them my keys. No complimentary breakfast. Not a 4 star experience. Stayed at a Marriott last year, much better"
Hotel La Jolla,5,Modern hotel with a great in-house restaurant/bar!,"I came down for a work event, and I chose this hotel mainly for its proximity to the event site, but I ended up having dinner at the restaurant on the 11th floor, which offered great happy hour and fantastic views. It was convenient having those options on-site, as I had driven far to get there, and didn't want to have to get back in the car to find a place to eat. My only complaint is that the hotel is valet-only, which results in unexpected expenses because I felt obligated to tip the valet drivers each time, but that's not a huge deal."
Hotel La Jolla,5,Cool but no free wifi,"Such a good trip. Being there with my fiancee to enjoy a little getaway for the weekend was perfect. We couldn't believe the view. The sunset was phenomenal and you can't imagine the sunrise. I just wish we were able to have free-wifi. Sucks to pay but they want to make a profit right Other than that the amenities sounded so great. A free bike, shuttle to downtown, and 24 hour pool. I guess that's where the extra income from the paid wifi goes too Whatever. It was sweet. We loved it and loved how friendly the staff was. They truly care about you and are always ready to help."
Hotel La Jolla,1,DISAPPOINTING don't stay here,It was awful We went for one night as we were grieving and needed to get away First of all the 35 parking fee was ridiculous and your parking attendant sneered at us and said This IS La Jolla. Wow. When I asked the front desk what was the deal with the parking it was just uh yeah sorry. The room 808 was just OK. Altjough we were kept awake by some shenanigans going on in The room above us ALL NIGHT We will not be returning and regret we booked this room in our grief. It did nothing to help.
Rodeway Inn & Suites Boulder Broker,3,Ageing but comfortable,"As other reviewers have noted, this is a hotel that had it heyday in years past but for the price it is still comfortable and will give you a good nights sleep. They offer a breakfast, but I did not take advantage of it. The room was clean, but looked its age. Dark wood and curtains made it seem smaller... More"
Crowne Plaza Columbus-Downtown,4,Happy valentine's day,"Was in town for a convention, and stayed at the Crowne Plaza Downtown. The hotel is very conveniently located adjacent to the Covention Center.

The beds were comfortable. I loved the city views... More
Crowne Plaza Columbus-Downtown,3,"Not the best, not the worst",We only stayed in the hotel one night during a quick trip to Columbus recently.

At one point we did call the front desk clerk who was... More
Crowne Plaza Columbus-Downtown,5,Yearly outing,"Love this hotel. Clean, great location and friendly staff! Hotel bar has great food also.

Crowne Plaza Columbus-Downtown,5,Excellent,"The room was spotless. There was a relaxation pack (complimentary) that had relaxing room spray, scented lotion and a cooling, refreshing oil. The soap, shampoo and lotion in the bathroom were awesome. Check in was easy. Overnight valet parking was 24 but parking is expensive downtown. Front desk service was quick. Very pleased with the room and would definitely stay... More"
Crowne Plaza Columbus-Downtown,5,Best in Town,"I've been coming to conventions in Columbus for several years, this was my first time staying at The Crowne and it is by far superior in all ways. My experience started before check-in. I required special handicap accommodations, so I called the hotel directly to be sure that a couple of things could be prearranged for my room. I asked...

Crowne Plaza Columbus-Downtown,4,Convienent Location,"Located in the Arena District, walking distance from Arena, many restaurants and pubs. Rooms were typical of a hotel layout. Everyone was nice and attached to a restaurant (Max and Erma's) where you got you breakfast."
Four Points by Sheraton San Jose - Silicon Valley,1,COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE,"We booked a wedding block for a group attending a near-by celebration. (Thank goodness the hotel wasn't the wedding venue). From check-in to check out, the experience was a fiasco. Guests didn't get the right rooms, rooms weren't made up room amenities (like shampoo and toilet paper) were non existent and took staff over an hour to bring restaurant was... More"
Four Points by Sheraton San Jose - Silicon Valley,1,Disaster,"Avoid. Nothing good to say. The list goes on and on. Beds not made, no toilet paper, botched room assignments, mixed-up special events. The parking lot has recently been re-paved, everything else is broken. Something is wrong at the top here as evidenced by the total disorganization."
Four Points by Sheraton San Jose - Silicon Valley,2,Mixed feelings.,Location wise it's not bad but this hotel is in need of some renovations. On my visit which was on super bowl weekend only one of the elevators was working. As well on two of the five nights the fire alarm went off with no voice commands over the intercom. The fire doors would close automatically and during the week... More
Four Points by Sheraton San Jose - Silicon Valley,2,"Wet carpert, cigar smoke, room intrusions and more","So I stayed there last week. At first blush it seems pretty similar to all these business hotel chains. I checked in about 5 p.m. and they gave me a room at the end of a looong walk down the corridor. OK, maybe they are full. Then I step into the room, put my carry-on on the dresser, take off... More"

Ok, the wireless internet speed could of been... More"
The Westin San Jose,5,Peaceful Stay,The room was small but very comfortable. Beautiful area with lots shopping!
The Westin San Jose,4,I had better luck at budget hotels,"I normally stay at hotels with 3 star and below ratings and every once in a while I stay at hotels with excellent ratings when I want to be in a downtown area. To be honest, I didn't like the room. Coffee maker, drawers, and the closet was dirty. Front desk staff is average. Location is great for food and entertainment."
Comfort Suites Tampa / Brandon,4,Updated rooms and breakfast had a good selection.,"Undergoing room renovations. Had one of those renovated rooms, very nice . Free Breakfast was very good, included hot items. Some loud guests in the hallway 3am but that can happen anywhere , especially when rates are lower than competition."
Comfort Suites Tampa / Brandon,3,"Expected more, got less","Good points: Had type of room we needed, 2 beds with pull-out sofa, newly remodeled-actually still in process on higher floor, nice breakfast selection, keeps coffee available all day Bad points: Our first assigned room was newly remodeled based on decor and bedding but TV wouldn't work with remote and several small pieces of food stuck to wall by trashcan,...

One of my... More"
Comfort Suites Tampa / Brandon,3,FRIENDLY STAFF,The only thing about this hotel is that the staff is very pleasant. The rooms are clean but very dingy feeling. Bathroom was the same. Nothing to impressive about this comfort suites. The price was way overpriced for the what I had expected.
Residence Inn Jacksonville Butler Boulevard,3,No change due to booking through hotels.com,Chose this hotel because we were sharing the 2 bedroom/ 2 bath unit with elderly parents who were to fly in from DFW area. Bad weather cancelled their flight two days in a row. I called the morning after we checked in to explain situation. We wanted to see if we could get smaller room since it was just the two of us instead of four. Stayed on hold for sometime waiting for manager to get on phone. We were unable to change room because we had booked through Hotels.com.
Best Western Intracoastal Inn,5,Very Comfortable,"My husband, son and I stayed here for three nights last minute.

Best Western Intracoastal Inn,5,Quality staff and treatment,This hotel staff goes out of their way to make you comfortable and satisfied with your stay there.

Comfort Suites,4,"A better than average, but not fantastic stay","We were in town for a Lego League Competition at UTEP. We reserved the hotel for the pool. And of course, it was closed for maintenance when we checked in. It did open the next day, but the pool was why we chose to pay 40 more per night. Service was ok- not outstanding, but not bad either. Just normal service. There were only about 10 channels on the TV and nothing for kids (so I had no pool or TV for the first night after a long day of work and traveling). But the hotel is close to a shopping center and not too far from UTEP so it worked well for what we needed."
Comfort Suites,3,Okay...,"The hotel was average. Rooms were ok. The tub and toilet didn't look as though it had been cleaned. And my bottom deadbolt wouldn't lock. I went to the front desk twice to ask about it, but bith times the desk was empty. Television in tbe room was average, but no indication of what channels were available. Also the two... More"
Comfort Suites,1,Comfort suites,Dirty rooms. Outdated decor. Faulty lights. Bad odor. Terrible breakfast. Would not recommend or stay here again. Disgusting.
Comfort Suites,5,Good stay. Great neighborhood. Easy freeway access,"We stayed in double queen. It was very spacious. The neighborhood was great. Felt very comfortable there. It's a nonresidential area by the freeway with restaurants nearby. The freeway was a little loud in the mornings and there was some construction going on right outside the hotel. They should be done with the construction there in about a week. It woke us up very early one morning. I told the manager about it and he was happy to switch our rooms if we wanted. We chose to stay in the same room. It was less noisy the next morning without the jackhammer going. The kids even enjoyed watching the big excavator going. The even numbered rooms may be less noisy. Breakfast was decent. Scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, waffles, cereal, and donuts. The indoor pool is small. It would maybe fit 15-20 people. There were 12 people when we went and was already getting crowded. Exercise room has an elliptical and recumbent bike only. The staff were very nice. We would stay there again."
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,2,"Close tot he airport, but pretty poor condition","Very worm out room, close to the airport, but the smell in the room was unpleasant"

Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,5,outstanding,The manager that night was excellent.
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,5,great stay,The hotel was very clean and the room was comfortable. Off the main drag so there wasn't a lot of traffic noise. The only downfall is that there isn't a continental breakfast. They did have a cupboard where you could purchase food and other items which helped out.
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,3,Standard Candlewood,Standard Candlewood hotel. Nice and clean. Room was nice and comfortable.
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,4,A very pleasant stay in Norfolk!,"I booked this stay with my mother, sister and niece. The hotel was in a great location and close to many conveniences. The staff were always pleasant and helpful. The free Laundromat was also a huge plus. As our visit was for 10 days, the kitchenette in the room proved very convenient and we were also happy to notice that the hotel was not noisy. My only negative was that the hotel windows could not open and sometimes it proved difficult to get the air conditioning at a comfortable setting. Overall a great stay!"
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,5,"very clean, accessible, No breakfast, No pool",great.
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,3,Close to beach if you can ever check-in to go.,"I had high hopes for this hotel. Yes, it is a 2 star but others give it a good rating. So I thoght this would be a good place to stay. When we first arrived at around 330 pm, the outside of the hotel was well kept so things looked promising. The lobby was clean and smelled nice. When I went to check in there was first a delay because the customer in front of me room was not ready. Then I found out my room wasn't ready. I was asked to leave my so they could call me when it was. They suggested I go drive around until then with gas prices so high. We came back at 5 pm and the room still wasn't ready. We sat in the hot car for another hour before they finally just offered us two single rooms instead of the queen double we prepaid for, stating they sold out of those rooms. We lost a whole day of our vacation simply b/c we weren't able to check-in until nearly 4 hours after the stated time. We didnt get to the beach until late so my kids only got tospend about an hour in the water. Check-out was no better. It was supposed to be at noon, but a male housekeeper came into my room at 1130 without knocking ready to turn the room over. Luckily I wasn't indisposed or anything. Then, the front desk tried to charge me a second time for the room. The room was nice, however. I would have considered staying thre again if those things didn't happen."
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,5,Norfolk Airport Candlewood Suites,Very nice! Accesability of bathroom was well thought out. As a handicapped person I can ALWAYS tell when the design of a space was done by a non handicapped person.
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,5,"The Candlewood Suites Hotel in Norfolk, VA",I find that Candlewood Suites offers an excellent stay for the price. It is better much than a lot of more expensive hotels. The hotel is always very clean. It offers the best in creature comforts and each room is very well organized for business travel.
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,4,Nice Clean Hotel Close to Airport,Hotel is very clean. Has good WiFi and is close to the airport. I would stay here again when in the Norfolk area.
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,4,"Nice hotel, other guests, not so much","My first impression was that the lobby was full of pimps and hookers! The hotel was very nice, very clean but the guys standing by the door asking if they could bum a cigarette as I checked in with my 3 small sons skeeved me out a little bit. The room was clean, beds comfortable, towels fluffy, we checked in at 11.30pm and were out by 9am so it was a place to sleep and nothing else."
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,3,Good location and facilities,Good location and facilities. One thing that was a little negative was that the room smelled a little. Perhaps from people cooking Had a nice little exercise room and the internet was amazingly fast!!! Overall a good experience!!
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,5,Very excited to go back. The hospitality was the best!,"Target, Wal-Mart, food establishments are in walking distance. The airport is 10 mins away and the shuttle is always available. The property is brand new, every inch of the suite/room was magnificent with the marble in the bathroom. I washed clothes (complimentary wash/dry). Loved it. Workout room has all the up-to-date equipment. Front desk hospitality from beginning to end of my stay. I'm from Los Angeles/Orange County, California, and a very neat and clean person. I will most definitely be back. The drive to Virginia Beach is very close, freeways are right at the location. Highest recommendation and respect for this hotel."
Candlewood Suites Norfolk Airport,4,Nice hotel for MEAC week at Norfolk scope,"Check in was quick, efficient. Room was large, well appointed, kitchen area, separte bedroom. Free self parking Only down side was bedroom TV did not work and set up two wake up calls that never happened."

SpringHill Suites Norfolk Old Dominion University,2,Disappointed,We stayed at the SpringHill Suite Norfolk Old Dominion University for our daughter's graduation.

We checked in Shaneel at the front desk was amazing. An asset to the... More
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,There is a very nice supermarket nearby.,"It is a very quiet , comfortable and safe hotel. The hotel have a small inside pool and a very good hot tube. My family like it."

Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,4,Destination a considerer pour Virginia Beach,"Agreable sejour avec la famille, personnel agreable et accueillant, dejeuner copieux (buffet) mais sofa-lit tres inconfortable. Destination recommandee pour famille avec enfants et petit budget mais un peu loin de la plage. Mais d'un autre cote, distance suffisante pour endormir les enfants au retour de la plage et se proteger des bruits des nuits chaudes de Virginia Beach."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,Family weekend get away,"It's for our weekend get away, and it was a pleasant stay at Homewood Suites. Will go back there."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,Fantastic suite!,"Our party of 4 adults and 1 child had plenty of space to spread out and be comfortable in the spacious 2-bedroom suite. Friendly, courteous staff. Excellent amenities, including executive putt-putt course, TV club room, 24-hr convenience shop, and business center. Good breakfast and complimentary internet was a plus. An all-around pleasant hotel stay."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,great place,"My family loved this hotel. Good continental breakfast and free dinner on weekdays. Kids enjoyed the indoor pool. Room is large , clean and has central air instead of those loud a/c units. The only negative for me was that the bed was too hard."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,Perfect choice for daughters birthday pool party,"All the kids enjoyed the nice size pool, comfy beds, and great breakfast. We had a blast and there was more than enough room to get our just dance 4 groove on! Can't wait til next year:)"
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,Very nice hotel. Staff very kind and professional.,Felt like home. Would definitely stay here again. Great free breakfast! Very comfortable suites.
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,Great room for the money,"Not only myself, but my family loved this hotel and we will return again. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants good service as well as a nice, clean hotel stay:) The rooms were excellent and very comfortable. The breakfast buffet was awesome and I loved the pool/jaccuzi and computer room. Onsite laundry is recommended as well as the room service. Great location as there were many restaurants nearby. If I could change anything, it would be the structure of the hotel room (to include more privacy for a family of four...door or divider). Best hotel I've stayed at in a very long time!"
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,Encore une excellente experience au Homewood,"Il s'agissait de notre troisieme experience a cet hotel et nous avons encore une fois ete tres bien servis et surtout tres bien recus. Si nous retournons en Virginie dans les prochaines annees, nous ne chercherons pas ailleurs."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,4,A Nice Stay,"Overall this is a very nice hotel with well appointed suites. We were in town for a couple of family functions so we didn't use most of what was available in either the room or the other facilities that were offered by the hotel. A couple of comments an not really complaints are that the fitted sheet on the bed was put on the bed inside out and was not fitted very well to the mattress (it just looked kind of sloppy) and there were spatter marks on the wall next to the bed that looked like they could have easily been wiped away. The rest of the room appeared to be very clean. They were even steam cleaning the carpets in the hallways while we were there. All of the staff was very friendly. Each of the housekeepers we met in the hall always gave us a friendly greeting. The breakfast offered a good variety and everything seemed fresh. A buffet meal is offered Monday through Thursday but we were not there on those days to be able to comment other than to say what was on the monthly menu posted in the room looked pretty good. The hotel is close to the airport , about 10 minutes to Virginia Beach Town Center, and only a 15 minute drive to Virginia Beach. It is located in an industrial park and is conveniently located near numerous dining and shopping facilities."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,Awesome,The staff and hotel were great. I would stay here again.
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,Great Hotel,"Excelent hotel very clean, great for families,couples or single persons will difenitely stay there agian hotel was worth every dollar spent on"
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,2,Business Trip not up to standard.,I book this travel for 2 of our employees for a 2 day business trip. Upon arrival they discovered one of the rooms had no bathroom light. When they contacted the desk they were asked what time they needed to take a shower because maintenance was gone. The staff seemed to not want to change his room or repair the light. After this employee got upset they then moved his room. This was a 10pm at night. The other rooms A/C was set to the lowest 60 and never got below 74. So the employee who was working in very hot conditions all day couldn't even cool off at night. Then there was the dinner. The employees found that dinner was two bowls of meat balls from 5-7pm. Nothing was replenished or taken care of. The signed in the hotel were wrong. Signed said vending but there was no vending that could be found. I was very embarrassed to have been the one to have booked this location for these two employees. I take pride in making sure all our employees have the nicest most reasonable stay possible when they have to travel for work. Now I am ashamed of this trip.
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,More Turkey,Need a little more turkey items on the menu everyone doesn't always eat pork.
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,3,HopeB in VA,Efficient front desk staff. Clean rooms. Nice floorplan. Convenient to interstate and surrounding community. Lots of restaurants and stores in the vicinity.
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,The room was lovely,"Neighborhood is quite dicey and not close to anything. The front desk clerk acted like I was bothering him when I checked-in and did not invite us to the complimentary afternoon happy hour or explain breakfast availablilty. The cleaning staff did a very good job when they bothered to show up. The room was beautiful and included full-size fridge, dishwasher, microwave and all the utensils and dishware that we could have needed. Washer and dryer for guest use on 1st floor. DOG friendly!"
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,Thank you,AC died in the house...used my Hilton honors rewards to get a great rate. The general manager personally called to make sure our stay was going well. Fantastic service from all.

Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,4,Pleasant stay,I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. It is only about 10 miles from the oceanfront. The hotel offers many more amenities than anyone could get on the oceanfront for this price!
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,4,Convenient for the beach and Va Beach Ampitheater,We were looking for a hotel that was convenient to the Va Beach ampitheater. This fit beautifully for what we were looking for. The only downside was that the sink had dark hair near the rim of the sink (perhaps from a man shaving) that the cleaners must not have been able to see. The staff were helpful in finding a restaurant. The icemaker on our floor did not work but the staff filled our cooler from the icemaker in the kitchen.
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,5,Very nice hotel close to the beach.,"Our experience at the Homewood Suite was very good. The hotel was very clean. The room we had was very spacious, it accommodated 4 adults 2 children and a puppy. We are very very happy in our choice to go with the Homewood Suite .. Our next trip to Virginia we will stay at the Homewood Suite."
Homewood Suites by Hilton Virginia Beach/Norfolk Airport,4,like home,Great hotel makes you feel like you are right at home!
Fiddler's Inn,2,Meh!,The room was what you pay for. It reeked of smoke and the Internet was weak and intermittent. The staff was friendly and they have a continental breakfast. Close to the Opry Mills Mall and lots of food options.
Fiddler's Inn,2,Suffice,"Well, I'm stayed in much better motels and some worse, though I made do with this one. First off they put me in a room that had not been serviced since the last guest. Walked in and like wow, is someone in here! Obviously they were long gone but not a good feeling. Called the front desk and they put me in another room. My new room seemed clean, though motel in general is a little run down. Motel itself is actually 3 separate buildings and I was in the south one. Area is fine and I felt safe walking around outside at night. Couple of real good honky tonks right next door (recommend Nashville Palace), though down side if you want peace and quiet you won't get it until they close up at around 2am. The outside pool is across the parking lot right up beside a Bar and Grill (Scoreboard - another fine honky tonk), though not like I was going to partake in outside pool in January anyway though is strange where the pool is located. By far the best about this motel is the location. Everything you need is within walking distance. All in all it was okay though not sure I would take family to stay there, though good for just me and would stay there again. All depends on your level of expectations, if they are low to average, you should be fine, if high, go somewhere else. Get what you pay for."
Fiddler's Inn,5,Great Value for a quick Nashville getaway.,The staff was top notch. From the desk manager to the cleaning ladies everyone was friendly and eager to help. Great attitudes. The WiFi was slow and eventually just turned back to 4G. The Breakfast was a get there early thing but it was free. The rooms were not new but everything was clean. And you had a good choice of walk to live music from the hotel.
Fiddler's Inn,1,Hotel was not what we expected it didn't have the,terrible staff was hateful air condition didn't work and the rooms were not cleaned
Fiddler's Inn,3,conveniently comfortable,breakfast was pitiful. tv and reception poor!

Ramada Naples,4,Crisp linens and immaculate landscaping.,"The linens were very clean, and the pool area was beautiful. The entire desk staff was eager to give on point recommendations for dining and attractions. Great value for the price paid. Request ground floor- there is no elevator."
Ramada Naples,5,work stay,the Ramada is a great place to stay away from home. I travel for work and need a clean and affordable place to sleep. I bring my wife when we come to Naples because of the clean and quiet settings .. I will always stay here when I come for work or relaxation. Karl the Chairman 561-596-5165
Silver Sands Beach Resort,2,Travel back in time,Hotel was probably built in the 50's. Needs serious update. Not really clean but not too terribly filthy. Landscaping was nice in the garden area and the pool was fairly nice but showed its age. The plus side is that you are literally steps away from the beach. We only stayed one night because we didn't sleep very well in... More

San Francisco Marriott Marquis,4,Good hotel - No pool - charge to use the sauna.,"The hotel was good, not great. I didn't feel pampered - but I was comfortable (I think it supposed to be a 4 star hotel). The nice thing is that its close to the shopping mall which has a grocery store on the lower level! The mall also has a great food court also you can easily stock your room. The hotel staff was very nice and accommodating. I would stay here again. However!!!! Get rid of the 7.00 charge to use the sauna, it's ridiculous moreover, they can't possibly be making any 'real' profit off of a 7.00 dollar charge."

San Francisco Marriott Marquis,4,"Great Hotel, Valet Parking can be Slow","Great hotel in the heart of Union Square at a very reasonable rate. We were attending an event at ATT park and Earlier that day we devided to stay in the SF overnight. The Marquis had rooms available, at a great rate and close to ATT (9.00 UBER ride). The hotel is beautiful and our room was immaculate. Staff is very friendly and kind. The only negative was on the day of our arrival, we waited on Mission Street for an hour to have valet park our car. The valet attendants were very apologetic and the desk clerk upon hearing how long it took, gave us an early check-in. I would most definitely stay here again!"

Lexington Inn - Ardmore,5,Amazing hotel!,Amazing hotel! Great location! Starbucks and lots of restaurants were right down the road. The hotel has been newly renovated so everything is nice and new.

Lexington Inn - Ardmore,2,Not worth the money,"Room smelled musty. No elevator, and very second rate breakfast. Definitely not worth the price."
Lexington Inn - Ardmore,2,"Expected something better, got worse","This hotel was newly renovated, which made me expect something better. The room smelled awful, and there were dead crickets on our bathroom floor. The decor had in the room had in fact been updated. The bathroom had old tiles old tub old toilet with a new vanity top and mirror. Everything else was obviously old. Our black out curtains were held together with paper clips, we could hear EVERYTHING going on in the room next to us, the hallway, and upstairs! When any doors would shut, our room would loudly vibrate. Our check in clerk was very nice and she tried to help us with anything we needed... Also, no elevator and my parents who are elder, were placed upstairs, making it hard to get them and their luggage to their room! This simply was an emergency place to sleep, but I clearly overpaid, because it was no better than Motel 6 (and it was double the price)"

Pittsburgh Marriott City Center,5,My first choice in Pittsburgh,Room is a little bit spendy at close to 200/night but it's a nice big room with a desk and a couch. Looks like a junior suite but it doesn't have the 2nd TV in front of the couch. If there's a negative it's that you can hear some traffic noise outside the windows. Get a higher floor to mitigate....

Wyndham Garden Pittsburgh Airport,4,Getting better every year,We stayed here last year about this time to catch an early flight out of Pittsburgh. You can tell that the hotel is in the process of being renovated. Our room was done and looked great. The outside of the hotel was also being painted. The shuttle driver told us that the hotel was recently under new management and a lot of items that were left by the former management is now getting done.

Wyndham Garden Pittsburgh Airport,1,Very poorly ran hotel.,"Bad experience. Most of the employees live at the hotel. Lady bartender was great but apparently the system in the restaurant went down all weekend so no food and very inconvenient to leave hotel to get food as the hotel is tucked way off in an industrial park.

Quality Inn Suites,3,Mixed Review,"Cold shower, comfy bed."
Quality Inn Suites,3,Subpar,"There were stink bugs on the curtains! The front desk was somewhat quick to come remove one or two. But by the end of the night, I had removed three myself. The complimentary breakfast was typical, although I would have enjoyed some toppings for the oatmeal. No one bothered to clear the entrance/exit driveway, which is a steep hill, after 6 inches of snow. There was no other hotel close enough to move to, as I was there for business."
Quality Inn Suites,4,Portsmouth weekend,"Met a group of guys down in Portsmouth for a weekend of NSW training. Didn't spend a ton of time at the hotel but I was pleased with my stay. The room was very clean. Had a nice comfortable king bed. Plenty of room. Had a couch as well. Breakfast wasn't all that. Had a waffle maker, eggs, sausage, sausage sandwiches, cereal, bagels, toast etc.. the sausage was that microwave junk. ate it the first morning but that was it. I didn't check anything else in the hotel out or have a need to seek service. I would stay there again."
Hiway Inn Express,1,WORST OF THE WORST,"I am not sure who wrote the reviews on this place nor when they were written. evidently they have not been there recently.

Motel 6 Texarkana TX,1,Scary Place,I agree with everybody that rated this hotel low. It is pretty bad my wife did not feel safe and the room had a musty smell. Staff was ok but location and people around was scary. We ate our dinner and promptly left. Did not even bother try to get our money back.

Mesa View Inn,1,Poor Management,The manager uses foul language referring to poorly trained staff. Staff does not know how to issue credits after they fail to honor the rate quoted. The rooms are poorly cleaned with light bulbs burned out and never replaced. Staff consists of young children that cannot make decisions nor are mature enough to deal with challenges.

Portland Regency Hotel & Spa,5,Lovely stay,"First rate staff and facility. We were ending a long and somewhat stressful trip, and this was a welcome place to unwind and recover. The staff truly could not do enough to make us comfortable. What a pleasure to be in a place where they use metal keys! No lockouts with a magnetic key after 2 or 3 days, as happens in other places.

Portland Regency Hotel & Spa,4,Underground room,Room 116 was a nice sized room with a couch and a king bed. The only downside was that it was basement level. Our window looked out to the knees of passer-by's which meant that we had to keep the blinds closed or people would look down into our room. Zero privacy. Otherwise the hotel was nice and the staff did a good job. No complaints.

Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa,4,Right in the heart of it all,"We always have a positive experience at Saratoga Springs. The Congress Park section of the resort is within easy walking distance of Disney Springs (formerly Downtown Disney) and even closer now with a new pedestrian bridge. Additionally, there is a little used entrance off Buena Vista drive that makes for easy in/out near hotel row."
Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa,5,GREAT!!!!!,Originally we were at Disney's Port Orleans French Quarter. Our room had a broken bed and we were not satisfied with it. The hotel manager then moved us to this resort. EVERYTHING about it was GREAT from the time we arrived. The front desk rep was extremely helpful even the manager who apologized over and over for the broken bed... More
Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa,4,Disney trip 2012,"Traveled Jan 2012 with mother in law and my 2 kids. We stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, very nice little place, very clean and spacious all the comforts of home. The pool was nice for the kids, liked that there was always a bus coming around to bring you to the different Disney park attractions."
Disney's Saratoga Springs Resort & Spa,5,Great for family,"We rented a two bedroom suite, as Florida residents. This was a very clean and well laid out for our family trip. The bedrooms were split to reach side of the common area, one being a king with hot tub and big bathroom. The other side had two queen beds with a second bath and we ordered a crib, while... More"
Best Western Plus Lacey Inn & Suites,5,"Great staff, breakfast and room",This is one of the best employee and breakfast experiences you are going to get in the Lacey area. I have started to choose this over more opulent places if I am allowed to choose it for work. The staff are top-notch friendly and the breakfast is one of the best I've experienced.
Best Western Plus Lacey Inn & Suites,5,An excellent week,"We had a wonderful week at the Best Western in Lacey. Each day they would have different breakfast foods which was great. The room was very comfortable, the only issue was the size of the pillows. I thought they were too small for a king size room. I asked about them, but that was all they had. We would still... More"
Best Western Plus Lacey Inn & Suites,4,Excellent value and service,"We stayed here for a sports tournament recently. Compared to the experience of families who stayed at nearby hotels, our stay was fine. The breakfast set up was better than usual at inexpensive breakfast-included hotels. The fitness facility is simple but functional. the pool was clean and the rooms were spotless and comfortable."
Best Western Plus Lacey Inn & Suites,5,Always a good place to stay,"We have spent a number of nights at this motel. It is always very clean, breakfast above average, friendly staff. When we checked out we mentioned how heavy the bed covers were. We were told we should have requested a lighter cover, as we were not the only ones to talk about this one problem. Great for cold weather. Not... More"
Best Western Plus Lacey Inn & Suites,5,A new stopping point',"When travelling to see family, we've taken to stopping near our destination the night before to give the kids the opportunity to swim and unwind from the long trip instead of showing up cranky and tired from driving. It has really worked out for us. Our 'normal' hotel had a problem with their pool, so we chose to stay at... More"
Best Western Plus Lacey Inn & Suites,5,fine place to stay,"WE stay here every time we come to Olympia. Great service, wonderful staff, very clean rooms, best breakfast we have found in our travels. Lots of stores around within walking distance. A ten minute drives to old town."
Best Western Plus Lacey Inn & Suites,5,5 star experience,"This is a friendly, courteous, clean, comfortable hotel with a terrific breakfast. A 5-star family hotel that is also in a convenient location. We appreciated being able to open a window for fresh air. The king room is really comfortable and convenient with sitting area. Wifi worked smoothly. Looking forward to returning."
Best Western Plus Lacey Inn & Suites,5,Excellent,"We love staying at this hotel. It's close to a casino, food and has a great pool/spa for the kids. We choose to have weekend fun nights here - it's close to outdoor activities that we enjoy and the town of Lacy is super cute."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Great service,Everyone on staff was great and continued to be helpful and just excellent customer service Breakfast bat crew also great
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Wonderful Staff,"The staff at the hotel were all so friendly and welcoming. Bed was extremely comfortable and the noise level was great, barely heard anyone in the hallways. The bathroom had some water damage in it and the room was a bit dated but, nothing terrible. Would definitely stay here again."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Staycation,"My boyfriend and I were celebrating our 5 year anniversary this past weekend. The hotel lobby was beautiful, clean and have a very welcoming vibe. The staff was extremely pleasant! Our room was clean, super cute and cozy. We had an adjoining room so we could hear the guest next door from time to time but it was not a bother what so ever. Overall our local get away was a much needed break from real life and this hotel provided the perfect space to relax, feel comfortable and enjoy the weekend."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Satisfied guests,We will return. It was just wonderful. Customer service was very much on point.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,It was Wonderful until...,Everything was Wonderful until I saw that there was a Blood line on the side of the Tub... I told the Front Desk about it... Also We had to moved to another room because of Toilet Problems but I fount a Blood line at the other room.. I was contacted about it or Did anyone Higher the the Front Desk person Apologized to me and My family for anything.. Nor did I receive any type of discount.. I'm getting ready to stay there again... I Love it other than that Problem that We had... Thanks
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Nice stay! (but A/C noise from other rooms),"At check in, the staff was most friendly and helpful. There only one night, my suite was clean and comfortable. Beds were very good (wimpy pillows though). Only negative was the noise of another's air conditioning unit running for hours. That type of noise should not be heard at all! Overall, I would recommend Springhill Suites!!"
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,1,Blood stained sheets,"I took my significant other to Springhill Suites for a weekend of relaxation for his birthday and I was very disappointed. When we decided to lay down there was a blood stain on 2 different sheets. We also did not use the shower because it was a grey film covering the bottom of the bathtub. I also think there was a laundry room next to us due to all of the noise and banging early in the morning. Overall, the cleanliness of the room was a problem, but the front desk staff was very friendly!! oh and I could've done without the breakfast!!"
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,We had a great experience,"Staff were friendly, bed were comfortable, room was clean and had pretty decent complimentary breakfast. The only complaint was the cloudy and dirty indoor pool My kids and I were planning to do a morning swim but we're disappointed with the pool condition :("
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Convenience to Sentara Leigh Hospital,"Yes, it was convenient and our expectations of a Marriott property that were well met. Our room was spacious and very adequate, and in fact exceeded our expectations. Henry Jones checked us in with cordial and competent ease. The evening was restful and uneventful, the breakfast was exceptional. It is a 4 star hotel."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Amazing Breakfast!!!,I forgot the name for the lady serving/putting-out breakfast but she provided excellent customer service and that's hard to find now-in-days.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Close enough to the beach and Shoppings,"My stay was good. I recommended the hotel to a friend because we were vacationing together. Her room had a strong smell and we were told it was coming from the pipes under the kitchenette sink. After complaining she was moved. She was offered several other rooms but they were dirty. The carpet and bathrooms look horrible. After she was shown several, (about 10 rooms) she settle on the cleanest she could find. I know you're a franchise, but when you using the Marriott name the hotel should be cleaner. Need another toaster. Only one toaster for the entire hotel. My eggs were cold before my bagel/bread was toasted. I was my second time there. I would stay there again. Hope I will never have the same problems as my girlfriend."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Perfect!!,"My stay with SpringHill Suites was amazing! Beautiful Suite, very clean, the staff was friendly and the breakfast was great."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Very Nice Christmas Stay!,"The front desk person was extremely nice and helpful. He allowed us to change our room three times before we (my wife who's pregnant) settled on a room that was easy to walk to and from elevator, able to see vehicle from room window, and right side orientation. The free breakfast buffet was a BIG plus! The indoor pool and hot tub were clean and very nice to enjoy with visiting family for Christmas!"
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Friendly find close to Beach and City,The hotel staff was wonderful. The room was comfortable and spacious. Good value.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Understaffed,"Nice hotel, but not enough people working there, which made check-in a drawn-out experience."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Not in a very nice part of town.,Front desk weren't well informed about payment - I usually pay when I check out but they wanted the cash up front before I was even finished checking in.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,"Beautiful, clean, friendly staff","This was the nicest SpringHill Suites I've stayed at. Beautiful lobby and room, the staff were all very friendly and helpful, and the price was awesome for summertime. The airport shuttle was quick and efficient. The hotel was very clean. I'd definitely recommend you staying here."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,"Nice staff, but wouldn't go back","Overall the hotel, area and staff are nice. But my first stay at this hotel was in December only to find that we had tiny ants all over our room, including our suitcase the next morning...YUCK! The hotel was very apologetic and offered me a free stay next time we were in the area. I took them up on the offer and would have thought the room they put me in would have been checked first, but yep you guessed it...ants again (in February and on a completely different floor)! I think it's time they called an exterminator! They moved me to a different room, but offered nothing else. Won't go back."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Accessible. Great customer service.,Pleasant and accommodating. It was the perfect rest stop while on business.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,1,Bugs Bugs Bugs,"Other than the staff, this was the worst hotel experiences I and my traveling companions have ever had. Per the hotel manager there was an ant infestation they had resolved, they had not. Both my sister and I received several bug bites. Hoterl staff was nonesistent. We came back after being out and the one trash can was empied but sittting in the living area, the toilet paper had not been stocked and towels were left on top of our luggage as opposed to hung in the appropriate area, the toilet overflowed the first time we used it. And finally and most disgusting was that a used condom was ound in one of the nightstands (ewww). Now on to the facilities. The levator was out of order one night, unruly and unsupervised children were left to run roughshod over the pool area. We were subjected to splashes in our face, yelling and our belongings being knocked over (staff did not come to check even though everal adults complained). We spent a total of a half hour of our 3 day stay in the whirlppl finally giving up to sit on the sun deck in order to have some peace and quiet. Only issue with staff was when my sister went to the fornt desk to ask for a hand towel so that she could wipe the sweat of her face(August in Virgina is hot as Hades) and the desk personnel told her that they did not have any and gave her a bat mat instead. To reiterate, the entire experience beyond the pleasant staff was horrific... DO NOT STAY HERE!!!"
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,First time in Norfolk,In town overnight to attend a funeral. Nice hotel. Staff was very friendly.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,"great stay, good fresh breakfast","nice accommodations, friendly staff"
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Nice comfortable stay,We have stayed there several times. Very comfortable and relaxing environment.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Some deep cleaning is in order,"The hotel itself wasn't bad. The location worked for my purpose and the lobby was clean, staff friendly, etc. my room was a bit on the gross side. The couch had stains on it, the rug by the bathroom looked like someone missed and in the morning the toilet backed up, confirming my impression of the rug stains. I couldn't wait to get to the next stop so I could feel clean again!"
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,"Great, new hotel","This appeared to be a brand new hotel. It is extremely clean, bright and modern. They have a guest laundry on the 3rd floor that you can do yourelf. It costs 1.50 to wash and also to dry. The only complaint I had about that was there was no change machine in the laundry room, so I had to make a trip downstairs for that. They have a computer off the lobby where you can easily get on the internet for free. That was great to check emails, print out maps, etc. The breakfast there is included but ends at 9 a.m., which for vacationing families seemed very early. The breakfast was OK, but the same every day. The lobby is great, (you actually eat breakfast in the lobby area.) The workout room was very nice. It was large and actually had free weights, not just the usual treadmill. My son and I swam in the indoor pool one night and were the only ones in it. When you first walk in the pool area, it feels like a sauna, but is very nice to feel when you get out soaking wet. The location is right off 264, and it took us only about 10 minutes to get downtown and the same to get to the beach. There are really no restaurants real close by except for Ruby Tuesdays which is basically in the parking lot. You can walk there. The rooms are huge, plenty of room for a family to spread out. The furnishings are very pretty (artwork, lamps, curtains). They have music playing in the hallways near the elevators (which are very large as well.) Overall, this place was great."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Ausgezeichnetes Hotel,Ausgezeichnetes Hotel. Sehr freundliches Personal. Wurde jederzeit wieder hier ubernachten.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,1,Did not clean my room,"My brother was in the hospital, and I needed to be there for him. Did not want anything problems until this hotel was not very satisfying. The first night, the hotel only took the trash out in my room. So I made a comment to the front desk, is this unusually just to take the trash out. So she made a note to the cleaning dept. The next night my room was not cleaned at all, so you can imagine how upset I was. One night not cleaned, but two nights. When I complaint again, the front desk just told me it's not there problem. It's the cleaning employees so this upset me even more. They did give me some clean towels for that night so I can shower. Also, I felt the breakfast area was not kept up with the cleaning. Very messy. I would not recommend to stay here. But I did have a king size bed, and it was very comfortable."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Mini Fourth of July Vacation,"Great stay with a few minor discomforts The toilet stopped working and they sent up a maintenance worker with a plunger for us. we tried to plunge it but it didn't work. Went to the service desk the next morning but our request for help wasn't recorded and we had to submit another request. Maintenance worker came up and fixed the clog but before anyone fixed it my family had to go to the restroom near the lobby. On another note, Breakfast was great and kitchen staff was welcoming."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,A little disappointed,"My husband and I stayed at this hotel overnight on our way back from a trip to NC from PA. We arrived after the normal check-in time, but we had to wait a few minutes for our room to be ready. After we settled in for the evening, one of the neighboring rooms occupants were having an argument. They proceeded to slam their door and yell in the hallway on and off for 30 minutes. They were loud enough to wake my husband over the television. When we left our room the next morning, the hallway reeked of marijuana and cheap air freshener. We were getting an early start on our traveling and even though the hotel offered a continental breakfast, nothing was available (not even coffee) before 7:00 am."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,it could've been better,"Overall our stay was decent. However, I would've rated it higher if the indoor pool was clean and usable. It was GREEN and smelled unkept which was disappointing with 2 children. In addition, the bathroom could've been cleaner. The toilet bowl was cleaned and the shower curtain was moldy. On a positive note, the staff was EXTREMELY friendly and the complimentary breakfast was quite yummy"
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Top Notch Service and Server!!!!,"We stayed three nights at the Springhill Suites Nov 19-22. I was greeted by very courteous staff at check in, a kind gentleman started the lobby fire for us and the facility was clean and most comfortable. The most impressive person there was DeCalvin Wilson. He served each morning at the delicious and varied deluxe continental breakfast and even came and cleared away our dishes in the expansive dining area. This young man went out of his way to care for the customers - I felt I was at the Ritz Carlton (or at least what it would be like if I could afford it). Give DeCalvin a raise and promotion. No he did not solicit such praise - I was just impressed and wrote his name down. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Met my needs,"Friendly staff, clean comfortable room... Convenient location offering easy access to highway... The early morning breakfast was a nice pitstop before heading over to the hospital. I will make it a point to stay here again the next time I'm in town...."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Mini Family Vacay,We stayed for the weekend and made trips back and forth to the beach. It's about a 20 minute drive to the beach but we didn't run into any traffic. The continental breakfast was great! The hotel staff was great! Definitely would stay again!
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Great Stay,My son was coming home from Deployment. The staff was very helpful and very attentive to our family! Will definitely stay again :)
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,nice hotel,room layout is very ideal as kids slept on pullout and we had separated king bed. tv swivels both ways!
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Nice hotel,"Good location. Close to highway. Close to shopping and lots of nice restaurants on 58. Easy drive to zoo, Nauticus, USS Wisconsin, Botanical Gardens, Aquarium. Save money and purchase savings pass that gets you into 4 major attractions. About 60 mins to Williamsburg. Hotel is clean, free breakfast with good selections and changes every couple of days."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,"Spring Hill Hotel Norfolk, VA","Oustanding hotel, clean and spacious. However, hotel cannot be found on GPS."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Very dissatisfied,"Everything was great, until I woke up to get a drink from the fridge. I turned on the light to find roaches running around in the kitchenette. Very upset."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Good for a night's rest.,"Nice room, convenient kitchenette, great breakfast. A good stop-off for travelers."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Enjoyed stay until trash was found.,"I must say that the hotel met my standards of comfort, space but cleanliness was not so good. The housekeeping staff must be retrained and maybe the hotel should hire dedicated people to clean rooms thoroughly. I found 2 bags of trash in the cabinet from previous tenants (SURPRISED FACE)and the shower curtain was in poor condition. This discovery made me feel that the hotel staff zips in and out rooms, and not cleaning properly."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Just a rest.,I got this room for my wife to have a little alone time and even though I did not stay the nights with her I did join her for breakfast and did spend time with her in the room. I was a beautiful room and my wife said the bed was very comfortable. I would like to thank the staff for their kindness and professionalism. Kudos to this establishment.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Glad it was there,"Was clean, comfortable and close to the hospital. I could not share in breakfast so a discount for us would have made us happier with the cost."
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,One night stay,We stayed only 1 night having a very late flight. The staff was extremely helpful. Our room was very nice and comfortable. Breakfast was really good. Lots of free parking. Great location. Would stay again.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,One for the favorites,Great hotel. Clean and comfortable with a very good breakfast.
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,will definitely return!,loved it
SpringHill Suites by Marriott Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,will stay again,"Great looking and clean and friendly! Good value for the money and a nice part of town, too! Easy off and on the highway nearby. Lots of good places to eat very close by. Stayed nearby once before and glad we tried something different this time."
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,4,No complimentary Breakfast,It was great but I usually book places where's there is a complimentary breakfast. I would not stay there again.

Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,Excellent Hotel,The room was very nice. I can't think of a way it could have been improved. The staff has pleasant and eager to please. I highly recommend this hotel.
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,Convenient Location,We were visiting our daughter and found this hotel online. It was conveniently located for the activities that we planned for the weekend.

Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,clean and comfortable,"Location, cleanliness, service great! Loved the pool and spa! Only problem was an extra charge on my debit card that they did not tell me about, will call and straighten it out tomorrow!"
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,Great Stay for Our Getaway,My husband and I decided to go down to Hampton for a weekend over Valentines Day. We had a great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. They were all very friendly and we got in real late on our first night and the check in process was smooth and stil friendly at 1:00am. I was glad to know that I was receiving the same service at 1:00am checking in as I would have during a normal check in hour. The room was so comfortable and clean. We loved our stay and it was close to all the near by attractions.
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,excellent,"easy check in, comfortable stay, friendly hotel staff, would definitely stay again"
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,Babe's Bday Celebration,My first time here and I absolutely loved it!! We definitely will be coming back!
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,Nice hotel will stay next time in town,The rooms was excellent the breakfast was great with a very good price.
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,3,"Hilton Garden Inn - Hampton, VA","did not meet my expectations at all! I've stayed with this chain before and was impressed, but not this time! The eggs on the breakfast buffet were inedible and the staff disorganized and not prepared to deal with a crowd. Our room was not cleaned, ever. I had to call for clean towels. We used the hot tub, which wasn't hot, had weak bubbles and had tile missing. We ordered a movie and although the screen said we would be charged 14.99+tax, we were charged 17.99+tax. A complete ripoff!"
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,3,Ok,Ok experience nothing special except when the power went out in the morning and stayed out for a few minutes.
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,Comfortable Beds,"The hotel beds were very comfortable, I slept like a baby."
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,1,traumatic stay,My family decided to stay here the night after spending the day at Virginia beach before heading home. The hotel seemed ok and clean and all was well until about 1am. A couple arrived in the room next to ours and were fighting. It got so loud I had to call the front desk and while I was doing this the women was screaming that she was being beat. There was a lot of banging around and the manager along with someone else came up right away. They proceeded to call the police but when they got there the man had already left. This was a very traumatic experience for my wife and kids and management did not even try to talk to us about it. This was not an experience I would expect from a Hilton hotel. I know some things can't be controlled but management should have followed up on this. Based on this experience I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,Nice Stay,The hotel was decent and affordable. The info for restaurants in the area was very helpful. We went to a local spot which was more pleasant and less crowded. Very close to the intersate.
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,4,friendly helpful staff,"Friendly helpful staff with the exception of breakfast staff. Beds are comfortable and room was clean. Dissapointed the hot tub was broken and the pool was freezing cold. Not a bad stay,but not up to a Hilton property standard."
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,4,convience and pleaseant stay,Was running a 1/2 marathon the next day was looking for a quality room for 4 ( wife child and sister) close to the start Hampton colisieum which the motel met liked the 12 pm check out the room was clean and the personel at the motel were very freindly would stay again
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,Outstanding for the price.,5 star service and amenities at a 3 star price!
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,Good stay,"Had a great stay, however no real complaints. I'm very picky with where I stay. The staff was beyond friendly, the hotel was well kept. They even had snacks when you enter and leave the hotel at the front door. Was very pleased. The only small issue was that the carpet in the room needed shampooing. I normally bring my slippers and forgot this time. Carpet had hair on floor needs better vacuuming and shampoo the walls in the room need touch up paint. It would literally take 20 min for when a quest leaves for walls to be touched up every so often. That was my only issue looking at a dirty wall. However I would stay again. Why are the racks for the towels inside the shower on the wall. Bad idea makes them get damp when you shower."
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,February vacation with family,It was wonderful.
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,excellent,"Great stay, courteous staff, noon check out......perfect after a very long drive!"
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,3,Several Basic Service Flaws in My Stay,"- No ironing board in room at check-in - Maid turned off my room refrigerator for no reason -- stuff inside got warm - No way to set time manually on alarm clock -- it was a constant 1hr 40min behind - Had to go to front desk to get more toilet paper, as"
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,Convenient location great price,Will always stay here when we're in that area
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,Great hotel and reasonably priced,This is a great hotel. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and courteous. Checking in and checking out was very simple without any wait time. The hotel room was spotless along with the lobby and other facilities. I highly recommend staying here.
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,5,Great Hotel and Staff!,"We really enjoyed our overnight visit at the Hilton Garden. The staff was very attentive and my daughter and I felt like we were home. My only disappointment was that we had to pay for breakfast. It wasn't that great, and I felt that it should have been included."
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,2,The housekeeping staff is very dishonest...,Never make a mistake and leave anything behind. The housekeeping staff will claim to not have seen it. There is no point of having a lost and found and this hotel....very disappointing for a Hilton
Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Coliseum Central,4,Hilton Garden Inn Hampton Colliseum,"Great hotel, excellent service from staff including front desk and the restaurant. Breakfast was a fair price and had many options. Food was excellent. Wait staff paid excellent attention to customers. Knew what they wanted for refills and such. And as I'm diabetic, I loved that they had sugar free stuff available. That impressed me a lot. What also impressed me a lot was the option of fruit as a substitute for fries with dinner. Never had that before. Front desk staff were very attentive and helpful. It was near enough to the colliseum, but the hotel and the colliseum are in a kinda tricky area to get in and out of. Nice area, just tricky to navigate. Would recommend to others and would definitely come back again. Rooms were comfy and beds were comfy too. Only complaint with room was very noisy air conditioner or fan or something in the room. All in all great hotel for a great price."
Hampton Inn Newark-Airport,5,Very nice stay!,"Overall great stay, staf is very nice and helpful! Shuttle bus on time and 24/7 so very convienient. Also the breakfast at 6 and if you need to go before that, they give you a breakfast baggie to go, very thoughtful! Close to the airport and to Jersey Gardens Mall! I would recommend this hotel and come back here for sure."
Hampton Inn Newark-Airport,4,Good hotel for a one night stay,Good hotel for a one night stay
Hampton Inn Newark-Airport,3,good for an overnight stay prior to a flight,Stop over prior to a trip to Orlando. Convenient. Airport shuttle big plus
Hampton Inn Newark-Airport,2,Poor Quality,This hotel is not up to my standards. The heating/cooling system was extremely loud and woke me up several times during the night. The hotel reception desk clerk was not helpful at all. The quality of food items for the breakfast buffet were very limited and not very good.
Hampton Inn Newark-Airport,4,Best of the EWR area hotels. Would stay again!,"WiFi turns off each 15 min requiring new log in. 2 broadcast channels didn't work, some cable channels scratchy, but HBO and NBC were loud and clear along with all the ESPN and FOX channels. Bed was nice, could have used some firmer pillows. Super friendly and polite staff that stands out. FREE car parking for guests! Local area, well it's a NYC area airport hotel. Still I'd rather use EWR over the others for accessibility. Enough said."
Hampton Inn Newark-Airport,3,Moderate Hotel,"room was fine except carpet felt sticky, I kept my shoes on the whole time."
Hampton Inn Newark-Airport,3,noisy at night!,"very noisy at night, from people walking around and talking in the hallway. not recommend."

Best Western Cordelia Inn,5,Excellent customer service,My daughter and I stayed overnight here before her cosmetology state board test.

Courtyard Myrtle Beach Barefoot Landing,5,Great Hotel!,"We were blown away at the dcor and style of this Courtyard Marriott! We were finishing our vacation week which was split between Myrtle and Charleston SC and we had just been very disappointed by our stay in Charleston at the Hyatt Place. This was just what we needed to turn things around! We were going to a show at the House of Blues and it was perfect, just down the street! Plenty of gas, mini golf, food, bars, shopping etc nearby! We arrived early and they did not have rooms ready so they gave us free waters and snacks and although we maybe waited 30 mins for a room they kept checking on us as well as still got us into a room before the posted check in time on 4th of July weekend! I would highly recommend this hotel!!"
Courtyard Myrtle Beach Barefoot Landing,4,Good stay,No complaints

Courtyard Myrtle Beach Barefoot Landing,5,House of Blues Concert Stay,The hotel staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. The beds were comfortable and sheets were clean. Check-in was a breeze.
Courtyard Myrtle Beach Barefoot Landing,4,Great,Nice
Courtyard Myrtle Beach Barefoot Landing,4,Great Location,I have stayed at this hotel several times. The location is great and the staff is friendly. The hot water was only warm which made the stay less than stellar.
Courtyard Myrtle Beach Barefoot Landing,5,Great Anniversary,We originally was staying at Super 8. But that hotel was very disgusting. So we stayed at Courtyard by Marriott. Very clean friendly. Will surely stay again highly recommend it to family friends.
"The Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain",4,"If you like isolation, this is it","The hotel staff is fantastic. From the front desk to the pools to restaurants, everyone is pleasant, helpful and anxious to be of service. Biggest downside would be the location. It's 30-40 minutes from the nearest good restaurants and after 3 days the in-house restaurants get kind of old. It's a far cheaper option than Four Seasons Scottsdale and offers... More"
"The Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain",5,Very Accommodating,The property was very nice and very clean. The rooms are a nice size and are very clean. The food at all the restaurants was very good and the prices are what you expect to pay at a five star resort and not over inflated. The best part though is the staff. Every interaction we had with any staff member... More
"The Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain",5,Wonderful trip,My wife and I stayed at the Ritz Carlton for three nights while attending a wedding held at the resort. The wedding was beautiful and the staff and scenery was top notch. We attended the wedding during a busy time in our lives and yet we were totally relaxed upon entering the property!
"The Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain",4,Vacation,"My Wife and I stayed here for 3 nights . The Staff were very helpful and friendly , quickly acknowledging us by name . We stayed in a casita which was spacious and well equipped , although the air conditioning was very noisy . The pool area was very good , providing two areas with one clearly meant for Families...

"The Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain",5,Wow!,"Friends had told us that this resort was worth visiting, so we booked a five day visit in early March, 2016 and weren't disappointed.

Three restaurants to choose from at hotel (plus to go service if want a snack or light breakfast) and one... More"
"The Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain",5,Fabulous resort,"How to describe perfection Total elegance, super-attentive staff, adjacent to hiking trails from the hotel property, early morning/late night hot pooling, astronomic observation from the green, resident desert tortoises, on-site rangers, delicious drinks, sushi, golf (if that's your thing) and every amenity you can think of.

"The Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain",5,The Best Resort You Haven't Heard About,I have no idea why this resort isn't on more people's radar. Maybe it's better that it isn't - but now you know the secret. It's located just far away from town that it feels secluded but not remote. The building is well laid out and nothing seems like it is too far. The property is perfectly maintained and appropriately... More
"The Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain",5,Great service and views,"We were absolutely treated as you would expect...very high end experience with all the right amenities. Golf course is very challenging and cheap if you play in the summer (too hot for most, but get a cart and bring water and it's totally worth it). The rooms were exceptional (amazing views from this slightly perched location) and the service was... More"
"The Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain",5,Beauty that Blends,Build into to mouth of a desert canyon the hotel is structured and colored to fit in with the landscape. The two pools are wonderful as are the hiking trails and golf course. The food and cocktails are also excellent but the wine list could use some work. My favorite rooms are in the separate casitas -- more expensive but... More
"The Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain",5,Wonderful Place,"We stayed here two nights and boy I wish it was more. Great fun for my kids 10,12. The service is fantastic!

"The Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain",5,Amazing! Best hotel experience ever,"The service is outstanding. Every staff member regardless of their position went out of their way to be helpful and accommodating - and always with a smile.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Graduation/family vacation in the Capitol,"Great access to transportation, major tourist attractions, and restaurants. Nearby mall is an added bonus."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,"Beautiful hotel, so why ruin that","Embassy Suites are always beautiful, open spaces and comfortable rooms. This one, across the river from the National Mall, didn't disappoint in it's appearance and cleanliness. But I'm confused why the room service policy doesn't include timely pick-up of used dishes. We saw numerous trays of dirty dinner dishes on the hallway floors 12 to 15 hours after delivery. Seems it would be much cleaner and less (potential) bug-attracting to collect those dishes early in the morning, before breakfast is served. This issue seemed tacky to me, its the kind of thing guests shouldn't have an opportunity to observe. Instead, guests can't help but walk past lots of dirty dishes on their way to breakfast. Equally, dining room staff needs to be sufficient to keep the tables clean at the same rate of guest arriving for breakfast...or at least give us a place near the kitchen to bus our own trays! I saw lots of folks trying to find a clean table, while lots of other folks were trying to clean up after themselves. Aside from this issue, the staff bent over backwards for every question, request or incident."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Very nice,"Very nice, very reasonable, very clean. Nice friendly staff"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Embassy Suites is Awesome!,Excellent.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,"Nice, clean and comfortable!","Great, night sleep on nice, clean King size bed. Nice comfortable pillows! Room was large and very clean. Front desk staff was friendly. Free shuttle to/from National airport and to/from a nearby Metro station and complimentary, fresh breakfast buffet is a nice plus! Highly recommend this hotel."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,"Very convenient location, helpful services","We enjoyed the hotel very much, particularly the free shuttle to/from the airport and metro station and to drop us at a restaurant for dinner. The complimentary afternoon reception and complete breakfast were excellent and enhanced an at-home atmosphere. The rooms were clean and roomy. We would stay here again."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,great family hotel,Great location. Excellent service. Delicious breakfast. Extremely accomodating for late checkout.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Nice hotel - close to attractions in D.C.,"I thought the hotel was very nice. The staff was wonderful! They were very helpful and friendly. Only thing I did not like was the hotel allowed smoking out in front of the main entrance. It is fine with me if people choose to smoke, but when you are waiting for a shuttle and have about 6 or more people standing around you smoking it is a little uncomfortable for those who do not smoke. The only other thing that I did not like was one day when we were on the shuttle there was a young women already on when we got on. I am not sure if she was an employee of the hotel but it was clear she was not a hotel guest. I do not know your rules on people riding your shuttle but here is what the problem was this women took up 2 seats - the shuttle was full and people, guest of the hotel, had to stand. If she was not a guest of the hotel (which from her conversation with the driver I am guessing she was not) the drive should of had her stand so that people who paid to stay at the hotel could be seated. If she was an employee of the hotel she needed to move over to allow a guest to sit with her and not take up two seats. That was a little disappointing but that being said the shuttle service was great. Right on time every day you have to love that! It was my son's first time to D.C. thank you for making it a great trip."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Buen servicio,Buen servicio
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Very clean and Comfortable,"Very clean, very modern Shower curtain should have been changed, it was vile, but within 10 minutes, it was changed and the staff were apologetic. Our room had a view of the freeway which we liked. The man checking me in was LOUD! like everyone in the lobby knew what room I was in, my name and my address because he was just loud, but I only spoke to him the one time so that was good. Complimentary drink coupons at check-in for happy hour at the bar were a nice touch. Very comfy bed an super squishy pillows. Very happy with the visit."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Walk to metro. Very convenient,"We enjoyed our stay except there were a couple of family reunions going on and the hotel was very full. We were on the third floor and could hear people taking outside all night. Called the desk 2 days in a row and they said they would take care of it, but did not. 2 bad nights of sleep."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Nice and comfortable,"It was a wonderful experience.the room is nice, clean and spacious. The location is accessible to shoppers and they have a hotel service to the airport."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,nice place/close to DCA airport.,great stay....pool hours are lousy!!!
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Great stay,"This hotel is very nice. Comfortable bed, lots of room, great Breakfast. The only cheesy thing was their evening snack at happy hour. It was potato chips and cheese with a variety of dry snacks. They may as well have put out pretzels and nuts and called it a day. I expected more."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Broken Air Conditioner,"I havw stayed at this hotel several times and the staff is pleasant and the rooms are clean. However, every time I stay there is usually a proble with the air conditioner or the heater. Each time maintenance has to fix it. I don't understand why the first nigjt I have to sleep sweating or cold because the air or heat is not working properly. I think the hotel must control the utilities from a central unit and they do not adjust the temperature for you until you complain. Otherwise, the hotel is lovely. Expect to pay a whopping 32 per night for parking. Unbelievable!"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,The Mall,I loved it but i think the parking is to high.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Nice family vacation property if visiting DC,"Great location in Crystal City - near the Airport and Metro. No car necessary to see DC. Hotel is comfortable for families and quite affordable compared to others, especially if you need more than one room with kids. Breakfast buffet is convenient and nightly reception is nice as well. The pool is small but adequate. Staff was very friendly and accommodating."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Clean Comfortable,"The hotel was up to date very clean. The room was roomy comfortable enough for us to entertain family. Breakfast was wonderful! They had made to order omelets, bacon, fruit, etc which is free. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that someone was smoking marijuana on out floor children were running wild! Otherwise a good experience I would stay again!"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Friendly Staff,The hotel staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. The hallways were somewhat dirty(rugs not vacuumed on a regular basis)The food was okay which is fine since we ate out alot. I would definitely stay again.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Great stay. Access to DC and sites is easy,"Would recommend overall. We were there in January and the weather was very cold. We expected outside to be cold. The hotel's entrance doors were open a lot, tho, and that made the restaurant and seating ,common areas too cold to enjoy. Happy hour cold, breakfast cold Poor concierge employees very cold. Other times of the year would be better...OR rotational doors, Rooms was great and comfort in the room spot on"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Loved it - for the second time!,"Beautiful hotel, very convenient to the metro in Crystal City. Wonderful complimentary breakfast. Enjoyed manager's reception nightly. Will stay here again - this was our second visit in 5 years to the same hotel. Spacious suites. Nice large flat panel televisions - 2 per suite. Workout room adequate. We had a dead battery in the hotel garage and the guest services attendant helped us find a car service employee who assisted us for no charge! Only suggestion - bathrooms need exhaust fans! I believe they are scheduled to be remodeled soon..."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Good Value - Decent Place,"Good workout facility, eliptical machines and treadmills with TV's, abs machine and free weights. Nice room. Few blocks from the Metro and a shuttle runs to the Pentagon City station and Reagan Airport. Usual good Embassy breakfast, friendly competent staff."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,"Fab hotel, well located",Brilliant hotel and very helpful staff
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,"Close to shopping, Metro, and D.C.","Room was great, staff was professional and helpful, and breakfast was delicious."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Outstanding Family Hotel,"All of the usual accolades to a good hotel apply here. But I was particularly impressed by the employees' response when my 15-year-old granddaughter decided to socialize with some boys she met at the pool and didn't bother to tell me where she was going. The hotel's front desk and security people were extremely efficient and courteous in locating her, saving her 70-year-old grandfather much angst! And the service people in the restaurant area also went out of their way to get to know us."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,great stay,the rooms were spacious and had fridge with microwave the beds were very comfortable amenties were great breakfast was awesone and yvonne at front desk was awesone
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Great Hotel For Vacationing,This is an older Embassy Suites that has been very well maintined and updated. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We were there for 6 days and they did everything to make sure our stay was pleasurable. The restaurant is a great place to eat if you are too tired to venture out for dinner. The front desk has a great local restaurant list and the hotel van will drop you off and pick you up when you are finished eating. We loved the daily breakfast buffet and the evening manager's reception. The hotel is located about a block from the metro station. We enjoyed the daily walk to the station and found it very easy to get to all the sites we were they to see via the metro.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Great Stay for the Price,"This was one of the cheaper rates in the area. (This of course is a relative term in the DC area) I was surprised to find a great, spacious suite with great service. The price included a hot breakfast buffet. I'm looking forward to going back. Chuck"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,3,Would stay again if,The hotel was clean but the service personnel leave much to be desired. They were not as helpful as you would expect. They could anser simple questions and some even had attitudes.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Can't wait to go back.,"superb hotel. Can't go wrong with location, comfort or worth the money you spend for it. With breakfast buffet and afternoon reception you can't go wrong with meeting everyones wants. the rooms are comfortable and quiet. We were by the elevator and couldn't not here the elevator and traffic coming or going. Free transportation to local restuarants, metro and airport was just another bonus. All hotel personnel were top notch ..very friendly, helpful and efficient. Couldn't be happier with our trip and accommodations."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,3,disappointed,"Having stayed at several Embassy Suites, this one in Crystal City does not meet the expectation of Embassy Suite standards. The hotel's only restaurant does not have much to offer as compared to the 3 restaurants of Marriott Hotel which is next door. The front desk people needs further training in Customer Service. Granted that they may be college students, their customer service needs to focus on the needs of the Customer such as inquiring if there are any questions we may have regarding the town i.e, restaurants, shopping, metro transit. The only thing that is great w/ this place is their full breakfast."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Very nice facility,I enjoyed the convenience of the location and having the Whole Foods store within walking distance was a plus.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,family vacation,"We enjoy the stay, we can visit all museums but for next time"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Next time also I will stay in your hotel.,"My only one complaint is that you have not mentioned your phone number in the web site( when I took the print out after booking, there is no phone number on the sheet). I was not aware that your shuttle service will not pick from Crystal city metro station, so I waited for your vehicle for about 20mins, and then I got help from Rennainace hotel's shuttle.Thank you"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,nice stay,"Staff was friendly and place was clean and very nice. Only issues that we had was the windows were a bit drafty, not sealing very well and most of the TV channels went out in the evening and didn't come back up until the time we left. I inquired several times at the front desk and they said they were working on it. I understand the weather was not good and may have affected it but not for as long as it was. Other than that, the stay was really really nice and comfortable."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,3,not worth the,"With all the other choices in the area, I'll stay somewhere else next time. This is the 1st Embasy Suites I won't stay at again. It doesn't appear that they care about the upkeep of the hotel and as a non-smoker, I wasn't impressed with the smoke everywhere! I DID receive the non-smoking room I reserved...Too bad it wasn't smoke-free...because the room REEKED!!"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,2,Hotel under construction with terrible staff,"Hotel was under construction and smelled bad and was very messy. On top of that the staff was bad. We were in a rush and needed a cab to get to an event. We told the man at the desk to call a cab when we checked in. When we came down later he hadn't gotten a cab for us, so we asked him to call the cab again. After sitting in the lobby for 15 minutes waiting, we asked when our cab was coming and he said he didnt know we still wanted a cab and would call. Eventually 25 minutes later a cab dropped someone off at the hotel and we were able to take that cab."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Embassy Suites Crystal City - National Airport,An excellent value given the area. Very courteous and professional staff. We were astounded by the continental breakfast: complete w/chef! :) We enjoyed the since of security with the hotel's parking garage. Let's not forget the free drinks. ) A+++ would definitely stay again.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Excellent choice!,"This is a low-price hotel with very high quality. I was impressed with how fancy it was for such a great bargain. The breakfast is delicious. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. Also, the staff is as nice as can be. I enjoyed my stay very much and decide to stay there everytime I visit Washington DC."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Great stay,"nice room, located 4 blocks from Pentagon City Mall"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Great Choice!,Loved the breakfast!!
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Close to Pentagon and Metro but pricey,"The Embassy Suites Crystal City is a nice hotel, the closest one to the Pentagon. They will drive you to the Pentagon in their shuttle but you have to walk across the whole parking lot to get to the entrance. If it is raining or snowing that might be a uncomfortable walk. The walk to the Metro is the longest in Crystal City but still not too bad, about 5 blocks. Their shuttle is great, they will drop you off to restaurants or the metro, but you might have to wait a bit to get a ride. My only issue are they do not have enough smoking rooms - they always say they are full and they have plenty of rooms and floors to add smoking rooms and it is pricy - but that is to be expected in DC."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Close to Metro,This hotel is convenient to Metro with large comfortable rooms and free breakfast.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,3,Bad with the good,Toliet overflowed. Rug remained wet. Carpet wet and smelled moldy in my daughters room. Water in drinking fountain cloudy. Breakfast buffet excellent. Staff friendly and helpful except when the toilet water was running everywhere. Free shuttle to the airport and metro very convenient.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Excellent hotel and convinient,"I stayed for 3 nights with my family. We enjoyed it. It is in a good location, actually not far from both crystal city and Pentogan city stations. However, we need to walk about 200 m to get to metro station of crystal city. This is a fine distance to walk. It is very quite and clean. Breakfast is excellent. The resturant also provide good grills. The stay is almost half or less than half price of Embassy suite in downtown, but it is only 15 min by metro from downtwon, and 1 stop by metro from the airport. It is an absolute great chioce to stay there."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,2,great holiday,"Pluses: location, all suites Minuses: Rude and unhelpful staff, worst breakfast selection and coffee quality of any Embassy Suites I've ever stayed in"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Great place to stay if visiting D.C.,"Excellent experience. The only issue I had was the small omelet that was served at breakfast. Other than that, it was a great stay !"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,3,Standard big corporate hotel experience,"It's a standard Embassy Suites, just super overpriced. Staff is friendly. Saw a roach at breakfast. And overall, breakfast is pretty basic/tasteless. Good location - shuttles to reagan and pentagon city metro. No shuttles to IAD. Considering there are so many other similarly priced places in the area - no loyalty to return here. Not a very distinguishing experience either way - Standard big corporate hotel experience."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,"Spacious rooms, great location at a reasonable pri","Very nice suite, clean and neat as a pin, in a great location. Parking is in a gated garage (cost is extra)."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,3,18 per day parking fee is NOT disclosed,"There is an 18 per day charge for parking (very well secured) which is not disclosed in the expedia information. Other than that, the hotel was pretty nice. Rooms are currently undergoing refurb, our room had the brand new carpet smell which was quite overwhelming. The staff was nice courteous. The breakfast buffet was not up to ES standards compared to others. Hotel was very clean. Oh, and the elevator, you have to take one up from the garage then another up to the rooms and elevator service was slow, small often cramped with people or guests with luggage."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,DC,Excellent
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Good / convenient hotel,Spent 9 days at Embassy Suites while visiting family and sight-seeing. Short walk to Metro and access to all areas of DC made sight-seeing easy. Appreciated the full breakfast every morning and evening happy hour at end of day. Bed was comfortable room was clean and quiet small kitchenette was useful. Hotel shuttle to area restaurants also appreciated.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,michelle review,It's was very comfortable and clean no problem
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Great stay!,Great hotel.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,"Great for kids, Friendly staff","I thought the staff were very friendly, with an exception to one of the female pool staff. Perfect place for the kids though. We had an incident were our youngest got sick in the car, the front desk went out of their way to help, and within minutes helped me make an appointment for cleaning. They also recommended touring, although the touring company turned out to be a disaster! The downed elevator was a bit annoying. We read in a review that there was a cockroach in one of the rooms, and it was too bad that we also saw a quarter sized one in the breakfast area! We quickly told the kids it was a beetle. When I told the front desk about it, they were very apologetic and credited our parking."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Centrally located,"The hotel was very clean, staff was amazing and very helpful. I would definitely recommend this to a family or friend. Yes, if I'm in the area I would love to stay here again. Great facility"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Convenient for DCA and short stay,"I stayed over cuz I had a work event on the same night as the Cubs being in the World Series and didn't want to drive back home. Worked for what I needed but word of the wise it's closer to Alexandria vs DC proper so plan accordingly. But staff was very helpful. I booked very last minute on hotels.com for a king bed but got two doubles which was a bit frustrating as I was a solo person but getting back from watching the game at 2am, I didn't really care enough to call down (I had only dropped my bags off in the room upon checking in and immediately walked out of the room)."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Great location,"This hotel was great. The staff was genuinely nice and helpful. My boyfriend and I came for a trip to the Verizon Center to catch a Wizards game. The Verizon Center was not far at all. I called front desk for a cab and had one in about 5 minutes. The room was clean and nice. I'm a bit of a germaphobic and I had no problem with it. I didn't spot one dirty spot or anything. When we first got in the room there was a problem with the heat. Maintenance came and fixed it quickly and all was well. If I had to list one improvement it would be that the furniture looks a little outdated. But it was not really a problem. It didn't look dirty or run down, just not fashionable. Other than that, this hotel was wonderful. It was in a great location to restaurants and DC and I would absolutely stay here again."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Close to all.,Very good service and accommodation.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,"Pricey, but many extras","Good location for National Airport, but very pricey. Hotel very nicely maintained. A bit of road noise.The 'Manager's Reception' features plenty of drinks, and some food, but not really dinner. Good exercise room. Breakfasts are excellent, but start at 6 so not good for very early flights. Watch out for all the kids. The place was overrun with them when I was there."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Great hotel close to metro.,"The breakfast buffet was phenomenal! The challenge was getting out of bed and get to breakfast on time!! The bed was very comfortable! Also, the breakfast staff were very hospitable. One of the chef (big guy) was wonderful at making sure we had the food we needed. He was very attentive to all guest needs. I will definitely stay again!"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Great Stay,"I had a wonderful stay at this hotel. From the time I arrived the customer service I received has been nothing less of truly amazing. All the way from the staff that checked me in to the staff at the bar during happy hour. The shuttles are great if you dont have a car they will take you to/from the airport, to/from the mall and anywhere requested within a mile radius of the airport. The room its self can use a bathroom update but overall not too bad. The breakfast was great with cooked to order omelets. This hotel was worth every penny."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Detroit traveler June 2012,Everything was clean and comfortable. The room was larger than any I have seen. The staff was very professional and friendly. I will stay here again when I come back to D.C.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,great service,Excellent service
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,3,Good But Possibility of Being Much Better,I was in town for a seminar that was located at the Embassy Suites at Crystal City.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,3,Location comoda,Le stanze avrebbero bisogno di una ristrutturazione. Location strategica Colazione nella media
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,3,Weekend getaway,"Ventilation system was blowing cigarette smoke into the room, called the front desk and they seemed ambivalent. Room temperature uncontrollable, ended up opening window in snow storm to cool down room."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Pleasant Surprise,"This hotel has a lot to offer at a good value. The suite was spacious for the price. It offered a separate BR from the tv watching area and desk. It had two televisions, a fridge and microwave. The staff were courteous and friendly to a fault. This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. As to the extras - the hotel offered on site parking in their private garage. There was a great complimentary breakfast each morning, offering every conceivable food. Last, there was a 3 hour happy hour that offered free drinks (adult beverages as well!) and snacks - daily! This Embassy Suite was very close to the Monuments, literally an exit away. There were restaurants close, as well. We would, absolutely, stay here again!"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Very well priced and accessible,"Staff was very helpful and responsive. The rooms, pool and parking were not as clean or good as usual embassy suites but in no means bad for the value."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed at this hotel the last week in December the weather was extremely cold, arrived 1 week after the snow storm but the hotel service was very warm. The shuttle service was excellent the would drop pick you up from any area inb their vicinity. Also need to mention that guest from another hotel was waiting in the cold at the mall and the shuttle driver offered to drop them to their hotel which was excellent service. The front desk staff are very helpful. Only downfall, the double room beds are little bigger than twin beds."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Staff went above and beyond to help us...,We took our two grand children to see DC and stayed at the Embassy because of its convenience to the city. Our grandson has extreme food restrictions due to food alergies so we were not sure how this trip would go. It was his first trip away from home. TWe explained to the chef and server that he needed special food preparation and care. They went far and above to make sure his needs were met and to follow up that he was taken care of. Thanks to these good folks we feel more comfortable about travelling with him. The Embassy staff made this a great summer for our grandson.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Loved it!,"I so loved this hotel. The breakfast was great, although it was the same thing daily. I love the separate bedroom with a door. Every minor problem we had, someone was there to correct immediately. We stayed here to attend a convention in DC."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Great place to stay for families,"We were able to check in at 10 AM. This early check in was great for us. We had sometime to get rest after long drive and could park our car and took off to the museums by subway which was about 10 minutes walk with the kids. Also, they serve us breakfast and some drinks at dinner time."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,3,Assez proche d'attractions touristiques.,"L'accueil chalereux meme s'il faisat tres froid dehors c'est pourquoi le 3 janvier etait assez froid dans l'espace ou on prenait le breakfast...l'autre jour beaucoup mieux. La chambre assez propre, le climatiseur un peu bruyant...mais c'etait correct...."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,I would stay again.,"I had a great stay. It was easy access to the interstate, as well as easy access into downtown DC. I must say I was disappointed with having to pay for parking. Overall breakfast was good, but on two different days I had to contact the concierge about sour dairy products. The problem was fixed, but it made me leary. Well rested nights. This is good deal."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Great for a family visit!,"When all hotels in DC are over 250 during the week of the National Prayer Breakfast, it's so nice to have an affordable hotel near the Metro with complimentary breakfasts and DCA shuttles. Will definitely stay here again."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Good location great service,"Enjoyed cleanliness of room, quality of service and location near Metro and Fashion Center."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,4,Family and Friend Trip,"Very enjoyable. The breakfast was excellent, just get down early. The hotel is within walking distance to the metro and the nightly shuttle offers service to the shops. It was great."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,"Warm,friendly service Clean rooms Great Food!","My friend and I selected this hotel for the extra room provided--a nice living room area that included a great flat-screen TV, small frig, microwave and sink. An ironing board and iron provided the ability to have our clothes look freshly pressed each day, the bathroom was beautiful and clean and the bed was very comfortable! (Great TV in the bedroom also). The made to order breakfast each day was of good quality and service was warm and friendly the evening drinks and snacks were great also. Maid service kept our room spotless! There isn't anything I could recommend that would have added to our hotel experience--I will definitely look for an Embassy Suites everywhere I go!"
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Nice Hotel,"Very nice, clean hotel. The staff was very friendly. However, the room was very warm and even though I adjusted the thermostat it was still too warm. The windows will open a couple of inches which helped. It was 17 degrees outside and 85 inside. So, it didn't take too long to cool the room temperature down. The breakfast was good. They actually have real eggs and you can get them cooked to order."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Bestfriends get away,I had a great stay. Staff was very friendly and welcoming.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Great location but extra costs,"Clean, comfortable, good breakfast but parking and internet fee are extra which you have to consider. I decided not to use wifi and used from cell phone data plan. Other than that, everything was good."
Embassy Suites by Hilton Crystal City National Airport,5,Getaway weekend,I had an amazing time. The hotel is close to all the tourist spots. The hotel has free shuttle service to and from the hotel and to the metro station. The bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to get out of bed. The free breakfast was amazing!
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,4.5,My stay was wonderful. The only thing I would adjust is the room temperature. I was not very cold.
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Nice Stay,"Friendly staff, very helpful, clean rooms. Metro across the street (Blue line 2 stops to Arlington, Yellow line 3 stops to monuments/museums). Nice if you want to stay outside the main sightseeing area. Would stay again."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Willing to stay here again,"restaurant and room service food was quite good. was planning to go to some of the better restarants in town as we usualy try to do on vacation, but ended up eating in the hotel multiple times and not missing going out."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,outstanding 5 star hotel,"Enjoyed every minute of our stay. Everything is convenient, the food, shopping, and sight seeing activities, I.e.,museums."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",4,DC weekend,My fiance and I stayed here to go the Nationals games Friday and Saturday nights. The hotel is very close to the metro and made it easy to get to the ballpark and the zoo. The free champagne was a nice touch to start our trip. Only negative is that if you use the wifi and are not a Rita Carlton rewards member they charge you 9.95 per day. I asked about this charge and they promptly refunded it since we were only using it to check emails on our phones and could have used our data had we known it was that expensive. Otherwise a very nice hotel with excellent staff that make your experience enjoyable.
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Terrific Location marvelous staff,"We arrived at the hotel a few days after a devastating thunderstorm had knocked out power to a large portion of DC, MD, VA. The hotel had opened up to refugees that had no power so they did not have a room with 2 double beds as we had ordered. They gave us a room with a king bed and a rollaway bed. It was cramped for 4 of us. But the hotel staff was indeed marvelous and went out of their way to make our stay at DC a very good experience. Excellent location with metro and a great shopping mall on site. Lots of fabulous restaurants within a short walk. My kids loved the hotel and their indoor pool. We will stay there again the next time we visit DC."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Hard to top.,"What one would expect for an RC property. The restaurant was excellent and the room was spacious and comfortable. It is near many restaurants and the Metro station is right in front for an affordable commute into D.C. All things considered, a great pick for you stay in the D.C. area."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Luxury!,"The room is nice, luxury hotel, nice breakfast. Good location!"
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Nice hotel close to a mall and Costco,"We enjoyed it very much because it is close to subways and to the airport,the attractions."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Pleasure!,"The stay was a good little get away for me and my wife, and to take care of some business."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,My Best Hotel Experience Ever,"Since I rarely have or take the time to reply to emails asking me to rate a particular hotel, item or service me seeking out your website to make my comments is telling in itself. My wife and I stayed in the Pentagon City location from 7/4/2013 to 7/7/2013. It was, in our opinion, the best hotel stay for us, ever. Every single member of the staff that we encountered from the moment that we pulled our vehicle into the check in area on 7/4 until our trunk was packed on 7/7 was friendly, professional and helpful. It was our pleasure to enjoy dinner in your restaurant on 7/4 and breakfast the remaining three days. Each meal was excellent. I would specifically like to mention Bryan Haley who took the time on the evening of 7/4 to chat with us at our dinner table. What is amazing to me is that Bryan and most of the other staff seemed to remember us and all of the other guests. Please thank your staff for a memorable stay. I would hope to stay at your hotel the next time we have the opportunity to be in the Washington, D.C. Area."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",3,Wonderful staff and great access to metro rail,"We had a great stay at the Ritz in Pentagon City however it was not without a few faults. First on our first night we attempted to order room service which was supposed to be available 24/7 however after letting the phone ring for over five minutes without any one answering.... Twice we tried calling the concierge and got the same lack of response so we gave up and went to bed hungry. The other issue was with the shower. The water pressure from the bath tub faucet was fine and the water was hot but on e you switched it to shower there was so little flow that it would take forever to rinse shampoo out of your hair. I eventually resorted to switching back to the bathtub faucet and used one of the glasses to rinse my hair filing it from the bathtub faucet. The next night I decided I would just take a bath instead of standing in the sprinkle of the shower however the bathtub stopper would not deal off enough to even get more than 1 inch of water in the tub. To get by I used that came glass to cover the drain and it worked well enough after I wrapped a wash cloth around the base to help seal it off. I know these seem like small first world problems, but when you are staying at the Ritz there is a certain expectation of quality"
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,perfect location,first class experience! on the metro line! shopping next door!!! awesome sunday brunch !!!!
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,great place,The service was the best by far friendly speedy made us feel at home
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Best Ritz for the Price,We had a great stay at the Ritz and would definitely stay there again. Everything was as you would expect.
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Great family stay,"In DC at the beginning of the Labor Day weekend, and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay. The service was fantastic from the moment we arrived by taxi, through check-in, and culminating in a turn-down service that was just the extra special treatment we loved. There were special weekend events like a family movie with tons of snacks, wine and cheese tasting in the lobby, even a magician for the kids. I loved it. The kids loved it. I would recommend highly and definitely stay again when in the DC area. The metro is right outside the front door!"
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Great location and value,"The service at the hotel was very good, friendly staff especially the valets. The only downside to our stay was the extremely hot temperature in the room, thermostat did nothing to improve the situation. We only stayed one night so we dealt with it."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,The best hotel I have experienced.,"Arrived by subway, tired and worn. Met Frank at check-in. Took care of everything. Could not have been more helpful. Pointed out possibilities for dining after arrival, offered tips for maneuvering the subway. Frank stood out among all the VERY helpful and friendly staff. See you guys next year!"
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",4,great service,"Service is great, Charles is awesome, he goes above and beyond to take care of us. Everyone, actually, was very friendly and very helpful. The only two things we didn't like was the room had a horrible view, and the pillows were so soft that they didn't provide any support, and that made sleep not very comfortable."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Wonderful experience,Customer service was exceptional
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",4,Access to the Metro was ideal.,"The bathroom was too cramped the room just average. The menus were overpriced and unremarkable. The staff was courteous and responsive to requests. The fitness facility was adequate however, the lap pool is too short and too hot. The locker rooms were exceptional. The access to the Fashion Centre was an unexpected treat."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Why stay anywhere else,"Fantastic - ease of travel convenience, location with respect to attending events (easy access to Metro), great bar at the hotel. I cannot think of a single negative and will stay there anytime I travel to D.C."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,perfect!,"We were there for only two nights, but we were extremely pleased. The meeting halls for our conference were great, our room was wonderfully comfortable, clean, and well-furnished, and most importantly the hospitality and courtesy shown to us as guests tops that of any other hotel we've ever stayed at. This hotel is right at a metro station for two lines that go straight into the downtown area, and is only 3 minutes from the airport. It's also connected to a wonderful mall. In all, the only word to describe the experience is, well, perfect!"
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Great Deal,Great facility and top-notch service at half the price of the comparable hotels across the Potomac. Easy access to DC via the Metro stop beneath the hotel.
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",4,Good weekend family spot close to metro and mall,"Great hotel across street from metro, nice pool and sauna. Great ritz service."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Wonderful hotel close to important sights.,"We loved this hotel! The staff was super friendly and accommodating. The food in the restaurant was delicious, and our grandchildren were given special attention and treats. Rooms were lovely and very comfortable."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Service was amazing from the time we walked in,"From the time we walked in and greeted by Frank we knew it was going to be an amazing place. Frank gave us some local tips and Ed escorted us to our beautiful room making sure we had everything we needed, bringing us extra water and suggesting places to eat. We were there for 2 amazing nights, shame we didn't take as much advantage as we could have being.located in the shopping plaza..... So so many shops. Courteous, friendly staff. Service impeccable, in fact we rushed in after a full day had a quick shower before meeting friends, returned and found fresh towels! Amazing"
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Ritz Carlton - Pentagon CIty,"This hotel certainly keeps with the Ritz Carlton name. Great surroundings. great service, and great food all made for a relaxing stay."
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Perfect Ritz,Newly renovated. Great room. and facilities. Attached to Pentagon Mall. Great shopping and restaurants. 8 minutes to Reagan National
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Friendly and professional.,The hotel staff are very friendly and professional. They went out of their way to ensure that my comfort was their priority. Everything I requested was brought to me in a timely manner. They also gave me my privacy when I needed it.
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Excellent staff and hotel.,We had an amazing experience. The hotel was very close to everything and every single employee had excellent customer service. Will definitely go back.
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Great place,"Wonderful as always, the consistent level of quality is always reassuring and so pleasant"
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Our Seach Has Ended!,"Ever time we travel to D.C., one of our kids' favorite destinations, we struggle to find the right place in the right area. We either find a nice place that is almost a mile from the Metro stop or we find a crappy place within steps of a stop. The Ritz was on-point. From the ambience, to the staff, the quality of food, cleanliness of the rooms, down to the way they treated our children we loved it! The cherry on the ice cream is the Ritz is litterally 100 ft from the Metro. We will never search for a hotel again!"
"The Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City",5,Great location,"Great location for a Fourth of July weekend! Wonderful staff, comfortable room woulddefinitely stay here again!"
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,Good value for price,"Hotel was fine and met needs. Nice amenities in king size room. Room was also a good value for price. Room had nice amenities except it lacked any blankets on bed or available in room. Bed only had a sheet (no comforter or blanket). Many people prefer to keep room cool, but have a blanket to keep warm while sleeping. Excellent breakfast."
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Budget hotel done well.,"Hotel staff unusually pleasant and accommodating. Night club loud and hopping, but could not hear a thing from my 4th floor room. Could hear the nearby interstate, though. Motorcycles. Toiletries did not include conditioner and none available in gift shop. Convenience store near by, but borrowed some from a fellow guest we met at the free breakfast. Breakfast was good. Very convenient to highway."
Best Western Capital Beltway,5,Great hotel for the price.,"Staff was very friendly. Lifeguard went out of his way for us as did all of the staff. My kids loved the little gift shop. Food was good with egg burritos, pancakes, sausage and lots more. Housekeeping did a great job with our room despite our kid's mess. Hotel has some older architecture that was very charming. Overall, great experience."
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,close to Metro,The hotel was fine and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I was just surprised that there was no free newspaper.
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Gets the Job Done,This hotel was perfect for us. We went to DC for a conference but went a few days early to play. The hotel has a shuttle that leaves every hour and takes you to the metro. We got around perfectly from there. The room smelled like it used to be a smoking room and they've been trying to cover it up for a few months but it was livable. The pool was a little creepy and cold at night but that didn't stop us from swimming every night. All in all a great place for the money.
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,Internet problem,They have a wifi problem and i have to call the 800 toll free number for the troubleshooting. This is not my job to call technical staff 3-4 times and sole the issue. They troubleshooted it and agian the same problem
Best Western Capital Beltway,2,Not impressed,"I'm surprised this hotel is even part of the Best Western chain. They supplied only one wash cloth. We got a conditioner bottle, but no shampoo. Our food was thrown away even though we had it neatly stored in a box on the coffee table. The buffet breakfast was lacking. It had stale donuts and danish. The only hot food was hard boiled eggs and grits. On the positive side, bed was comfortable and good front desk service."
Best Western Capital Beltway,1,JUST SAY NO!!,"We had 10 rooms asked the GM in advance to put the rooms close she said she would do her best. At check in, the front desk never received anything from their GM about our group. The hotel was dirty, online pics are deceiving. The rooms reeked of smoke some of us changed rooms. There was hair everywhere. I never saw a cleaning lady the entire time. There were only sheets on the beds, when I called the front for blankets they only had one to give to us so I gave it to my kids. The elevators were small filthy. Club guests were loud yelling in the halls from 9pm-3am. I had to ask the people next door to quiet down so my kids could sleep. Guests were smoking cigarettes weed in their rooms which overflowed into the halls. We had rooms on the 5th 6th floors it was like this for everyone. The pool was gross. The breakfast was decent, but they ran out of some food early. The staff was always nice besides the lady in the breakfast room who reminded me of a grumpy cafeteria lady. I had to wash everything that I took into that hotel when I got home, even if it was clean. My car stunk of stale cigarettes from our stuff being in it I had to get it detailed to get the smell out. This is not a family friendly hotel in any way, shape or form, DO NOT bring your kids here. If you want a cheap party hotel with a club where you can pass out drunk not care, this is right up your alley. Do yourself a favor spend the extra money."
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,better than I expected,"nice room with comfortable bedding and pleasant staff (especially the gentleman at the front desk)... only issue was the lady who worked in the breakfast room... she was having a meltdown over people eating the bacon... it was embarrassing... otherwise, a very nice experience"
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Easy access to New Carrollton metro station,Its nice. We stayed for a night and its quite convenient as its closer to metro station.
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,bad wifi,wireless internet service was scarce and could not connect to the internet at all. Please expand the coverage of your hotel's wireless internetnetwork.
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Used this hotel 3 times before,"Find this hotel good value. Not many frills but friendly staff. Shuttle to metro big plus. Breakfast basic, recently added waffles, they appear popular."
Best Western Capital Beltway,1,Un pleased,"This was by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The rooms where not clean. The showers did not work well( went from hot to cold, then hot then cold) I had to unplug the tv to plug in the microwave because they did not accommodate for both. Just an unpleasent experience. Certainly wasn't worth the price ."
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,Quick Beltway getaway,"Decent hotel to stay, fairly close to DC, close to the Beltway"
Best Western Capital Beltway,1,"Snel doorrijden, geloof de postivo's niet!","Wat een desolate toestand. Achterstallig onderhoud in het kwadraat in een desolate omgeving. Vieze lucht als je binnenkomt. Tijdens verblijf nog brand op een andere verdieping, geen noodplan geen enkele coordinatie. Risicovol om daar te slapen!! Het eten was zeer slecht!"
Best Western Capital Beltway,5,Beltway review,"Hotel was great, it had a free shuttle to the metro, great continental breakfast and was in a good location with a few restraints in the surrounding area as well as a grocery store"
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,"Clean and quiet, good value","Clean, quiet hotel with good breakfast included in the price"
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Nice room and lobby,it was nice good location the staff was friendly and very helpful
Best Western Capital Beltway,2,Bad attitude staff,They told me my husband could check in without me but when he arrived they stated I had to be there. They were unprofessional with bad attitudes. There were grown women intoxicated knocking on doors and running. They were in the halls making a lot of noise. This hotel has a club inside and attract the wrong people.
Best Western Capital Beltway,2,Good Hotel But Needs to Take Care of Guests,"I want to emphasize that the problems I describe here were dealt with by the overworked night staff (desk manager and shuttle bus driver/handyman who went out of their way to solve the problem of our room. I have stayed in this hotel over the years but this was worst experience and perhaps the last time. It looks as if management has cut staffing to the bone. At hotel desk I waited for nearly 20 minutes. The clerk was with a guest of the hotel who had a problem. The guest explained the problem at least five times the clerk kept forgetting details -- because he never wrote anything down -- instead repunching the same mistakes into the computer over and over again. No one else came out to help and he kept repeating mistakes. The guest, a businessman, was very patient and stepped aside to let me check-in. The clerk finally got to me. We loaded up a baggage cart and went up to the sixth floor. We found a nice room at well over 100 degrees. It is seemed as if policy is to completely turn off air conditioning between guests. Downstairs lobby was cool and pleasant. Upper level lobbies and room were very hot. Room faced afternoon sun directly unshaded. We set the AC on cool hoped for the best. I went downstairs to use the business center which is a computer in an open area with children playing on it. A child got up but no obvious reset function for privacy and screen faced a group of children hanging out. Hotel also needs to reduce loitering in parking lot."
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Serves nice breakfast,This hotel is very nice. I loved their breakfast. Our room was big and clean. Didn't have any problem.
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,Bad luck,"The 1st night we checked in was the night the crazy storm hit DC. We ended up losing power that night (Fri) and it still hadn't returned as of Mon. While this was by not their fault, it made the stay quite dreadful. We had a busy day on Sat, as we were looking for houses (we're moving to DC) and didn't get back to the hotel until late the hotels with power were sold out. The room was disgusting, so we slept in the car and checked out on Sunday. Apparently, that was a mistake. The girl at the front desk said it shouldn't be a problem to get reimbursed for that night and the pre-paid nights we didn't stay. However, we were told to call the manager, who said that it is not customary for them to refund us for a night in which our things were in the hotel, even though it was miserable and we couldn't sleep there (I should mention that there was record-breaking heat). Ultimately, she refunded us for this night and we were satisfied. Had the power not been an issue, the hotel was pretty nice. The rooms seemed clean and were recently renovated. The staff was really nice too (even though they were hot tired). The location is pretty decent. They are currently working on the orange line though, so it's closed on the weekends at New Carrollton. Fortunately, the Greenbelt stop is about a 10 min drive away and there's free parking on the weekends. Ultimately, I think we just had bad luck and our stay would have been perfectly fine if the power hadn't gone out on day one."
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,servce,wonderful staff breakfast lady was wonderful sunday 9/13) room needs refrigerator noise guests on the floor
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Staff and amenities,The staff was amazing and the breakfast that came with our stay was great for the price we paid.
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Great stay!!!,Everyone was very nice and helpful.
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Very clean with full breakfast,"Great value hotel Rooms clean, easy check in and out. Nice selection of breakfast choices"
Best Western Capital Beltway,1,Bad area . Dirty,"This is a one Star hotel . Dirty , smelly , in bad area . Definitely will not chose BW in future"
Best Western Capital Beltway,2,Wouldn't recommend,The room was ok. The hall way was under construction so we heard constant banging all night. One of the hotel staff just walked into our room no knocking and then stared at us blankly asking if we had checked in. The wifi didn't work the front desk gave us a 1800 number to call so we could ask them to reset it. I would not stay here again.
Best Western Capital Beltway,5,i like it that was my 4 time in there,i like and im going back ::)
Best Western Capital Beltway,1,Pricey Crash Pad,"Stayed at hotel for a football game nearby. Shower didn't drain. Shower curtain didn't stay on the shower curtain rod. Maid never remade the room. Not enough power outlets handy to recharge the cell phones of the group in my room. Continental breakfast was so lousy, we ate breakfast elsewhere. Elevator was out of order upon arrival (was fixed during our stay). In dire need of a renovation. If you can book it for the same price as Motel 6, then go for it, otherwise avoid until a renovation occurs."
Best Western Capital Beltway,1,hair everywhere,There was Hair in the pool there was hair in the bathroom there was hair in the hotel room there was hair everywhere. There was a night club in the hotel of some sort that made it impossible to park and made my 2 kids and I feel unsafe in the parking lot.
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,BW Work trip 3 Decent stay,I stayed in a room near the vending area but it was pleasantly quieter than I would have expected. Also Major renovations occurring on all floors so it was dusty but no noise was heard at night.
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,Hotel in Lanham Maryland,"One of our rooms was above a restaurant/bar/lounge which was playing very loud music for several hours after midnight. The noise from the bar kept me awake for hours. As you can imagine, this made for a most undesirable stay. In addition, the temperature in the rooms was very cold and the beds had only a thin blanket on them. There were no extra blankets in the rooms and there was not a thermostat in the rooms that would have allowed us to control the temperature."
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Nice stay,"The only complaint I have about this hotel is that my sink was stopped up, but they did come and fix it right away. The toilet was running and continues until our stay, but that didn't bother me too much. They were repaying the parking lot and didn't have it posted anywhere and with them having the bar downstairs you had to park way over by the other building and walk to the hotel."
Best Western Capital Beltway,2,Disappointment,When we booked there was nothing to say about a dance club open only Friday and Saturday nights right below our room2nd floor. Also this club is not owned by the hotel and you have to pay to get into it also open to 330am and LOUD.. There is nothing in the area for miles in which to have a top notch meal only fast food frightening at best to order. Shopping is very little. Not a very safe neighborhood. Driving there not very easy to find. If you are going to an NFL football game driving to game is actually very easy only about 5 minutes but to take any other means of transportation is way out of the way and expensive.
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Lanham BW,"Past reviews made me skeptical, however, I was quite satisfied with my stay. The staff, room, and service was friendly, clean and professional - and this was during spring break! I will stay here again on my next trip to the area."
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,Decent for price.,"We checked in late...around 1 am. The lady at the desk was really nice and she was every night we saw her. I was disappointed with the front desk during the days. We needed clean towels at one point and were told we had to wait until housekeeping came in....which was one hour later! I know from other hotel stays that they could have at least got some for us to pick up. The room did smell a little bit musty also. Over all it was a decent stay. It did have a very convenient access to the highway heading in to D.C., so that was a plus."
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Good Hotel Value for Money.,"We came from Dulles(airport) in our rental car. The Front desk lady confirmed or Reservation were Given a Clean Room. As it was pouring pretty cold, switched on the huge Room Heater snoozed ourselves in. Breakfast next morning was Filling Delicious too.Decided to take Metro courtesy coach of Hotel dropped us off at New Carrollton.... More"
Best Western Capital Beltway,5,quality for price,"I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel. It does show its age, but was a very comfortable stay non the less. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The pool was a hit with the kids and it was great that they had an on duty life guard. Continental breakfast was more than your typical free breakfast with hot food."
Best Western Capital Beltway,5,Very good value for Washington,We were welcomed with cold drinks and a smiling friendly receptionist and manager as we looked tired after walking from the station. They asked why we had not rung for the shuttlebus (we tried but we had called the wrong number). We always used it since (the driver was NOT the smiling type). The continental breakfast was nearer a full breakfast as there were some cooked items.
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,"Nettes Personal , gemutliches Hotel","Schon der Empfang war sehr nett. Nach einem schnellen Check in, haben wir eine Philadelphiastadtkarte bekommen und einige gute und hilfsreiche Tipps. Sogar das Wechselgeld fur die Busfahrkarte wurde uns angebotenen. Super Service, Daumen hoch."
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Our stay at Best Western,"Our recent stay at Beltway Best Western was quite enjoyable. The facility was clean, comfortable and located close to major highways. The staff did an excellent job of providing for our needs and they were all very courteous and friendly. We would definitely consider staying at this facility in the future if we have to visit this area."
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,Work Trip 5- decent stay,Stayed on 6th floor and all was quiet. Evidence of remodeling was on many floors and in the stairwells. Employees were pleasant and helpful if and when you needed them.
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Value for the price paid,The hotel staff was helpful on information about DC and times the shuttle was a 10 minute ride from the hotel. The hotel is not new but had a nice indoor pool to rest in after a long day of sight seeings.
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,Nice budget hotel near DC,The facility was too old. But the front desk staff helped a lot.
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,Hotel room was dirty.,Hotel room was dirty after sleeping on pillow case observed a blood stain. Shower was awful.
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,vacationer,"There was a slim guy at the front desk who was very friendly and very helpful (e.g.- wrote out instructions to the Metro station). The women were efficient, but not nearly as friendly. The rooms were clean. We also liked the front lounge area. Pool needed some work and the exercise room could use towels (the towels would help to reduce the smell of sweat in the room)."
Best Western Capital Beltway,5,"Very nice hotel, friendly staff, good breakfast","Staff was very nice and friendly, quick check in and check out, good variety offered for breakfast, good location. Only inconvenience on the weekend our family stayed there was a convention happening at the hotel on the Friday evening which made the lobby area were crowded and noisy."
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Good enough.,Room in front of the elevator did not have isolation from the noice drunk people make coming drunk from downstairs ball room. Hey were loud and stood chatting right in front of our door. Room 608
Best Western Capital Beltway,1,Sucks,Guest services was amazing. The condition of the hotel left much to be desired.
Best Western Capital Beltway,4,Clean and comfortable Hotel,"Staff were very friendly in general. Breakfast had a good selection. Rooms were kept clean and towels provided daily. We noticed a lot of school parties stay here and that some people hung out in the hallways which generated some noise. We were not impressed that 2 nights in a row we had to evacuate at around midnight taking our sleeping son out of his crib/cot. Lounge was not open through the week only on a Friday and Saturday - depending where you stay in hotel you may hear some noise. We arrived on a Friday night and there was a function on we had to park far away but there is plenty of parking available. Our room had a Refrigerator, microwave, Iron plus board. There was a slight concern for us as we were told that there may be no cribs left but thankfully we did get one. We were disappointed that the swimming pool was only open 6pm-10pm Mon-Fri and on Saturday and Sunday's it was 2pm-10pm. There is a small shop in foyer where you can buy essentials and various other items and there is also a computer and printer in this area too."
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,weekday stay,"What I didn't like was the room was not good. When you walk in the hotel it looks awesome. But the room looked like you were in a motel rather than a hotel. Also the hotel was under construction from 9am to 7pm. That would have been nice to know before booking a room. The hotel staff were very polite and professional. The breakfast bar was the best breakfast bar I have had in a Hotel. Out of a 1-5, I rate the breakfast bar a 5. The staff were so on point."
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,"OK hotel for short stay, needing a place to sleep","This hotel is ok if you need a short stay, mostly for sleeping. I stayed two nights, using the swimming pool once. Cons: The breakfast buffet was of mediocre quality (worst is the pastry, tasteless and more like stale bread) The lobby was hot and humid, and could have been cleaner and neater The path to the swimming pool was horrible, filthy, flooded The pool itself is ok, warm, its floor littered with stuff - there is no change room or shower in the pool area Pros WiFi was of good quality, fast and no issue with login or usage Staff were friendly, helpful The bedroom and the bathroom were clean and neat The fridge and all lighting worked well"
Best Western Capital Beltway,5,Nice hotel with very friendly staff!,Clean and great customer service! Excellent place to stay.
Best Western Capital Beltway,5,Good stay for the money,"Overall very good stay..staff was very friendly. We at first were given a room without a fridge and microwave which we had booked. The front desk employee quickly changed our room and apologized immediately. Breakfast is from 630-10 and it's a great spread. The chef comes out to ask how everyone is doing and ensures the sterno and food supplies are fully stocked. Hot food, cereals, muffins,bagels,yogurt,fruit,pancake maker,burrito bar you name it they had it. Didn't feel rushed at all. We were 15 away from the city area and it's close to the highway which was convienient. Room was good but walls need to be insulated you can hear everything in the next room. Housekeeping was good. Pool wasn't open but that wasn't a major issue for us. Plenty of parking. Overall good stay we would come back."
Best Western Capital Beltway,5,A great place to stay,We checked in late (1:15 am) after a Monday night Redskin/Giants game - Hotel was full clerk at desk extremely busy but very accommodating to us. Our room was clean comfortable plus the refrigerator microwave I had requested was there. Breakfast was excellent staff friendly helpful. The clerk at checkout was relaxed friendly despite how extremely busy he was. We will stay here again next time we are in the area.
Best Western Capital Beltway,5,Best economy hotel ever stayed in,"The hotel is an economy hotel but it was one of the best my spouse and I stayed in. Everyone was very friendly. Upon arrival to my room, the receptionist called and make sure everything was OK. I do not even get this kind of service at high end hotels. So Kudos to the level of service. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The location is roughly 30-45 min drive to DC depending on traffic. The swimming pool was only 6pm-10pm on weekdays and only a few hours on weekends. So If you plan to use the pool you really have to plan for it. Overall my experience for this hotel was very nice."
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,OK for a quick one-night stay,"This was just an OK place to spend a night since it was close to our destination and was fairly inexpensive. You can tell it was an older hotel that has been renovated. Room was cleaned, but smelled of air freshener, probably to hide a smoke smell. Just didn't have that usual new Best Western feeling."
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,Good for the price and location,Good for its purpose which was to stay there only long enough to sleep. Fan in room was so loud that we had to shut the air off for the night. Lots of road noise. The breakfast was good with lots of options and great service by the folks managing it.
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,OK Place - could be better,I stayed there with our team. Beds were average. Shower was good. Housekeeping staff seemed OK. We stayed with our team. All of the staff didn't know that we are staying there and we need separate room too eat etc. So we ended up in lobby eating dinner etc. Breakfast was decent and the room was always setup. The staff... More
Best Western Capital Beltway,2,Best Western -Lanham MD,"The hotel was very unclean and the staff acted as if it was a chore to do their job. I had items let in my room from previous consumers. My room had cob webs in the ceiling and the bathroom was dirty. I spoke with the front desk and she was very nanchalant, telling me someone would call be back but to this day no one called me back. My car almost got towed because the front desk person forgot to give me a parking pass to park on hotel property. I had to rushout to speak with the tow truck gentleman, then she gently said O i'm sorry, I forgot"
Best Western Capital Beltway,3,Pas terrible,"L'hotel en lui-meme n'est pas trop mal, les chambres aussi mais l'environnement n'est pas terrible. C'est une zone en bord d'autoroute, dans un suburb glauque, et quand meme tres loin du centre de Washington (30-40 minutes en voiture). De la fenetre de la chambre, vous avez la vue sur l'autoroute ou le toit de l'hotel avec plusieurs grosses climatisations qui tournent en permanence, d'ou un un bruit incroyable ! On se croirait encore dans l'avion.... Pas de restaurant digne de ce nom autours. La piscine est limite propre (l'eau est quasi opaque....) et praticable, bien que tres grande et surveillee. En revanche, le petit-dej est correct !!"
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,5,Loved it!,"Will stay here any time I'm in Virginia Beach. I truly have no complaints at all. Free cookies at check-in, the most comfortable beds and pillows ever, and one of the cleanest hotels I have ever stayed."
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,4,Great room for the money,room was excellent. Had to wait too long for my room because of lack of knowledge from hotel desk clerk. I reserved a Kingsize bed/sofa bed for three adults. Desk clerk misunderstood the reservation. I would have preferred more hot items to choose from for the breakfast that was available.
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,4,Hamton Inn Virginia Beach,The hotel is neat and clean. Staff is friendly. It as at convenient location from the beach.
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,5,Virginia Beach,"Very beautiful, quiet and decent priced hotel. A little far from the beach but we enjoyed the pool when we came from the beach."
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,5,Godt familie hotel,Rigtig godt hotel Super sdt personale Ca15min fra stranden
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,5,Great hotel,Great hotel for the price. Breakfast was delicious. Convenient location to main highways. Would definitely stay here again if I was in the area.
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,5,Very Impressed,"As always, our room was very clean. The hotel itself was up to date and clean. Breakfast was excellent each of the four days. I left my laptop charger and housekeeping was right on top of it in getting it back to me."
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,5,Great deal for your money.,The manager Robert and Nature were very courteous and professional. Great Breakfast and a reception is held on Wednesday night for guests. We were extremely pleased with this hotel and would definitely stay again. Entire staff was great.
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,4,The front desk staff were courteous.,"Amazing. Just 12 mins from the beach, donning, and other attractions. The breakfast was excellent!"
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,5,Very nice hotel,"The staff was very friendly, rooms were clean, beds were comfortable and breakfast was always good."
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,5,Great deal for the price,"I needed an affordable hotel close to Fort Story. The Hampton Inn was perfect. The bed was very comfortable. The toiletries in the bathroom were of high quality, Neutrogena. anytime we needed anything (extra towels, paper plates for the pizza we had delivered, etc.) the staff was quick to help us. And having a hot breakfast with lots of options was great, too. There is an outdoor pool, but I did not use it. There is also a small workout room with a treadmill, an elliptical trainer, and a stationary bike, as well as weights. The neighborhood is very quiet, with a 7-11, Ruby Tuesday's, and a Rite Aid within walking distance. Freeway access was also very easy from there."
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,3,"Bad smell, noise",Towels chlorine smell Too much noise on alleys and rooms
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,5,Hampton Inn Va Beach Greenwich,"Hotel was a good choice, about 10 mins from the actual beach but me and my family were satisfied. It would have been 100 perfect if there was an indoor pool, but it wasn't. Great hotel though!"
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,3,Mike's review,"Stay was OK. They took a 50.00 temp. auth. charge on my credit card for a pre-paid room. That was ok, but it is not 5-2-14, and the charge hasn't as yet been removed. I was told the temp charge would be removed within 3 work days. I'm not happy about this."
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,5,"Hotel was just what i expected. Clean, comfortable",Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the city. Had other obligations that put us on a short time schedule. Hope to visit again in the future. The location of the hotel was perfect. We were there for a 86 year old Aunt's birthday.
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,5,cleanliness of room and great breakfast.,The rooms and service was great. I can honestly say it has the best free breakfast at any I current have stayed at.
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,5,Great convenience,Perfect for our needs. Convenient to freeways for quick access to anywhere in the Norfolk and Virginia Beach area.
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,3,In between,Not to cleanest or the dirtiest. Great breakfast buffet. Nice staff.
Hampton Inn Norfolk/Virginia Beach,4,good trip,The hotel and the staff were wonderful
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",5,Brew tour,"The room was a little on the to hot side and could not lower the temperature at all. The bed was not very comfortable. I believe it needed a new mattress. Other than that, price, location, decor, etc was great."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",5,"Great location, very modern","My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay for a quick Baltimore weekend getaway. The hotel is small but the rooms are big. There were a lot of mirrors, and the kitchenette allowed for a second sink and counter top to get ready. We were on the second floor, so the noise from the street was pretty loud, but not to the point where it kept either of us up all night. The breakfast is a pseudo-hot breakfast... no eggs or meat but it did have a waffle maker. Location is perfect, but at night it gets loud and rowdy, and there was some police activity just a block down (nothing bad, just drunken party goers). I would definitely stay here again."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",2,"Great staff, mediocre everything else.",The staff was great especially the valet. The room had no sound proof. Drunk people in the hall at midnight and we heard everything. We were on the 7th floor and everytime someone ran over a manhole cover we heard the noise clear as day. The worst was the tub though. You can tell they had a bath fitter installed but there was water between the old tub and the new liner so it felt as if we were showering on a water bed. Who knows what was growing in between the two surfaces. Also our one pillow had a big brown stain on it.
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",4,Nice boutique hotel very close to the water,This hotel is a block from the inner harbor in the middle of everywhere.
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",4,Inner Harbor getaway.,Hotel staff was very friendly. Everything went great.
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",3,Okay Hotel close to the Inner Harbor,For the most part we enjoyed our stay. We thought our room was much bigger as thats how it seemed advertised online and we also thought the lobby area would be bigger. We got stuck on the elevator had to pull the doors open ourselves to exit the elevator on the morning after our first nights stay. The staff was not very communicative about the elevator issues and did not really provide any real direction about updates /or ways to return to our rooms using another means other than the elevator.
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",5,Great Inner Harbor location,Great Inner Harbor location. The Staff is excellent and I will stay at this hotel anytime I am in Baltimorre
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",5,Convenient and Clean,"Amazing staff, very helpful, good breakfast. 1-2 blocks from all the tourist areas. We were there for a convention and its very easy to get to"
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",3,Hotel is fine but pricing deceptive...,"Price was a little bit deceptive...when I booked the room, it stated that breakfast is included. However, it is not included in the quoted rate...you are charged an additional 9.95 per day (mandatory) for 2 bottles of water and the breakfast, plus use of the fitness center. Since this is mandatory, it should be included in the overall rate. The room was fine but there was a funny, fishy smell in the hallway on my floor. Not sure what that was all about."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",4,Great location for this trendy little,"Great location, clean and nice hotel!"
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting a suite considering the name of the hotel but it was really a standard room. I overlooked that as I should have paid better attention but the room was not very clean. I found a dried up contact lense in our bed, there was mildew in the tub, and the room could have used a sweeping. The other issues we had was that when we returned from dinner the front desk worker was sitting on the couches with her significant other while there were children sitting at the hotel bar. Also later my husband ran out quickly to grab something from our car and this same hotel employee did not bother to look up from her phone when he entered the hotel. Last, I went to buy a snack and a drink later that evening, the same employee was on a clearly personal phone call did not even notice I was there. I seriously could have taken the stuff left and she would not have noticed. We have a returned visit to Baltimore and I don't think we will be staying here again."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",3,no parking of any kind,It was good all but the a/c not working properly but no parking
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",3,Would not stay here again,"The renovations in my room were very inconsistent. On the positive side, the living area and the bed room were nicely updated with modern furniture, quality curtains, and a very comfortable bed. But, the kitchenette and bathroom looked as though they hadn't been updated in decades. The cabinet doors were hanging askew, the bathroom door was in desperate need of paint, and the tub was old, stained, and yellowed. Also, I had a remote control that didn't work, a lamp that didn't work, and a drain that stopped up and spilled water into the floor. I wouldn't stay at this hotel again."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",5,Great room at great price near convention center,"I needed a room near convention center, very satisfied."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",3,Great location,"Decor was nice, and room was comfortable enough. Felt there was poor temperature control/ air circulation was poor, even with room fan on it felt too warm. Location in proximity to harbor was very convenient, with everything within walking distance."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",5,Nice weekend getaway,Me and my family had a great time for a last minute trip
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",4,Nice close to inner harbor.,We visited to be close to the theatre and inner harbor. We had a pleasant stay and were close to our planned activities. I would recommend to others.
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",5,Room Service,"I stayed at the Brookshire Suites for one week and enjoyed my stayed. One thing that I was really disappointed with was the room service they did not do a good job at cleaning the room. Out of the 5 days that I stayed there, I only allowed room service to clean my room on the third day. I expected them to resupply me with all the essentials in the bathroom. I was short on towels, soap, and shower gel. I was more furious when I notice that they did not provide me with a trash bag for the room trash can. Not to mention that when I walked in on the first day of my stay, under the sink there was a bag filled with trash from the previous stay. It did not bother me at first but after noticing how awful there room service is led me to write this review."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",4,Close to Inner Harbor and Ft. McHenry,"Great location though the property needs work. Staff incredibly kind and helpful,especially Curt in the evenings."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",5,Couples time away,Wonderful accommodation and loved the area. We'll definitely be back!!
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",3,Great location,"Location was great. Rooms were big, but fixtures n outlets some didn't work n outdated, vent in bathroom partially hanging down n dusty. You could either watch tv in dark or have lamp on."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",4,walking distance to everything,Great location. A lot of hidden fee's but still a better bargain than most.
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",5,My stay,Nice quiet hotel in the middle of all attractions. ..clean and beautiful rooms.
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",2,Disappointed,Arrived and had prev reqd a king or queen suite and was given a wheelchair accessible dble. And was told that's all they had. However a couple that were friends of mine later called and made a reserv and recvd a king suite! Additionally our heat was broken all week end and it was quite chilly. They attempted to repair twice w/no luck.
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",5,A well-designed hotel with great staff,"The Brookshire Suites was a perfect place to base ourselves while exploring Baltimore. It's walking distance to the water, to the Visionary Art Museum and to plenty of wonderful restaurants. For those who are looking for an experience instead of just a box room, this is the place for you: an overall well-designed feel with great art and friendly staff! We already booked this for our trip back in the fall."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",5,Will stay again,Wonderful. Spacious room. Friendly staff
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",5,Great stay for Army-Navy Weekend!,We stayed at the hotel for the Army-Navy weekend. It was a WONDERFUL stay. The rooms were great- large- kitchen area with huge living room and a very comfortable bed. It was just one block from the Inner Harbor. The staff was outstanding!!! They were very helpful in answering any questions and gave very helpful suggestions for restaurants. We would definitely stay there any time we go back to Baltimore and the Inner Harbor.
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",3,Mediocre hotel with hidden charges,"This hotel could use upgrading. It is clean enough, but truly bare bones. Of greater concern was the mandatory destination fee of 9.95 per day that tacked on the bill. There was no option to decline it, and I was not informed ahead of time. In essence, it adds 10 to the room charge. I booked this hotel because the price seemed reasonable. But at 10 more per day, I could have stayed at a nicer hotel for the same price."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",4,Nice place to stay with a great price.,"A great place to stay with a great price, will definitely stay there again. Continental breakfast was included with the price."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",2,Hotel was close to the Inner Harbor,"There City of Baltimore was having a water problem because of the extreme cold temps. The desk staff did not tell us at checkin that we may have a water problem in the room. We first found out about this not having water in the toilet, That was eventually rectified but we did not have any hot water. After unloading a family ( 6 and 3 year old) in the desk staff told us to go to dinner and there SHOULD be hot water when we return, No t want to risk that option we ask for a refund and that we woudl be leaving. The desk staff was reluctant at first to give the refund but when I insisted because they could not guarantee hot water they finally did. They failed to understand that a hot water issue was a hotel problem not a City of Baltimore."
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",4,close to trade show,The hotel was fine. It was in walking distance to the convention center. The room was clean and comfortable
"The Brookshire Suites Inner Harbor, BW Premier Collection",4,Wonderful staff and location!,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here! It is mostly an average hotel, even a little run down in areas. BUT the incredible service (particularly from the Valet Parking staff) and close proximity to the Inner Harbor totally made up for all that. Highly recommend using their Valet service, the guys were very helpful and accommodating...they even let us keep our car there after we checked out and locked our luggage in the storage room at no extra charge! Not sure if this is part of their regular service, but we were sure happy with the arrangement! The beds were soft and super comfy, room was clean and relatively quiet from downtown noise, showers were hot with good pressure and breakfast the next day was decent. A solid choice for anyone on a budget wanting to be close to downtown!"
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,2,Cockroach in bed,"Old building, the door didnt close properly you could see the light of the hallway through the side of the door, there was a love cockroach in the bed our first night."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,1,Very Disappointed,"I asked for non-smoking room but doubt very much that the room assigned was non-smoking. It literally stinks. The surrounding of the property was poorly maintained, hardly swept. The outdoor pool area was even worst. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned for weeks. The garbage cans were overflowing from the day I get there. The following evening, it was still the same way. This should be rated as .5 star."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Comfortable room for the money,The room was very clean. Nice desk and chair. Friendly and efficient staff.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,2,Hotel not up to standards,"The room was not clean my wife had to clean the tub in the bathroom,and around the toilet the carpets were dirty, the t.v. kept blanking out and the WiFi didn't work."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Very Nice Hotel For The Price,This was a very nice hotel for the price. The room was very clean and the hotel staff was nice. Close to many restaurants and other business establishments. They do not have a work out facility but do have an association with the local YMCA and you can go there to exercise free of charge. I will go back there again when I have business in the area.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,2,You pay for what you get,"If you're on an extreme budget then stay! Or just for one night!!! But, I'd pay the extra money and stay at the Marriott otherwise... It wasn't that clean: the carpet, walls, the place needs up grading"
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,just fine,"room was clean, and well maintained. hotel is older, had to keep getting a new key card. for some reason mine would stop working each day. hotel was fine, nothing fancy, but was comfortable"
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Clean Pet friendly,"Very convient location, but a little difficult to get to off the interstate.. You need to make a right at the light and make a U turn. The room was nice size, had a fridge and micro. No oder untill we turned on the AC unit.. nothing a little frebreeze in the filter didnt fix. The walls were a little thin, but didnt matter much, as the puppy heard everything and anything from a mile away.. hahahaha.....The front desk folks were just great. Some of the friendliest I have run across in hotels. Breakfest was good, Waffels, cereal, juice, coffee.. ect. Will def stay there again because of the pet friendly/no fee."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Great find,We were glad to find a great place for a great price. We even got out for a walk after our flight and found the area to be safe and easy to walk around. The people were nice and the breakfast decent. We'd definitely recommend it.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,"Virginia Beach, Newtown Road Hotel",I love that Denny's is right beside the hotel...that is one of the reasons why my family and I had came back to stay here again on our vacation. I did not like us getting non smoking rooms when I had reserved smoking in the first place. Unpacking in the wrong room then packing up again to move in the right room made me a little upset. Most nights that I had stayed there I couldnt sleep that well because of kids running up and down the hallways and knocking on our doors and running away. I believe the hotel staff should of been montioring the 3rd floors better than they had. The air conditioner did not work at all in room 343 and it got really hot in there.I believe the bathrooms could of been a little more cleaner than what they were. I had asked for a rollaway bed and didnt get one because they were all out. I asked for more pillows and blankets and all they gave me was two blankets. Yes it was pretty close to beach and zoo and all the must see sights. Next summer I plan on coming back to Virginia Beach but I will probably rent a beach house on Sandbridge for a week.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Decent place,"The bed was broken but was still comfortable, just a bit sunken in. The floor was a bit dirty but overall everything was good."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,I've to think about coming back to this hotel,"I got lost when I first arrived there. I couldn't find the place even though I have GPS Navigator. It was scary at night time, my mom and I was freak out we thought we saw spirit after midnight"
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,"Nice motel, close to convention center and beach","The staff was very welcoming and helpful. We were in town for a cheer competition and so were a lot of other girls...lots of doors opening and closing, To be expected."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,It served its purpose,Only issue for me was no microwave and fridge at most hotels I've stayed that's just standard
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Got the job done,"Didn't stay long enough to really review things, but the room was pretty clean, even though I think my toilet was leaking. Speaking of toilets, you kinda have to jump over it to get to the shower which has a really low shower head. Not good for a 6' tall person. Be wary of the elevator, it's kinda creepy. Didn't get to check out the pool, but it looked decent enough. Friendly front desk service. Not the best location as far as traffic goes, but it's 15 minutes from most anything (amphitheater, beach, etc) so it was a pretty good spot to spend the night. If you're wanting an ocean-view, look elsewhere. It's worth the price I paid."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,La Quinta,"ALows pets. Guests with pets should be more conscientious about cleaning up in the public areas. Stained carpet in the hallway, mess in the elevator. Rooms were very clean though."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Hotel fine rowdy guests (winning high school sports team lenient chaperones),"Hotel graciously granted my request for a different room, as I was assigned a 3rd floor room between several occupied by very boisterous girls basketball team. Teachers/coaches let them run wild until well after midnight. Unfortunately the team continued to run up and down corridors on all 3 floors."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,2,not worth the stay,this hotel was dumpy. the layout was strange. I will probably never stay at a La Quinta again.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,La aquinta inn in Norfolk,Business require that we be in Norfolk early in the morning. Rather than fight the traffic from our home to Norfolk early in the morning we opted to stay in La Quinta. It was only 10 minutes from our appointment. The desk attendent was very helpful with direction. we arrived at our meeting rested and relaxed. If the opportunity arose for us to make an early morning visit again we would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again. We were well pleased and could recomend it to anyone.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,2,Run Down,My room was clean but everything was run down. The carpet was ripped and coming up near the door and the bedding looked like it came from the 70s. The only good thing was the new flat screen TV. My stay was ok but I would not stay there again the area isn't all that great and I did not feel safe going to my car.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Great deal Great Location,"Our experience was near perfect - clean room and facility friendly helpful staff, Dog friendly with NO FEE, upgrade breakfast menu, just off I-295 so minutes from all major vacation or business locations all for half what you would pay for same elsewhere"
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Excellent stay.,That was the best most comfortable hotel stay I've ever had. Good breakfast and very friendly staff. I recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to VA Beach.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Va. Beach LaQuinta,"We stayed at the LaQuinta only one night, but will return at every opportunity. They're pet friendly which is wonderful. Now my baby can be our traveling companion. The room was great, clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and we were very pleased with our stay."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Great,I will be returning the service was excellent
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Commentaire,"Malgre 21Km de la plage le voyage se fait bien avec la voiture, hotel propre bon service, et petit dejeuner genereux Par contre les lits de ma chambre n'entaient pas confortables."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,1,I should not be charged for this experience!,"Noisy hotel, paper thin walls and not conducive to sleep. We stayed here because it was near the hospital and we heard they offered a special rate for hospital patients. We were not offered a discount rate and got no sleep before surgery either! Hippy dog in halls at 2 am, car traffic late night and early morning, dark surroundings with little security are reasons why we will never stay here again. Also, no smoking room reeked of smoke especially when bathroom fan was turned on. Morning receptionist did nothing to resolve."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,2,"Nice Staff, BUT.......","While the staff was nice, the keys for the door did not work (old eighties style with many holes. The place smelled like cigerette smoke and was very dirty. The surrounding neighborhood was scary and the parking lot entrance was hard to find."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Nice for the price,The exterior does not look super attractivebut very nice on the inside. The room was comfortable and had updated appliances. Loved that it is a pet friendly hotel that did not charge additional fees. Would highly recommend to others.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Pleasant stay,Hotel is older with low ceilings in the hallways and does need some updating. Room was clean and stay was comfortable.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Repeater,THis is second time I've stayed here. Good bang for the buck.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Fine for a night,"This is an older property but it's clean. Nothing fancy, and I wouldn't recommend this for more than a night, but it was fine for what we needed. Breakfast was okay - more cold carbs than anything else! There is a Denny's in the parking lot as a back-up!"
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,What Happened To Customer Service,Front Desk Staff was not very friendly at check-in. Breakfast was a trainwreck do to soccer team taking complete ownership of the breakfast area. I would recommend the hotel because of its convenient location between VA beach and Norfolk downtown aside from the poor treatment displayed by the front desk staff.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Worth the price,"The hotel rooms are very nice, and clean. It would be nice if the rooms had a refrigerator or microwave. Overall I enjoyed my stay and will be staying again in the future."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Would use this Hotel again,"We stayed here for 4 days, the staff were very friendly, breakfast was good, rooms were clean, as was the swimming pool. i would recommend this hoel to my friends an family."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Good,I liked the hotel staff for quality of staff.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,"Comfortable, relaxing, and affordably priced.","Avery comfortable bed, a desk fr laptop set up, and a fridge and microwave made the somewhat extended stay very pleasant and relaxing. Breakfast allowed guests to fuel up before a busy day."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Good Budget Stay,The hotel was not far from the beach and many other attractions.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,1,Wouldn't Stay Here Again,"Good location, but DIRTY hotel! In my opinion, it should be DOWN-rated to a 2-star hotel. It's OLD, the room I stayed in smells musty, and the common areas were DIRTY!"
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,"Busy, but friendly",As an adult couple it was a little overwhelming to have a hotel filled with young people there for a competition. It was nearly impossible to take advantage of the breakfast service. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Stop along the way.,Short overnight stay. The staff was great. Very friendly and welcoming. The hotel is a bit dated and in need of a few fixes. Tub and toilet are is very small. So small the door hit the toilet when closing. Overall this was a nice stay. Bed was comfortable. Lots of room space and dog friendly. I would stay here again.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Comfortable stay,"Room was clean and comfy, close to food and shopping. Great for weekend or business travellers ."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Would go there again........,I thought the overall experience at the hotel was very good. The only thing I did not like was that the cleaning of the room was late in the day after 2pm.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Great Place,We were tired from a very long drive from Boston and were very happy with everything that we saw. The staff were very professional and very nice. The bed was very comfortable. I would highly recommend this place. The Breakfast was very varied and great. Everything was fresh.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,great 3 day stay,"I was nicely greated as I entered the lobbie. while checking in they had my packet ready which included may of area, coupons and suggestions of activities. Very friendly staff throughout my stay."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Comfortable Stay,The hotel was very accommidating for me and my dogs! The staff was very friendly and helpful.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Mediocre hotel with a great staff,"I was disappointed with the cleanliness of the room, which was very dated. The staff was super friendly, and I appreciated that. The breakfast area was crowded, and being on of the first rooms in the hotel, it seemed everybody wanted to walk by having a conversation at full volume while I was trying to sleep."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Our Stay,Manger..Rachel very nice..water pressure in toilet bowl. .u have to wait a long time. .to flush. .bathroom floor dirty. .I clean it! our view looking out bedroom window..was a meter of some kind..breakfast was nice! !.Building needs good panting out side. .It was quite. .Close too the stores nice. ..I would stay again..
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Great value,"We chose the place partly part of the bad reviews, we suspected that peoples' complaints might be a little silly and we were right. The room is comfortable, clean, fresh and new. The staff is friendly. Breakfast is nothing to write home about, but it's not important as there's a Denny's right next door."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,would stay at again,"would stay at again. clean, comfortable and resonably priced. about a 15 min drive to the beach"
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,nice hotel close to highway,the first day we went to the comp. breakfast and it was terrible!!! food was stale and cold! there were no towels for the pool and the maids gave us a hard time about giving towels out.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Concert stayover,was a decent room clean but barebones. Quiet and convenience of free breakfast. Besides a Dennys too
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,2,Unprepared workers,"When I first walked into the hotel(at approximately 15 minutes after check-in) there were about 3 or 4 employees sitting at tables and chairs at the entrance. (This was the common area where the continental breakfast is served). Upon check in I was told there were no rooms available. The employees had not finished cleaning the rooms. I am from NJ and was in VA for the weekend. The front desk clerk asked me if I had anywhere else to go while they had the opportunity to finish cleaning the room. The check in time stated on my reservation was 3:00 p.m. Apparently, the hotel did not receive this message. Eventually, I was able to receive a room. However, I definitely will never stay at this hotel again due to the bad service received at check in and for the attitudes of some of the employees."
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,for concert,"The hotel definitely shows age and tons of wear. We had two rooms both in somewhat poor condition that both smelled strongly of smoke (non smoking rooms). Stains, tears, and burn marks pretty much sums it up. Staff was very friendly!"
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Wonderful! Especial nice for persons traveling with pets!,Wonderful! Especial nice for persons traveling with pets!
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Not that bad,It was ok for the price. Brake fast is goog the room has little bit smell
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Good for a few nights.,It's about 15 mins from beach. You are not near it. No microwave. No refrigerator. But good for the money. Breakfast is very busy. Pool was closed only one day of our stay.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,5,Irma getaway,Truly a nice hotel. People very friendly and helpful.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,2,bad,"I was verry disAppointed. With the house keeping service, no towels, bed wasn't done cause we left a a pant on the bed, no cofffe......i hated.....i hate to ask for everything when is suppose to be done w out asking"
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,3,Ola!,good place to stay for reasonable price. Easy access to VA Beach.
La Quinta Inn Norfolk Virginia Beach,4,Buon prezzo e vicinissimo a Virginia Beach,"La nostra camera era pulita, spaziosa e il letto molto comodo.La colazione e la solita che si trova in questi posti,era ok.Abbiamo scelto questa struttura per un pernottamento, in viaggio. Rimane un po' fuori a Norfolk, ma e anche vicina da Virgina Beach e per cui era una ottima scelta, visto i prezzi che ci sono al mare. Consiglio questa struttura a viaggiatori o anche per lavoro senza problemi.La qualita ricevuta per il prezzo e buono."
Holiday Inn Secaucus Meadowlands,5,Good facilities around the hotel,Great
Holiday Inn Secaucus Meadowlands,5,Impatiente d'y retourner,"Hotel tr√®s bien situ√© pour se rendre √† new-york (port authority bus terminal √† 10 min autobus en face de l'hotel #320, 3.15$) Chambre tr√®s pratique avec micro-onde et frigo emplacement calme apr√®s une journ√©e pass√© dans la jungle de NYC. Chambre de qualit√© sup√©rieur."
Holiday Inn Secaucus Meadowlands,5,Highly Recommended!,"Very convenient location. Hotel very convenient for traveling in New York City. Recently renovated, very comfortable and clean beds, modern furnishings (LCD TVs), granite counter tops in bathrooms. Good price too! Taking the bus from New York City to the hotel takes only 15 minutes. The commute in can be a little longer, up to an hour, so leave lots of extra time traveling into NYC. The Wal-Mart next to the hotel was very convenient for last minute things. Would return next time I go to NYC. The hotel restaurant never seemed to be busy though, even at night."
Holiday Inn Secaucus Meadowlands,4,Nice Hotel easy access into NY City,We stayed at the Holiday Inn on a weekend shopping trip to NYC. Our flight arrived at 8am and was traveling with my 3 month old baby. They let us check in early which was nice. It was very easy to go to NYC #320 bus just outside the hotel with a 20 min bus ride to Port Authority. Wifi could not access from our room had to go to lobby to get internet. Other then that it was good. Lots of dining options just outside the hotel. Walmart 5 min away. Would stay there again.
Sanibel Inn,4,Amazing location wonderful atmosphere,We visited the Sanibel Inn whilst on holiday in Naples as we'd spent a day on the Island the year before. The Inn was in a great location.

Sanibel Inn,5,Waking up to a Lovely View,"We are midway through our week at the Inn. We are enjoying our stay. We chose gulf front and have not been disappointed.

Sanibel Inn,4,Perfect for girls weekend.,We stayed in a 2 bedroom unit with kitchen and view of the gulf. The room was very clean and the beds were comfortable.

Sanibel Inn,4,Loved it!,My sister and I have been coming to Sanibel once or twice a year now for several years. At first we tried some other hotels but Sanibel Inn is now our only choice. It is a short walk to the beach. The rooms are neat and tidy. I love the little balcony where we have time to enjoy the sound... More
Sanibel Inn,3,Good hotel on beach,The hotel is centrally located. The room was comfortable but a little worn. The staff was somewhat helpful but could have been friendlier. The quality of the drinks at the bar could have been better. Overall pleasant experience
Sanibel Inn,3,"Nice location and view, rooms could use some updating","We stayed 2 nights at the Sanibel Inn. We had a 1st floor Gulf view room in the Periwinkle building. While the room location and view were just what we wanted, we had a hard time getting past the musty odor in the room. It may be that rooms on a beach will suffer from some dampness, but this seemed... More"
Sanibel Inn,5,Nice stay at Sanibel Inn,"Very nice stay, advantage of free bicycle and paddle board as well as chairs umbrella on the beach"
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,4,Great room for the money,"it was nice and clean, though room set up was inconvinent.Breakfast was good.Good deal.Will stay again."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Killer Breakfast / Pool Party,"It rocked. Went for a two day concert, so many fellow showmates stayed at the hotel. The pool area was transformed into a pre-game party with food and tunes. The hotel and staff were outstanding. The only drawback was that it would have been nice if the hotel shuttle operated on the weekend."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Not bad at all,"The living room area was cramped and the cable wasn't that great but other than that, for the price the stay was good."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Nice hotel for a weekend getaway,"The hotel was nice for a weekend getaway. Nice staff and clean room. The best part was the full kitchen, which had everything you would need to cook and eat, all you need is to supply the food."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,4,good place to stay,"the place was great but has the wifi in the room doen't work when you try to enter the password on the screen or there is none shown but however, the network where it was available. if there is no connected to the password ,knowing it will not work.....the hotel must upgraded the router..instead of sending the guest to the starbuck."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,4,"Great hotel, but overly firm beds","I liked this hotel a lot. Service was friendly, suite was sizeable, clean, comfortable, with a decent view. Nice neighborhood with good nearby restaurants. The only issue I had was that the bed was too firm for my taste. Not too far from the airport and the mall."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,4,Comfy place,"The place is not in the greatest location, but the room is comfy, the breakfast is hot and the staffs are friendly. It seems there are a lot of people going there on weekends because I passed by it a lot of times on weekends and the parking lot always seems full."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,4,Thanksgiving pre-stay,"This hotel was located right off the interstate. Signage at the hotel was not visible until after you passed it. The hotel staff was very polite and accommodating. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The only complaint I had was that it was a handicap room so everything was set very low. Overall, our stay was very nice and we were surprised with the size of our suite."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Seeing My Grandson in Baltimore,Rooms are very comfortable and clean. The Staff was very friendly and nice.
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,3,The hotel was okay!,"The hot breakfast is a good idea but horrible. Plenty of towels, but need to invest in some fabric softener. The sheets were not fresh"
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Weekend at the ball game,"When we booked the hotel we knew that they were undergoing renovations so we expected some inconvenience. The checkin area was in a different location, all you needed to do was follow the signs. Checkin was fast. Our room was a 2 bedroom suite with a king in each room. The room was recently renovated and was absolutley beautiful. Plenty of room for 4 adults. We will be reserving a room again next September. There is shopping, food an liquor store right around the corner. The only downside was that our room was directly under the temporay breakfast cafe. If possible, that should be the last room to be checked into."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Very pleased,"The room was great - bright, clean, airy, spacious. Bed and pillows were comfortable. I thought the common areas were fine as well. Breakfast was great. My only complaint is that the halls and lobby are a little shabby looking. Carpet's worn front desk was sloppy. However, if I ever need to stay in Columbia again, this will be my spot."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,4,Modern and affordable. Highly recommended!,"My boyfriend and I stayed here a weekend in July for our anniversary. Wanted to visit Baltimore but not pay the prices for the Inner Harbor hotels. This hotel was perfect. It was extremely affordable for a 2 night weekend stay and surpassed our expectations. It was only a 15 minute drive to Inner Harbor. The staff was very friendly and the room was great. Room was spacious, updated and SO clean. Felt like a mini apartment. Also one of the few hotels we found that had an outside pool. I would definitely recommend this hotel!"
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,3,Too much noise,"The hotel was noisy at night. The staff did little about it. Despite the updated look, the bed felt like it was old (lumpy)"
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Quality Columbia MD Hotel,"My lady and I occasionally enjoy overnight stays in hotels. We don't have a lot of money and hotels aren't cheap, so I'm very selective about where we stay. I selected Sonesta because it was close hey 97 and a short drive to Arumdal Mills Mall. I've been previously disappointed choosing familiar brand name hotels in Baltimore. I've learned that brands don't guarantee quality. I wasn't familiar with Sonesta but I figured the hotel had to be good because of the location. I didn't have a clue. Out of all the hotels I've visited within the past 2 years, this is the best. I could LIVE there. EVERYTHING was excellent."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Better than I thought,Perfect
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Excellent,"This was a last minute booking. You walk into clean hotel that doesn't smell like smoke. Staff was great and checked us in along with explaining the times for breakfast buffet, wifi access and other necessities. Room was big and clean. Soft bed, clean bedding, modern decor, kitchen with all necessities and clean bathroom. If I return definitely coming back here."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,haben uns sehr wohl gefuhlt,hier stimmte alles
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,4,Baltimore trip,Great stay would definitely stay here again
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Great hotel,"Clean spacious room, courteous staff, great breakfast. We were pleasantly surprised to find out that in addition to the warm breakfast, the Staybridge offered a light dinner Tues. through Thurs. We will definitely stay there again when visiting relatives in Columbia."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,2,Foundation issue for some rooms,"The hotel looked like it was in good condition, after entering my room, I noticed that everything in the living room and kitchen was a bit slanted which didn't really bother me. The floor was sloped causing everything to be slant, an obvious foundation issue or very poor construction. While I was in the bedroom, I heard voices and thought someone had entered into the suite, turns out it was people talking in the hallway and because of the slope, there was a 2 inch+ gap between the door and the floor. I was only staying at the hotel for 8 hours, so I didn't ask for a room change, but beware of what room you get."
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,2,Restless Night!,There was constant noise through out the night from noisey doors to guests talking loud. Sort of feels tile an apartment community. Certainly not my type of place for a good night rest.
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Wonderful Birthday Weekend!!,I had a wonderful experience with this hotel. It's minutes away from down town Baltimore and minutes away from other popular attractions. I can't wait to return! definitely a keeper!! I hit the jackpot!!
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Nice location near the airport.,Everything I needed was provided in a nice comfortable room.
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Only complaint,The air blowing from the furnace made the bedroom either too cool or too warm. Other than that I couldn't have been more pleased with every aspect of our stay at Sonesta. Thank you!
Sonesta ES Suites Columbia Baltimore,5,Wonderful stay!,"The suites are comfortable and clean, and the staff is wonderful. I know exactly where I'll be staying anytime I'm around Baltimore."

Courtyard Boston Woburn/Boston North,1,Ripped off,The girlfriend and I decided to take a trip to Salem mass for Halloween and upon checking Expedia found this hotel listed as 103 for 2 nights with only 1 room left available. Shocked at this amazing deal we booked immediately. When we arrived and tried to check in we were informed that we owed 230. I was outraged and demanded to talk to a manager who wasn't there. We ended up settling to stay only 1 night which was over 100 and then make our way to Salem the next morning after having breakfast and find somewhere else. We wake up the next morning to find out there isn't even a free breakfast! Very unhappy with this stay and will never go to this hotel or the franchise again!!!!

Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Staff helped out of the way as one of us was ill,Good value for money. An unplanned extension of our stay was possible at the same cost.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,1,Horrible Hotel/Rooms/Staff,When I arrived at my room it was unlocked. There was a strong musty smell. Being so tired I tried to go to sleep. I woke up not being able to breathe. (I don't have allergies) The hotel was full so I was unable to switch rooms. I asked to check out of the hotel. There wasn't a manager on duty so they refused to check me out. I will never stay at a Ramada facility again.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,directions,It is alittle hard to find Get detailed directions Fast airport pickup Very nice employees
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,1,Shouldnt Have to GO to Head OFFICE to Get Result,"We had no tv service and was told we could move or we could be taken care when we checked out.. we chose to stay in the room as we where unpacked , it was late and we were ready for bed. When we checked out we where then told we had to talk to the manager as we booked thru expedia. It took over week to track the manager down (i left at least three messages on her voicemail). Only to be told that their policy was to move us ... she was rude in her dealing with the situation...thats not what we where told at the time...when I pushed it i was given the option of 10 off my next stay..also ...it was a long weekend and the hotel was busy ... the breakfast area needed attended to...food running out and a little cleaning was in order...the front desk person was friendly and did her best to replenish and a very bus time for her at the desk...when i asked housekeeping for a new ice bucket (as ours had a crack in it and was leaking) she rolled her eyes at me and sighed like i was putting her out... this hotel could use some renovatons and attention in order to be up to Ramada standard. P.S. I fly alot and have used this hotel at least 3 or 4 times .... there will not be another stay there. and not recommending it."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Second Timers,"This is the second time that we've stayed in this hotel. The rooms are clean, check in/ check out was a breeze the continental breakfast wasn't bad either. I like that the hotel is secluded but the mall restaurants are less than 5 minutes away. Pretty good for a last minute find. Darn those airplanes though..... :-)"
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,In the middle of a move so just needed a bed,Pretty much blah... nothing really to write home about.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Not What I expect,This hotel definitely needs renovations. Up grades!!!
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,They have cheaper rooms and that what we were given. Not Impressed.,I had asked for a handicap room but did not get one. I guess I would rate the hotel as a 3. The road leading to the hotel was very rough....out of control of the hotel. The hotel offered a very small breakfast area....enough for maybe 6 people. Not what was pictured. Limited parking due to the bar and many Christmas parties.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Close to airport and Casino,"The hotel was clean, and the staff friendly."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,BWI,"It was NICE, The room was clean and close to where I had to conduct business the next day."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Just Okay,"The room itself was clean, however the AC unit is very loud. The breakfast offered is sub par, they only offer suites and other high carb items. Upon arrival at the airport it took an hour to be picked up."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Don't Rest at Ramada,"Having travelled over the past 6 months, this hotel for a 3 star location was very disappointing. First the decor is very old, dark, and non-inviting. Secondly, the Ramada is advertised in the Arundel Mills area, plenty of restaurants to choose from. However, on your way from the airport to the hotel, you realize that you are as far removed from as possible from anything nearby. They offer transportation to the Mall ( approx 4mi track) for 10.00. Obviously not customer-friendly. They infer that the transportation is to be free. Also, upon arrival in your room you discover there is no clock radio of any kind, there is no booklet to explain the amenities of the hotel or nearby attractions. When asking the front desk if if the booklet might have been taken, they sheepishly responded Wedon't have anything like that. The continental breakfast was ok noting that rarely was anyone from the staff keeping the items replenished or the juice containers from being completely out. After a 20 min return the orange juice was still out at 7:45 AM. Because of the lack of additional restaurant convenience I did eat at the hotel. The food was decent, but nothing to rave on and the cost was a little above average. Service at the restaurant was fair not because the servers weren't trying, tbut because there are only two servers period and one helps at the bar. Finally, there are no internet instructions posted in the room."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Meh..,"Very busy, efficient-enough airport location. Rooms quite OK.. housekeeping fine.. but hotel is getting run down. Some modern era touches lacking, i.e., not enough power outlets near desk or bed. Staff tries hard to accommodate guests. Irksome and preposterous 50/night 'incidentals' charge which is returned post-stay."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Nice hotel,My family of six wanted a hotel that would be comfortable but did not offer many amenities that would up the price because we did not plan to be in the hotel except to sleep. I found this hotel very comfortable and clean and would recommend it for a family on a weekend stay (as it is located in a technology park and might be busier during the week). It was relatively inexpensive and close to both Baltimore and DC.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,BWI Airport hotel,"So-so, it was ok. Location is not the best, nothing arround."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Nice place!,"Great experience all in all! Perfect for what I needed. Would stay again if staying in Columbia, MD area!!!!!!"
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,1,The Worst,"This hotel is like living in a construct zone. The hallways are not air cond and missing the baseboards. The room had chips in every wall. The bath tub has millldew stains around the edge. Hotel doors are not lock and in fact some could not be locked because the operating bar was missing. When I told them about the unsecured doors, the reply was that they had cameras. Breakfast was a joke - kids cerials, mini bagels and cupcakes with terrible coffee. Our flight was delayed a day and we checked out and used another hotel. Best description is it is run on the cheap. Shame on Ramada."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,Ramada BWI,"No Tissue box in the room or washroom. Room quality was poor. Cracks in the wall in washroom. Internet was pathetically slow, almost unusable, even late at night, very early in the morning. Would not stay here again."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Nice hotel close to airport and shopping,Room service (cleaning) was not done one day. I had to request room claening
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,lots of renovations,"the lobby must be the first place they renovated and it looks great but I stayed on 6 floor and everything in it was old and smelled weird, elevator squeaked all the way up not a great feeling, beds were comfy but I prefer queens"
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Weekend Trip,The staff was super friendly and went above and beyond to accommodate. I would definitely stay here again.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Ramada Inn weekend stay,We stayed a Friday to Monday and was a little put off by the Club music coming from the bar attached to the lobby but overall it was a nice stay. I loved how relaxed they were at the pool area so we could enjoy ourselves instead of feeling gawlked at. It must be a state law but I found it odd they had a lifeguard on duty for such a small pool but he was cool and pretty much stayed to himself the whole time. I didn't like the area and it was a hassle to get on the highway. I probably wouldn't stay there again but I didn't have a bad experience.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,One in Million!!!,Everything was Excellent!!! Quality Service! Will be coming Back!!!!
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Comfortable hotel,"We had a good stay in this hotel, it was clean and comfortable, everything was ok as far as the basic services, but the wireless internet did not work well at all during our 6 day stay. I would not recommend this hotel if you want reliable wireless internet access, I noticed that other guests had similar issues with the wireless access."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Smokey the bear,This is a great place for the price. The BWI Ramada has all the amenities that 1972 has to offer. Double check your shot record and book today.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,"Good hotel, minor issues.","It was a good hotel to spend for only one night there. The Wi-Fi didn't reach very well upstairs. Although, I overheard the staff indicate they were working on it. The hot water for the shower wasn't that hot or didn't have the potential to get that hot which could be good in a sense. I filled up an ice bucket and left it out overnight. The next morning, I discovered a dead cockroach. I don't know if that was a fluke, but that kind of shocked me a bit. I don't think bugs in general are very good. The area was quiet which was important to get some good sleep. The free breakfast was really good, the staff was super friendly, and the shuttle got me to the BWI airport fast. Overall, I think it's a good place, but needs a few things fixed. I recommend on the contingency those issues are fixed."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Nice Hotel,"I stayed here with my girlfriend for a week, and ended up spending one of those days in the room completely, due to her falling sick with food poisoning. The hotel was clean, comfortable and had a nice breakfast area. People have complained that it is small (which it is) but breakfast can be taken back to your room, which I preferred. There is a computer/printer available to print out tickets/boarding passes and this was very useful as we needed to print out some tickets to Six Flags in order to take advantage of an online-only deal. We visited the Parkstone Grille restaurant once (on the first night) and found it really nice. It was during a Karaoke night, so it was quite lively and everyone loved my english accent (although I didn't sing!) I wish I'd booked two weeks here as the time flew by so fast, and I already want to go back. I would book here again, although the location is a bit awkward if you plan to visit Baltimore on a daily basis (it's a good 30 minute drive each way) but it was close to Arundel Mill Shopping Mall, and some other amenities (such as the Airport)"
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,"A Good Place to Stay, If.....","This hotel gets the job done. It gives you a place to sleep... that is, unless the staff decide to give your room to someone else, like they did during my stay. Imagine my surprise as I lounged on the bed with my fiance watching TV when someone unlocked our room door and walked in with her luggage! Of course that meant we had to reset our keys. The hotel also gives you a decent breakfast the night after your stay. Unfortunately each of the juice containers dispense juice along with black residue that settles in the bottom of your cup, so you'll probably want to stick with one of the two hot tea options. Try to get a room on the upper floors, as there was a religious concert of some sort complete with electric guitars and full drum set on the bottom floor at 8:30 am Sunday morning. If you're trying to relax in your room after waking up, beware that it might not be that tranquil as the cleaning women yell at each other down the hallway for about 45 mins-1 hr as they clean your floor."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,Ramada,Breakfast the first morning had molded bagels and fruit. I would check the food before you eat it.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,must have a cae,"Great stay but if you don't have a car, your cab around would be 15 to the mall"
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Great hotel for a short stay.,"We stayed for one night after flying into BWI at 1:00 am. The complimentary airport shuttle was very convenient and the first driver we had was great! The second driver made us wait about 20 minutes while he was chatting it up with a woman that worked there which could have made things difficult if we were needing to be at the airport for a flight instead of just picking up our rental car. There weren't any restaurants or fast food within walking distance of the hotel and we were hungry after traveling all day, but they did give us some bagels and cream cheese because they felt bad. There really isn't much of anything by the hotel, but the beds were comfortable and it was a quick and easy check in. All in all, I would recommend this hotel for short stays like we had, but not for a long trip only because there isn't anything close by."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Short stay to catch a plane,Everything was Ok But not great Staff seemed to not want to be there
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,pretty good,Nice for a place to lay your head at night while you explore the city during the day
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Awesome,"I was driving from NY to NC and decided that I needed to rest. It was after 9pm . I pulled over to a rest stop and looked up Expedia for hotels near by. I got a hand full and picked one within my budget . What a relief to have that choice. my stay was pleasant , room was Clean, great staff. And free breakfast. Within 15minutes of booking , Ramada had my reservations. :)."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Not worth the price i paid,"We checked in at 3.30 am and the lady at the front desk didn't seem happy to see us. No greeting or smiling. She quickly gave us the keys and didn't bother to give us any information on breakfast timings or free wi fi. She was rude in short. The guy during check out was very friendly. The room was clean but the beds were very hard. The trash can in the room was nasty and when i looked at it by mistake i lost my appetite. It wasn't bad, but not worth the price i paid for it. For 10 more i could've stayed at bigger hotels close to it. Oh and breakfast wasn't anything to die for. We ended up not eating there."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,Price looks good but....,They don't tell u when u book a room but when u get there a sign is saying ur card will be charged an extra 50 a night and it will be refunded n 7-10 days...at this point its too late to cancel because they will charge u anyway...so that's y the price seems cheap but n the end ur paying more and its higher than other places..
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Ramada at BWI,"For the it was OK, I would stay again, the TV is an off brand and Made some noise on some channels, breakfast is OK, but nothing to write Home about frozen egg Mc muffins. I would give it 3 stars max"
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Ok for one night,"Wallpaper peeling in room, water drains slow in sink, soda machine was empty. Otherwise quite and clean."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Close to airport,"Reason for stay was to catch flight early am. Location is excellent to airport. Shuttle service efficient, although was somewhat crowded leaving. Return was very good. Also, hotel is close to restaurant I love to visit. Overall very good experience!"
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,poor,"this is not a 3 star hotel - on top of cleanliness issues, we had a two issues with wake up calls. One 2 hours early and the other which didn't come at all."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,NO FREE EXTENDED PARKING IF YOU BOOK ONLINE. +50,"Not sure who to blame. Expedia, says something about surcharge in one place, another place says nothing. Real pain to realize you got a good room rate, then need to fork out an extra 50 for parking. Of course no one takes responsibility. To their credit, the front desk did offer 35, since it was 5 days. 50 is up to 14 days. Expedia couldn't do anything."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,Bad,"Power went out due to a snow storm however, partial power was available. Light bulb was burned out in the bathroom though (unrelated to power outage. Hotel is very difficult to find, but the staff were courteous when I called for directions. TV cable is on satellite and most channels were not available due to the storm. Surprising that they're not on standard ground cable. Internet was lost as well due to power issues. Hotel was clean and nice, but dated. Exercise room is small and dated. Bar service was very slow and inefficient. Hotel did a good job clearing the parking lot and sidewalk of snow by morning. However, it would have been nice to have some help to open the sliding doors while carrying all my stuff to exit the hotel, which were difficult to open."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Awesome staff!,Overall great experience! The staff was excellent! I have never encountered such a friendly staff before my stay here! My only complaint would be the need for some updating in the showers....BUT other than that I absolutely would recommend to everyone!
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,"Overpiced, non in-room refrigerator.","Breakfast is light. The taste of Coffee needs improvement. Breakfast could benefit from addition of cold cuts, smoked salmon, cheeses, freshly baked breads and pastries and omelettes."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,Stay Away,"We made reservations on November 9, 2011 for a stay on the night of May 16, 2012 and specifically asked for a non-smoking room. When we arrived at 11 p.m., the desk clerk casually told us the only room left was a smoking room. No explanation as to what had happen to our reservation for a non-smoking room. No apology. She couldn't have cared less. The smell that greeted us when we opened the door to the room was unbelievable. I slept with a clean towel on my pillow to avoid the tobacco smell that permeated every inch of the room. Not going back there anytime soon."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,Mediocore 2 star hotel,Just stayed as had to catch a flight at BWI airport after a long drive. I would rate this a 2 star hotel.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,"very comfortable, greatful for the wakeup call to catch the plane!",The hotel offered all the amenities for a great experience. Every detail was met. We arrived late and left early so we were unable to do much but noted all of them. The shower head (several options) and temp of the water was great for our much appreciated arrival was awesome!
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,We were greeted with joy and happiness--felt good,No problem - complimentary breakfast was ready and waiting for us - found everything satisfactory
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,ok if nothing is available,"The ac unit was broke in the room so we were forced to open the back door and listen to the highway noise all night. Bed sheets were stained and room maintenance needed done witb broken outlets, lamp shades, etc."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Nice hotel and great value.,My son and I spent the night here and found it to be very clean and the staff to be very courteous.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,Will not stay again.,"I stayed Monday through Friday on a business trip. When I checked in, I did a quick scan of the room, there was no refrigerator or microwave. I pulled the comforter back and noticed about 7 (what appeared to be) burn holes in the sheet, right by the pillow. I was moved to another room that had a small refrigerator and microwave. The room was dirty, cobwebs in the corner by the old A/C unit. The A/C was very loud and woke me up throughout the night when it would kick in. The chair in front of the unit was stained and not all the lights/fixtures were operational. The fitness area was a mess and the equipment was broken, cups on the floor, empty water container, and towels on the floor. Typical continental breakfast, sometimes there was coffee in the morning, but not every morning."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Convenient to BWI,Park and Fly service available
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Ok but,Overall hotel was good except for breakfast it was the worst I've experienced area is way to small and choices of food on the cheap side. Also nothing is around the hotel it's by itself.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,So close,This is a nice location but poor maintenance and less than stellar housekeeping keeps it on the almost list.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,Nothing around.,"A little hard to get to, nothing in the immediate area - like within walking distance. A little old and outdated looking."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Good enough for a night or two,The hotel advertises a free breakfast but I went down to the breakfast area at 9:00 a.m. and everything was gone except for boxes of cereal and some not-very-nice looking fruit. The food area was also a mess. The rooms are not in very good repair - some mold damage along the ceiling in both the bedroom and bathroom. They have changed to cotton bed covers that can be washed rather than polyester so that's an improvement. Overall this hotel is fair.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Nice stay before BWI,The hotel was average. It's conveniently located close to bwi where they offer a shuttle service to and from the airport (that means no paying to park) hotel staff was so so. Not very friendly. The shuttle driver was cool even at 4am.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Shawn's Stay Ramada BWI,The desk clerk Jasmine was super nice and the room was comfortable. I would definitely stay there again and while the hotel is a older venue it was clean and offers free shuttle service and continental breakfast which are nice amenities as other venues don't offer these simple accommodations. There is a restaurant on-site which can be accessed within the hotel which is nice as you don't have to go outside (it rained for a couple hours - LOL). I would recommend a modification to the menu to offer more selections. I had the calamari which was okay (I've had better and the potato skins (I've had better) but they both satisfied my hunger so all good on that end. Upon check-out final bill was ready and shuttle was on time. i did forget to tip the driver which I didn't think about initially as i was focused on getting my bags checked in so this CA lady do apologize for that.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,I won't return to this hotel,"There was an old, musty smell in the room and the internet did not work. we could only pick up wifi in the hallway. These two components alone are enough to put this hotel at the bottom of my list, but what tops it off is the poor service. The front desk staff does the bare minimum to accommodate guests. It is apparent that they do not care about whether or not we have an enjoyable stay. At check in, we had a question about why our room did not have a microfridge and wanted to know what it would take to get one. The clerk that we initially spoke to was rude and gave us information that the supervisor later informed us was incorrect. The following day we went for breakfast after a morning meeting-- we got there at 930 and it ends at 930, but everything was still set up and the man at the desk was preparing waffles for himself. We went to make waffles as well and he informed us that there was no more mix and because it was 930 they would not restock. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with that policy, but having just watched him fix himself a big plate literally 30seconds earlier, it felt incredibly inconsiderate and cold. Ultimately, if you need to stay here because it is the best option for your paycheck, it may work for you, but do not expect too much in regards to customer service. On the other hand, if you can afford the extra 10-15 dollars it may cost to stay somewhere else, do yourself a favor an stay elsewhere. I am will not return to this hotel."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,They Forgot Me,"After arriving at BWI, I called the hotel for a shuttle. 45 minutes later, I called again. The shuttle had never been dispatched, so I had to wait another 20 minutes before it arrived. No apology was forthcoming. There is no business center at this hotel and the restaurant needs a major upgrade. The room, however, was well maintained and comfortable."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,Disappointed to say the least,"I called the Ramada the morning I was checking in to verify the check in time as well as verify that the room type I requested would be available, I was assured it would be. When I arrived a few hours later, the room type was unavailable. They also had a sign posted indicating the water would be off until 3:30pm. I should have received some sort of notification or gotten some sort of compensation for this considering the water was not back on until 5:45 or so. When I turned the faucet on the water was brown and disgusting - I certainly was not going to get ice or regular water from this establishment.Wi-Fi was incredibly spotty. No password, less than ZERO security. Disappointed."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,"Dated Hotel,","The room was clean and comfortable but the hotel halls etc. were messy and looked liked they werent cleaned on a regular basis. The breakfast was a joke. Three types of sugary cereal, no toast or yogurt."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Nice Overnight,Friends and I went to see a show at Ramshead Live at the casino. The Ramada was perfect for our purposes and the front desk staff were friendly and helpful when we were looking to arrange for a cab.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,"OK, for price.",No toilet paper in room upon arrival. Air did not work. Very hot in room.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Great hotel convenient to BWI,"Meet my needs for a hotel near the airport. Hotel shuttle to airport convenient, included breakfast available at 5:30 am, room was comfortable and clean. Only problem was the phone did not work and they had no staff to deal with that problem when I arrived at 1 am. The staff did agree to knock on my door in lieu of a wake-up call - which allowed me to make my early morning flight."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,the price was right,After a night of fun with work mates. It was nice just to go up to my room and not have to drive. But there was airplane noise in the morning since we are close to airport. But it wasn't too bad.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Close to airport with free shuttle service,Returning for another stay because of prior experience.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Ok,Ok has smoking rooms with a nice lounge and bar OTl.................................. ...
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Plesant Stay,"Staff at Front Desk VERY helpful and friendly and helpful with the area information,"
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Very friendly staff!,The gentleman at the front desk was so friendly and the shuttle driver treated me like a queen! They made my stay wonderful and are the main reason that I will stay again at this hotel!
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,1,terrible,not good
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Quite and pleasant. Eager staff to accommodate,Was not pleased that it rained my stay because I did not have a chance to visit the pool. The food at the grill was really good! Great turkey club and burger!! Awesome drinks......needed more alcohol but good. Shuttle from airport little slow but staff wanted to make you comfortable.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Impressed,"I got a great rate at this hotel. If I was staying in the area again, I would spend the night at this hotel. I'm sure i'll be back! This hotel gives great service and a great room."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,Not many positives other than late check out,Room had extremely Small beds and windows were single glazed backing onto busy road so very noisey all night Bins were not emptied in 3 night stay Carpets looked really stained and need replacing over all Hotel needs makeover and maintenance jobs as taps leaky and everything run down
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Rooms need some TLC,"Overall, it's not bad. Great location, especially for shopping."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,1,struck out at Ramada,I have stayed at many Ramada's over the years. This location was very run down. Carpet was soiled and dated. Had to call front desk for a TV remote and then get it ourselves. Continental breakfast was sadly lacking. Even the batter for the Waffles seemed watered down.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,1,Disaster!,"I had a late flight in so I was tired when I arrived. The staff was polite and tried hard to be accomodating however to start with the remote wold not work, so I was told to come down and get battery, this didn't work so they finally got another. The room was dirty, the sink leaked all over everytime you ran water and when trying to shower in the morning the water was only lukewarm!!"
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,Outdated Hotel,"although the staff were very accomodating, the hotel itself was old, needed renovation. lobby was gorgeous but the rooms inconsistent. hot water takes 10 - 15 minutes to come to the tap."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,3,Baltimore Airport stay.,"The room was spacious. The bed, however was hard and uncomfortable as well as the air conditioner being very noisy. The breakfast was almost nonexistant. It was nice to have a service that took you back and forth to the airport."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,Comfortable room,The room was very nice. Even had a microwave as well as fridge. Big screen tv. The only negative in my room was the toilet seat. I had to have someone come clean it and they were right on it.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Value for your money.,Better than expected for the price point. The breakfast that was provided offered many choices.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,"Not safe or clean, but comfortable.",The side door was broken and stuck open-not safe by my standards. There was plastic food storage under my bed skirt. My room was comfortable and a great breakfast started at 4am which helps for early flights.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,1,WORST... HOTEL... EVER!!!!,"Save your money- this was the worst hotel in which I have EVER stayed!!! We should have just turned around and left when we pulled into the hotel parking lot and saw a police cruiser sitting out front. The hotel stay went downhill from there. The side lot of the hotel is poorly lit and we did not feel safe parking there. There were ants in the shower, the linens were ripped, and the window had a 1/2 inch of dirt on the sill. Supplies to make a cup of coffee were in the room, but there was no coffee maker. We called the front desk to arrange for shuttle to the casino and were told it would be a 20 minute wait. After 30 minutes, we walked out to the front desk to find out how much longer it would be. The staff informed us that they had forgotten to put us on the list for the shuttle... we would have been waiting forever!! I plugged my cellphone in to charge overnight, and awoke to find that it had not charged at all... the outlet had no power supply."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,2,Hotel near BWI airport,Parking lot not cleared of snow. Paths and road very slippery with no salt applied. Front desk not helpful. No hot water for shower in morning. Other guests had same issue. Front desk said there is no hot water problem and then told it is an old boiler which has issues.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,4,Nice hotel and great location,The hotel was clean and quiet. It is close to BWI has a restaurant/bar and I would stay there again.
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,1,Giant Disappointment,"We stayed here for 2 nights, and we chose this hotel based on the reviews we read on hotels.com. Unfortunately, the hotel was not what I expected. It was not clean, and was very run-down and dated. The front desk staff members were not pleasant, and one of them was downright rude. Their free breakfast was definitely a disappointment, as it was lacking in quality. I suppose since it was free, there's not much that I can complain about. The food was tasteless, there wasn't enough on hand for all of the guests (except for the cereal) and the breakfast area was very dirty. I would not stay at this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else."
Ramada BWI Airport/Arundel Mills,5,SUPER economical hotel!,All new renovated hotel!! Great prices. Excellent staff!! A little tough to get to on the back roads but well worth it!
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",1,"Dirty, overpriced",Pigsty. Room wasn't cleaned they claimed to only have smoking rooms available. Rowdy drunks till 3am.
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",1,Did not like,"We did not like this hotel. We left after one night. It was January in DC, (cold) and the heater did not work in the room. We called the person at the front desk but there was no one available to help with this. We called the front desk again for extra blankets which they did bring. We had booked a room with two beds and were very specific about this when calling for the reservation. When we got to the hotel there was only one bed in the room and no one could help us as the front desk was closed, only someone there to had out keys for late arrivals."
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",2,Okay,Location is great for Metro boarding to DC. No one at the front desk at check-in or check-out. Hallways/stairwells do not smell good at all. Exercise room has no sweat towels or sanitizer towels which we have never seen before. Room was slightly dirty upon arrival. No room service during the stay. Had to ask for extra towels and toilet... More
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",3,Okay room for the price,"The air conditioner in my room was very noisy, kept me up, had to trun it off and open windows. That let in the light and street noise (which was quieter than air condioner). Bathtub drain plug was broken so I had to tak a shower whch I don't like to do. No shampoo or conditioner."
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",1,Avoid at all costs,"I really hope someone in the hotel groups management reads this. I will give a little background on the situation. The first part is completely out of the hotels control and I don't blame them for any of it, but their part in what happened to me and my mother last night is frankly disgusting. My dad passed away quite... More"
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",2,It's so so,"The hotel is OK ,the guy on the front desk was very nice ,the rooms are OK BUT in the morning I had a few bed bug bites and there is no continental breakfast just protein bars . On top of that upon check out I ask the lady at the front desk for a receipt and she told me she can't give me one cuz I book the room over the Internet but when I checked in I signed a paper with the amount and just wanted a copy of that page but she refused to give me cuz it was for the hotel use only ... So ridiculous . She wasn't on a mood or something but very rude so if you can find another hotel go there ..."
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",5,Wonderful hotel and staff,"Pool, elevator, laundry room It has everything I needed, any questions the staff had beyond taken care of me, such hospitality that makes you feel at home when you're away. Dominique and Nounie are incredible managers and have a wonderful crew. Thank you all."
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",3,Room for employee working in area,Perfect location for employee during job.
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",2,No ice machine. Need update bedding Blankets,Pillows are uncomfortable Spotted babies cockroaches in kitten. No utensils. So prepare to bring things you need.
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",4,good hotel,"the hotel is close to subway station, the room is large,the service is good. the hotel can free park, so it is easy for people to come there, the hotel's free breakfirst is ok,and the hotel's wifi is good"
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",5,"Perfect location, great price and very nice staff","This extended stay accommodation is perfect. The location of the hotel will take you to any point in the DC Metropolitan The greatest thing in this hotel is the staff lead by Ms. Julia Hanson-Takyi, General Manager. Julia is very helpful person. She is outstanding in serving the customers. She always doing her best to make the stay comfortable and... More"
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!! GO ELSEWHERE!!,"I have been coming to the DC area on business for the past 6 months and will continue to do so for another 6 months. I usually stay at the Homewood Suites in Springfield, however, they were completely booked for this last stay. This is the first ... and last ... time I will stay at Extended Stay America in Springfield. The hotel literally STINKS!! The lobby, the elevator and our room had various smells of smoke, body odor, curry and feet!! Daily housekeeping service is only available if you stay for a week ... unless you want to pay 15/day for it. The towels are hard, scratchy and very thin ... and the toilet paper is the same. In our full kitchen, we had 1 fork and 3 spoons. The coffee maker was on it's last leg ... and we only had 1 packet of coffee with ancient creamer whose powder was so hard it didn't even melt in the coffee. The continental breakfast was 3 thermos of coffee, a basket of apples, and stale muffins and is located on a table right next to the front door, which caused a traffic jam with people trying to get in/out of the hotel in the morning. On a positive note, the hotel staff was pleasant, the bed was nice and the location is good. Otherwise, this hotel is definitely not worth the money!!"
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",2,Not a good stay!,The room was dirty it was hair everywhere the counter and table was sticky the shower made a really loud noise when you turn it on just not a good experience
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",5,Family gathering,Cleanliness of the hotel was spot on. The staff at check in was very helpful. The room was very large and could accommodate my family with comfort and ease. A great stay and a great value.
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",4,Great deal for double room with kitchenette,I originally booked a queen room but was surprised to see there were two double beds was no issue at all given the extra bed was good for space and to add I wasn't expecting a kitchenette in the room. Could have been some more toiletries and maybe cook ware and silverware but good to know next time what to bring. Front desk staff very cool and even with us waking up late and checking out a half hour after the set time there was no issue at all no one bothers about it given we did check in late. Very appreciated.
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",3,Good place to stay while working,"Room was clean and efficient. The efficiency apartment layout was nice. Only critique was the faucet on the bathtub dripped, but i just closed the door and it did not bother me. I was too tired at the end of the workday to bother calling in maintenance. Breakfast is sparse, coffee, instant oatmeal, packaged muffins and some fruit."
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",3,Not impressed!,"Entire hotel smelled like an ashtray. The garbage can in the room was full from the previous occupant and no TP in the room. Other than that, it was just ok."
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Springfield",4,we had a very comfortable stay,"Close to metro, 15-20 min walk was pleasant."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,nice hotel. close to beach.,nice hotel. super friendly staff. close to beach. great breakfast. nice pool and game room. perfect for families. great value.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,I like it !!!,"The hotel location is good, the employees very nice and polite, although my room was in the middle there was no noise. My only disappoinment was the parking lot, not too many at front."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Nice hotel with a nice view,Hotel was great! breakfast was good and the staff we're very nice
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,"Good, but not as good as Id like","Clean, but bed was very uncomfortable. They forgot to put a shower curtin on our shower so I had to call management in the morning to get it put on. Heater didnt put out very hot heat. Bed was bad, woke up with back pain."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Very nice hotel with beautiful oceanfront view,The staff was amazing and helpful. Very clean and quiet. Room was beautiful. Will highly recommend to anyone.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Never use Hotels.com again!!!!!!!!!!!,It was a great stay the only problem is that Hotels.com booked and charged me for two rooms. I only reserved one room. I am still waiting for Hotels.com to acknowledge their mistake and refund my account.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,Work week,"Stay was good though parking a work vehicle is not practical. Main parking tight and deck is 7 max height, thought better height than others on beach."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,2,Overrated and obsolete in 2016.,The room smelled of old smoke and room freshener!!! Bare essentials for the stay... remote setting from the main building with parking unavailable nearby. Scary and totally disappointing!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,52 SECOND ANNIVESARY,IT WAS OUR MARRIAGE ANNIVERSARY 52ND WHEN THE MANGER HEARD THAT THEY GAVE US A FREE ROOM UPGRADE.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,Comfortable but noisy,It fine except they were partying until the wee hours in the morning
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,2,Not what I would expect from a Best Western,The hotel is listed as 'ocean front' but there 2 buildings. The second building is across the street from the ocean. That wouldn't be so bad but our room faced out on the old rusting parking structure. You could touch the rusting girders from our door. It was very unpleasant - I wouldn't stay here again. Not at all the standard I would expect from Best Western.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Tim and everybody at desk was great!,"Excellent service, great staff , I like the complimentary breakfast"
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,okay hotel close to beach,"Our experiences with the staff at the hotel were great, everyone was very friendly. The room itself was okay. Nothing very exciting, but it had what we needed. It felt a bit worn out. There was a crack in the shower wall. The safe in the room was quite hard to open because the lock itself was worn. The door to the balcony was hard to lock unlock for the same reason, the AC was very loud, but it did keep us nice cool. The pillows on the bed were strange, instead of your normal sized pillows they were all about the size of a couch throw pillow (about 4-5 on a bed) they were very thick roundish. Too hard on the neck! The location was terrific though it was nice to have a free breakfast every morning. The breakfast bar included juices, tea, coffee milk. There was cereal, French toast, grits, sausage, eggs, pastries, fruit, yogurt, toast, English muffins, etc. You won't go away hungry:) The indoor pool was like a sauna. A bit too warm for us. The outdoor pool is very nice just across the room. There is parking right in front of the hotel or across the street in back of the outdoor pool. It is in walking distance of shops restaurants. It's also about an hour away from Busch Gardens. There is a great ice cream place right across from the hotel called 'Sweet Frog'. Awesome, but a bit on the expensive side. A great treat though. The best thing is the beach so it is well worth it to get an Oceanside balcony."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,Business and fun,Room was across street from ocean. It's confusing so be careful when you book. I booked non ocean view but didn't think that meant I had to cross street. I think there are some non ocean view rooms on the side of ocean but not sure. It wasn't a big deal though as it was a small walk.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Enjoyable teip,Was a good time. Housekeeping missed us one day but we're quick to come when we called about it.would stay again
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,Vacation,The rooms need some updating. The bathroom was very small and the exhaust fan was very loud in the bathroom.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,Beautiful room and a great view,Great room for the price. The Breakfast was awesome
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,Good location/outdoor pool,"The only complaints that I have is that the indoor pool was out of service for a day and half which wasn't good for the kids. Our balcony door stuck really, really bad! The light in the bathroom is also the fan so you can't be in there without the fan going. Hard to hear what is going on in the room with the loud noise running all the time."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Clean and right on the beach!,The room was a little small but was right on the beach with a large balcony. It had a fridge and a microwave. The non oceanfront rooms are across the street as is the outdoor pool and additional parking. The free breakfast was good and open until 10:00. Everything was clean!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,2,Good location,Came for a sporting event. Hotel is old and dated but clean. They are in the middle of renovating it.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,our stay was great!!!!!!,when we checked in the desk clerks were very very nice and helpful the rooms were very clean and i had requested a room no higher than 3rd floor and they very nicely accomodated my request the pool was wonderful and the buffet breakfast was awesome the food was hot and delicious i will definitely stay at this motel again on my future visits to va beach
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,2,Not a 3 star!,"Beware when you book online! They show you pictures of main building and facilities. I booked the room fully aware that it is not a oceanfront room and booked a 'west side' and 'room with a view'. It never mentioned anywhere in the description that west side means across the street in a inn like property, completely separate from main building. Room was not good either, with a tiny bath, more like 2 star. And as for 'room with a view', I got a 'nice' view of steps and parking garage 5 feet away from door. Talking to hotel staff was not helpful either as they offered to 'upgrade' me to oceanfront room for an additional 50/ night. The hotel should not be allowed to advertise those rooms as 3 star and put clearly in description what the west side means. Never again!"
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,pleasant stay,My family had a very nice stay. super location everything right out the door. Breakfast could not be better and free.very friendly staff all and all a great place to stay.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,"Great location, view and beach access but...","Great location, views, ammenities but hotel was not clean, older hotel, room small, elevator slow, staff not that friendly, tv didnt work till we got it fixed, AC did not work well."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,Good location on the beach.,Decent hotel. Not dirty. Simple. Good part of strip.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,Ok,Great
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Great off-season place to stay,"The staff was very friendly, the room was clean and a decent size for VA Beach. It was off-season, but everything was still fine. I think they are renovating the other side of the building, but our side was business as usual. The heated pool was a bonus!"
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,Great hotel on the beach,"This hotel is in a beautiful location. Staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Eli at the front desk. Rooms were spacious qns clean with balcony looking over beach and ocean. Will definitely be booking there on my next trip to virginia beach."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,Winter break stay,"Very nice stay. The rooms were a little small, but very comfortable."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,2,Unexpected disappointment.,"BW has an annex! It's on the far side of the street. We had a roach and a broken air conditioner the first day. Had to repack and move to another room! On the third day in 103 degrees the elevator broke. We're 75 and our new room was on the third floor! All outside surfaces are covered w tar rather than repaving. It's pealing and looks very shabby. Only four umbrellas at the outdoor pool for over 100 guests! We had stayed in the main bldg. before, and were very disappointed to be across the street."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,"Nice location, needs better rooms.","Staff is friendly and helpful.great location, not enough parking. Parking garage is really tight for large vehicles. Heated indoor pool was cold. Beds are small, not very comfortable, pillows are terrible. Food in the restaurant is good but continental breakfast wasnt good at all."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,AVERAGE HOTEL ON BEACH!,"Hands down definitely the worst Best Western I've stayed!!! Don't know if previous people or cleaning person left balcony door open But the room had at least 5 mosquitoes buzzing around, fortunately I managed to get 3. A slight musty odor like a old wet towel throughout room. Luckily we only stayed 1 night if it weren't for the ocean view we would have literately fought for money back! So if your on a budget this is it!!!"
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,Not so bad,"It was not bad, my room was beside the pool and a lot if noise,short stay would be ok."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,On the beach but outside pool a cross street,Wanted to stay an extra night saw cheaper price online. Operated I called from room at front desk was not overly helpful in making sure I got the best price so we checked out instead
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,2,Old building.,It needs to be renovated.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,Very Pleased.,Breafast was awesome. Only complaint was how small the bathroom was. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept on. My sister in law and her husband had room beside us and they said the same thing about the bed. Would love to have that bed just wish I had looked to see what brand the bed was. Everyone was very nice to us. Had an issue with the bill at checkout but they promptly took care of it. Thank You Best Western for a wonderful 8 day stay.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,2,Good location but small rooms for family,Hotel outdoor pool looked much larger on the website and appeared to be oceanfront. The rooms were somewhat smaller and from the orbitz website it looked like the room would be separated into 2 areas - 1 bedroom 1 TV/dining area w/couch. Apparently those rooms are only available across the street from the ocean.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Had a great stay!,Great room. Very clean and comfortable! Great ocean view!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,good value,Relaxing stress free.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,Oceanfront room,"Stayed from Monday thru Friday and the last couple days were not very pleasant. Staff is very friendly and I always felt welcomed! Thursday house keeping was awful. I asked for clean bathroom towels everyday and they gave me dirty bathroom towels! They also gave me a dirty pillow case! Had to call the front desk two times. Was told I had to wait to get new clean bathroom towels and pillow cases because they were in the washer. This was at 5pm in the afternoon. Thankfully, Alex who works at the front desk was very nice and brought up new towels and pillow cases. He was also very apologetic. Friday my beds were not fixed and house keeping just dropped the towels off without doing anything in the hotel room."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,"Nice hotel, right on the Oceanfront","We made plans last minute so we were worried if this place would be nice. We were very happy with our experience! We were 1 hour early for check-in but the staff said it was okay. Check in was quick and fast. We parked across the street at the garage. Rooms were clean, we had requested top floor which they accommodated! View was PERFECT! Exactly what we wanted! Rooms are a bit dated like the carpet and the bathroom but very clean and plenty of towels. Room had a flat screen TV which we never even turned on because there was so much to do! Free hot breakfast was great the next morning. The staff is EXCEPTIONAL! Very friendly, they always smile. Very efficient! Every time we needed something, they went out of their way to meet our needs. I will definitely visit again just because of the family friendly atmosphere and the super attentive staff!"
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,On the beach,"This Best Western is located on the beach. Some cons are: the parking in front of the hotel is quite tight and spaces limited and the pool is located across the street (there is also a parking garage across the street.) This hotel is located where you can walk to some restaurants and beach shops but it's also a bit away from the heart of things as well. The free continental breakfast was adequate, had hot cold choices, a couple fruit juices, coffee, milk and some fresh apples and oranges to offer. The hotel staff was amazingly nice and accommodating, going above and beyond --in my opinion. This isn't the newest of hotels with aging decor and a semi-cold fridge in my room, but the price and location were perfect for this trip!"
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,Overall nice stay.,Great location oceanfront on Boardwalk. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room just need some updating and wasn't exactly clean. It just needs a more through cleaning than the everyday housekeeping and I think it would be back on track. This was our 3rd year staying here and will probably come again next year!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,Best Western Stay,Made trip in late December. Very satisfied with overall experience. Room and service were pretty good. Easy to connect Wifi. Parking is nearby. Oceanfront room with nice views. Is nearby to attractions.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Quick getaway,I enjoyed our stay at Best Weatern Plus oceanfront!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,Wonderful stay!,Enjoyed my whole stay! The only complaint I have is that they did not keep toiletries stocked as well as they did in the past when I have stayed! I love the indoor and outdoor pool and the staff members were all friendly!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Excellent location,"Really nice room...comfortable king bed, great ocean view from balcony on 5th floor. Bathroom was little tight to go in shut door. Love the afternoonsunshine coming in through glassed-in hallway leading to rooms. Access to boardwalk beach was quick easy. The breakfast was way more than continental delish. Price was decent since it was off-season, that's when we choose to stay overnight most anywhere. We would def stay there again!"
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,thumbs up,Nice
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,Great location for Funkfest,"Hotel is nice, clean....bathroom vent was extremely loud annoying and patio door was very hard to open and unlock. But overall, stay was good!"
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,2,"Best Western, Virginia Beach",Business as usual. Nothing special about this hotel except its location. It needs a major facelift.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,Great for the money,"Beds were a little uncomfortable, but they made up for it with lots of pillows. Woke up with a crick in my neck each of the first two nights, but resolved it by taking the pillows from the other bed and creating my own pillow-top mattress. Problem solved."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,4,Great Holiday,"We had a terrific view of the ocean and beach. The room was big, the beds and pillows was comfortable. The only problem was the fan in the shower/toilet room was extremely noisy, the toilet was too close to the toilet paper dispenser and there wasn't enough counter space for our toiletry items. We had to leave most things in our toiletry bags and use the items from them. Otherwise, the room was great and it was nice to hear the roar of the ocean every night. All staff was very friendly however we were told that there would be a concierge who would sell us tickets for the whale cruise but we never saw a concierge for the 2 days that we were there. We went directly to the cruise ticket office instead. We will probably stay there again if we go back to Virginia Beach."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,2,Hotel description was deceiving.,I was not expecting a room with outside access. I would not have stayed there if I had know what to expect. The description listed the room as not ocean front. It should have stated it was in a separate building and that it was motel style. Air conditioner was located directly below the thermostat and there was one air conditioner and thermostat for both rooms sections in the suite. Could not maintain a comfortable temperature.
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Enjoyable stay in Virginia Beach,"Very convenient, good breakfast, plenty of parking. Would definitely stay there again."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Nice overnight stay for business,"Over night stay on business room was in good shape a lot of newness and clean Breakfast was ok, could use a waffle machine, some food in buffet could be fresher."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Oceanfront room for Jimmy Buffett concert!,"A coworker I went to see the Jimmy Buffett concert. Just stayed the night but had a gorgeous oceanfront room. Hotel was pretty full but quiet. Free HOT continental breakfast was good, lots of choices. Would definitely stay again, especially when the weather is warmer not so windy!!"
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Great place,loved the customer service. Kudos to Dawn for making our anniversary extra special in the oceanfront room. Great placed within easy walking distance of Catch 31 and Sushi. Will definitely stay here again!!
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,3,Decent oceanfront room for a short weekend stay...,"Hotel room was nice. My only complaints was no extra bedding readily available in rooms closet, as I am used to at other hotels and the restaurant inside of hotel was over priced for the limited amount of food options it had."
Best Western Plus Virginia Beach,5,Great hotel on the beach.,The hotel was great! The check in/out was quick and simple. The employees at every level were very courteous. The restaurant in the hotel had great food. Rooms were very clean and had a great view of the ocean. The amenities were great. The hotel was located near great shopping and seafood restaurants. I will stay here again for all of my future vacations to Virginia Beach.
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,5,Very nice stay,"Perfect location. Very nice rooms. Great included breakfast. Very helpful, competent, and friendly staff. Will visit again."
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,4,Comfort Inn - Virginia Beach,"This was a great hotel, great location!!! Check-in was quick, check-out was even faster! The room was just as pictured, beautiful ocean view from the balcony. The one and only issue we had was no hot water on two occasions. We will definitely stay again when we return to Virginia Beach!!!"
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,4,A great view can trump a few problems.,"Looking out over the ocean from your balcony window trumps (almost) any negatives. The rooms are showing their age but are maintained as well as can be expected. If you walk outside the hotel, at night, expect to meet some fairly odd/unusual people. ...Oh and there's a USN base nearby and F-18's scream overhead every 5 mins. lol"
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,5,Outstanding!,"This hotel was absolutely wonderful. I was a little leary at first but I was happily surprised when I walked into the lobby. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful....except for the concierge the evening we arrived. He was super annoying and kept bugging us to talk to him for ideas of things to do. Our room was spacious and clean. Our room was broken into two areas...a bedroom and a living room, both of which had tvs. We were extremely pleased with our stay and would highly recommend this hotel."
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,5,Our night out,"Wife and I wanted to stay in a hotel on the beach with smoking accomodations inside the room. We found this hotel to not only be comfortable, but very very clean and spacious. It reminded us of our stay in the residence inn in California. Would definately recommend to others in this location."
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,5,best value,It was awesome they were friendly and the cleaning was above and beyond. Friendly personel exelent location. Exeptional overall value. I'll be back!!!!
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,5,Family first,Loved it
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,5,Just a little get away,Very easy to find. Close to beach and activities. Great breakfast. Would return again. Beach nice and clean.
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,5,Excellent!,"This hotel was really great! I had read many reviews of hotels in the area before booking, and this one was a winner in most categories and I can see why! The room was excellent, very clean, very modern, very nice. The only reason I went down on the comfort was that I found the bed to be a little hard for my liking, but I have back issues, so that could be why. The staff was amazing. I ended up becoming very ill, and they were very accommodating and empathetic, and that was greatly appreciated. The breakfast was excellent, a good spread with many options. The pool and hot tub were nice, especially in the evening. The location is directly on the beach, and the balconies allow for a fantastic view (even when you are lying ill on the couch!). I would most definitely stay here again, and it was an excellent price, making it that much better!"
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,5,Quiet off-season business stay,"Quiet and peaceful surrounding neighborhood during off season, friendly staff, clean spacious rooms and balcony with view of the beach."
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,5,Pretty nice hotel overall.,"Hotel is right off of the main highway into VA Beach, so it's very quick to get in and out. It is right by the boardwalk as well, within walking distance of the pier. So overall, I love the location! The room is small and divided into two section--living area (with pull out couch or another queen bed depending on room selection), and bedroom. I did not like the bedroom being by the hallway, the wall isn't thin but you can still hear people at night. The bathroom is nicely renovated recently, which was a big plus. Wife and kids loved the balcony facing the ocean, we enjoyed watching the beach at dusk. Overall, we had a very pleasant 3 nights stay at this Comfort Inn and will definitely book it for next year's trip back to VA Beach."
Comfort Inn Suites Virginia Beach Oceanfront,2,Nice hotel. NO!,"Ask for disabled room on bottom floor. Booked through expedia,never again. Put on 2nd floor, only 1 of the elevators went to 2nd.told by staff to send other elevator to top floor so we could get the correct one to open. Ice machine not on our floor. Rooms were old and smelled musty."
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,5,Near the coliseum - Right side of the street,"The hotel is strategically located near the Coliseum. It is surrounded by lots of food, shopping, post office, banking, etc. It is also very easy to get to Langley AFB, 64, etc. There seemed to be a lot of late night activity on the main drive, but very little of that spilled back to this hotel. It is a great alternative to trying to secure a short term lease, but it is like living on your own. The weekly housekeeping is good, but it is only weekly."
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,1,Customer Service,"The room was not tidy, the customer service was horrible!!!! We could not stay the second night. Had to leave because the hotel service and cleanliness, and no hot water!!!!!!!!!!!"
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,2,THE BREAKFAST WAS A JOKE. GRAB AND GO,"THE WORST BREAKFAST OF ANY HOTEL I'VE EVER STAYED AT. WE HAD TO GO OUT EVERY MORNING FOR BREAKFAST. ROOM HAD DOG FOOD PELLETS ON THE FLOOR. POOR CLEANING OF ROOM. THE VOLUME CONTROL OF THE TV DIDN'T WORK. THE HALL WAY TO OUR ROOM WAS EXTREMELY COLD. I WILL NEVER STAY AT AN EXTENDED STAY HOTEL EVER AGAIN. ALSO, NO POOL."
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,2,Not good.,Terrible. Weak wifi. Room wasn't ready until 7pm. Short staffed I guess. TV had a big scratch in it. Iron was broken.
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,1,Meh,"There weren't enough towels and washcloths placed in the room before our arrival. When I asked for two more, they only had one washcloth the other washcloths and towels had yet to be washed. They didn't have food available for the Grab Go Breakfast initially, but the manager pulled something together eventually. The staff is very nice, however, and the hotel is very convenient to dining, shopping, and touring."
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,4,Nice close to Hampton Coliseum,"Staff made our stay nice when making the reservation with told him that handcap.was needed didn't get that from them, but when got to hotel ,the staff made it for us"
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,1,"Good location, hotel needs to be updated","We requested 4 non smoking rooms. When we checked in we only had 2 non smoking and the hotel was sold out. My of thr rooms we had to kill a roach. Another room I was personally bite up from some type of black bug. They treated my room and offered to move me to there other location which was an inconvenience. The carpet in all of our rooms was dirty and mine was dirty and torn. One of the rooms had a 90 dollar charge under Other which the hotel could not explain so they removed it. And when they were checking my bed to see what was biting me, it was particulars on the box spring that did not belong to me. So how was that possible if they had put on new linen prior to me coming. I would not recommend this hotel nor would I return. They did give me two night comp stay for another location for my troubles but I dont beleive it was enough."
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,4,Convenient and Close to 64,"We only stayed one night, but we can see why it would be good for an extended stay. The room had a small kitchen and work area. We prefer to stay at hotels that offer a full breakfast, which this one didn't but that was okay, we just went to the Waffle House down the street. This is not a complaint by the way. We were mainly looking for a hotel close to Interstate 64 for one night and the lack of a full breakfast was not a big deal to us. The staff were friendly and courteous and the room was clean and adequate for our needs. We would stay here again if we are ever in the area."
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,4,Perfectly fine for a budget hotel,"I chose this hotel because the room had a kitchen, it was inexpensive, and it was close to the Hampton Convention Center (about 1/3 mile). The room was comfortable and clean, although the armchair, carpet, and bedspread needed to be spot-cleaned. There was a problem with my air conditioning unit which was fixed relatively quickly, even though it was a weekend. The staff was friendly."
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,5,nice for just to get away from home for a weekend,me and my girlfriend was just looking for a random hotel to stay in since she live in north carolina i stay in virginia came across this for a gud price booked it enjoyed our little weekend together loved the kitchen and the water n the shower wasnt cold had no problem that wasnt fixable it was a nice comfortable stay
Extended Stay America Hampton - Coliseum,4,Average Place-3 Stars,"Very friendly staff...accomdating and hospitable. Room was decent, but hotel does allow pets and we had 3 yipping dogs across the hall. They did not disturb our sleep, however they barked whenever they heard us going in and out of the room or talking loud in our room."
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,4,Power outage in my area so it was a quick getaway.,We had a power outage and had to think quickly. I went online and saw this hotel. The staff was great. The young man was training someone when we walked in but made us feel very welcomed.
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,4,Nice hotel.,Bed was very comfortable. Rooms were very clean. And the staff was very helpful.
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,5,Family reunion for Mother's 89th Birthday.,"From booking reservations out of state to check in to breakfast, the reception we experienced by the staff was heart warming and genuine. Hampton Inn went beyond any expectations we had during our stay."
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,4,Good value for your money.,"Clean, comfortable and complimentary breakfast. Staff was very good and no surprises. I would definitely stay at this hotel again."
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,5,Great hotel for price,"Perfect location to get to merriweather, tons of food options across the street. Staff was helpful."
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,4,Alright hotel,The room was nice. Didn't care much for the set up though. My kids slept on a sofa bed while I slept on the King. We couldn't watch the tv. You had to swivel it one way or another. There was a long table that divided the room from sitting to bed. The pool was small and very cold. Definitely not heated!
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,4,Beautiful place to stay.,The location is great and the rooms are very spacious and very comfortable. I will recommend this to anyone.
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,5,"Hampton Inn in Columbia, MD","We stay at this hotel every time we come to Columbia. It has a great location, great service and overall just a nice place to stay."
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,5,Great Place,"Great Room, Great Staff!! Would recommend to anyone staying in that area."
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,5,very nice hotel,"all new amenities and great free breakfast, quiet location, very clean, very nice and friendly staff, definitely will stay there again!"
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,5,Fantastique sejour:,"Nous avons eu un superbe sejour ! La decoration, la proprete, le dejeuner la piscine, tout y etait pour faire plaisir a une jeune famille en transit."
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,4,Nice hotel good food but the bed was hard,Staff was very friendly and accommodating . We would stay again
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,5,Wifi in the room,Great. The only problem was the WiFi connection.
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,4,My stay was enjoyable,"I stayed for two nights (Saturday and Sunday) for concerts at Merriweather Post Pavillion. Due to the extreme volume of people checking in at the front desk upon my arrival, I was given a key to a room that was already occupied. The front desk staff apologized for their error and corrected the issue promptly. The rest of the stay was comfortable, quiet, and relaxing."
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,4,Nice stay,"The hotel was very clean and front desk service was fast and friendly. The room was a bit small with only one chair. The free breakfast was good but the plastic silverware and styrofoam plates was a bit tacky. However, I did get a great rate so I was definitely satisfied and would stay here again when needed."
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,4,"Good, would stay again.",The room was very clean and spacious. Wish the pillows were Fuller and fluffy.
Hampton Inn Suites Columbia/South,5,Highly recommend this beautiful Hampton Inn,"Great location and a very friendly, helpful staff. Immaculate room and hotel with all the amenities one could ask for. The morning breakfast changed its entree every morning and the coffee was delicious and available all day. The housekeeping staff is very thorough and the room was beautiful. I would highly recommend this Hampton Inn to anyone looking for location and an extremely clean and well appointed place to stay at a very affordable price. This will be our go to hotel whenever we visit family in Maryland."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Ok for one nights stay...,Floors in lobby need to be cleaned and waxed no AC in the elevator or hallways transient lady asked me for money in the lobby!
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,I'll Stay Again,I stayed 4 nights while attending a conference elsewhere in the D.C. area. I was looking for reasonable price in the D.C. area and proximity to the Metro. The hotel met both needs. They provided a complimentary shuttle to the Metro (although I chose the 20 minute one time just for exercise). There were several good restaurants nearby. I enjoyed the fish restaurant nearby very much. I also chose fast food one night -- all within walking distance. I plan to stay there on a subsequent visit. I enjoyed the complimentary eggs and sausage each morning. (They had cereal also.) They are a little weak on facility maintenance but the room I had was fine.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Ok stay,"Comfortable room, continental breakfast was terrible though."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Okay for one night,We just stayed one night but my boyfriend said there was an odor when he first went in. It wasn't a bad hotel. It just needs to updating.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Water stains is a no go.,"It was a bad experience for me. The first room I checked into the ceilings had water stains, the shower walls were dirty and the final straw was when I pulled back the covers and what do I see, a caterpillar crawling in my bed. I was so disgusted when I saw that and when I called the front desk they told me I had to come down to switch rooms because they had one person on duty. So they put me in another room and there that had water stains in the ceiling and the toilet seat had stains on it and the room door had water stains on it. It was 1 in the morning and I was exhausted so I stayed that night but when I woke up I had bites all over my back so with that I checked out early and went to another hotel."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Nice hotel but difficult,"Nice hotel but difficult to walk to restaurants. Only Red Lobster, McDonalds Wendy's in area that were known. Staff was very helpful rooms were clean."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Awesome Hotel!,LOVED IT!!!
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Great value,"The looby of the area was very busy. Only one clerk at desk. Took awhile to check-in. However, the room was nice. The bed comfortable. Nice restaurants in walking distance. I would stay there again."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Not A Bad Stay,"Overall it was pretty good...the staff were excellent..the free breakfast was GREAT. However, the shower didn't produce cold water until the 3rd person took a shower. Also, we didn't have a refridgerator in the room, so left overs from resturants were out of the question. But loved to have the ability to take a shuttle to the Metro Station, that then took me the DC so I didn't have to drive for a tour of DC. GREAT!!!"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Weekend stay,"It was great had a reasonable breakfast,could improve on breakfast menus!"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Great Hotel Service - Convenient to Metro,We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff the shuttle service was fantastic! Only a couple of minutes away from a Metro Station the hotel provides regular service to/from every 30 minutes or on demand. Very nice buffet breakfast. Hotel room was clean very comfortable. We will definitely be back.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,the perfect staycation,I have always loves this hotel. Besides being close to the highway for easy assess to all the areas attractions. It is tucked away for peace of mind.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Not for the business traveler,"This is a very nice property for tourists, but business travelers should look elsewhere. The internet service is very poor. So, if you have to work in your room at night and require internet access, this will not be a good choice for you. Also, I have never been to a hotel that does not get NBC on the TV - one of the major networks. I was going to inform the management of my concerns, but when I checked out, no one asked me how was your stay, so I didn't bother."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Car a benefit in this location,"The shuttle to the station wasn't always as available as implied, however it was quite an easy walk. If you have a UK mobile calling for the shuttle for a return trip from the station could be a problem but there were pay phones available. When we first went to our allocated room we were disappointed to have a brick wall just a few feet from the window. Upon request we were immediately moved to another room. The two minor problems we had with the room (safe and iron) were rectified quickly. In view of other comments we found the breakfast to be really disappointing and eventually decided to eat elsewhere. A car for a week is cheaper than a taxi to and from Dulles airport."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Custo beneficio bom,"Hotel confortavel, porem com algumas instalacoes antigas. No lobby e corredores muito bem arrumado, porem ao entrar no quarto sentimos um cheiro desagradavel. Me pareceu filtro do ar condicionado sujo. O banheiro estava limpo, assim como as toalhas e lencois. Em fim, para a regiao de washington, bom custo beneficio."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,1,Had potential,"I stayed here with my family and the facility is outdated, the entrance smelled horrible. They didn't have an HDMI port for the tv, no extra comforters, the beds were a little uncomfortable"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,1,Worst hotel,Please look at Google reviews for TRUE REVIEW!
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Disappointed with the Service,"The Hotel itself is nice and fairly clean. However, booked the hotel months ago and when we arrived, which was late and after 12am, we were told that our twin room was not available, they had sold it, and we could have a double room with 1 bed. They were going to put up a portable bed, but took them a while to find it. We were offered to go to other hotel, but they were fully booked too. The hotel changed the room the following night, but no compensation, apart from a free drink which we had to fight for as well, were offered."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Ideale per visitare Washington!,"Ideale per visitare Washington, la zona e gradevole e ci sono dei ristorantini, nonche fast food, per cenare di sera. L'hotel e dotato di tutti i confort, wifi, frigo in camera, noi lo abbiamo caricato di acqua presa in un supermercato vicino. Una bella sorpresa!!!"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Child free night,I really enjoyed myself. Wish they offered more discounts
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Nice hotel at. a great price.,This is the 2nd time we stay at this hotel. Everyone is friendly and the rooms are very comfortable. The shuttle driver is very nice and he's always on time. Great breakfast and service. We would definitely stay there everytime we would visit DC.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,good rooms with affordable price,This is a hotel with good rooms and nice staff. The location relative to the DC downtown is not the best but the hotel offers very good shuttle service to a metro station. I highly recommend this hotel.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Mixed Results,"This hotel is exceptionally priced for what it offers (e.g. complimentary breakfast, well equiped fitness center, wireless internet), but the price is due to its terrible location and accessibility. Very friendly staff too, but getting there safely is the challenge."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,very nice....great staff!,Stayed here overnight to go to fedex field. Very close to metro and the hotel will take you to and pi k you up from the metro station. Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms nice and clean. All we needed or our two night stay. Area directly surrounding hotel a little hard to navigate and not a lot of choices. Couple of nice eateries within 5 min walk.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Nice Find!,"Staff was very friendly and helpful. Hotel was extremely clean and well laid out. Room was very spacious. Could use a little more lighting in the room. In a nice area and very close to University of Maryland, College Park."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Good location,"Very good location, close to metro and a supermarket. Lots of restaurants surrounding. Free breakfast has plenty of hot foods. Free wifi is quite slow. Overall the hotel is good, price also good. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,TOTALMENTE RECOMENDADO,"Muy agradable, excelente atencion del senor SAM, conductor del SHUTTLE"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Hot smell,I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. The room was small and had a smell that cannot be described. The breakfast that is included is not the greatest.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,"Business Hotel, Not for family-environment hotel",I spent two nights at the Metro Points Hotel. The Hotel Guests was somewhat in some of term is seemed to be helpful. The reasons I took points off because Breakfast Foods were awful. The chef used pre-packages on most of the buffet foods. The hospitality of the service was very negative. 10 charged for using microwaves is ridiculous! There is no another way to heating up my foods from take-out place. Not the best family hotel to book it. Probably more for last minute business trip. .
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Friendly hotel,"Hotel was in great and new condition, staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was great too!"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Fed Ex Field,Perfect for getting to the game.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,"Comoda. tranquila,","Como otras veces en este hotel. Tranquila y comoda, a pesar de la lejania y largo viaje en metro. Caminar desde la ultima estacion de metro hasta el hotel, se hace agradable y cerca de alli hay lugares para comer. Si no te gusta caminar, tienen shuttle bus y vas y vienes en el. Diversidad de opciones de comida. El precio es una buena razon para esto. Es barato a pesar de la temporada."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Go Eagles,"We stayed here one night due to travel for an Eagles game. For the money,not a bad deal."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Ok stay,"The housekeepers were so loud that when taking a nap with my do not disturb sign out, they were yelling outside often door so loudly that I heard them over the hum of the heater and tv on low that I had on to ironically drown out noise. When I called to complain that the housekeepers were yelling Down the hall at each other, the staff just laughed and said sorry. Also- upon check out- there were there cop cars at the hotel and one cop at the front desk discussing an incident. Didn't make me feel safe."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Convenient and good value,We used hotel's free shuttle service to the Metro station daily during our vacation. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable. We noticed two negatives in the room: the paint in bathroom was pealing badly and the tub did not drain well the first day. We reported the drain issue and they fixed it while we were away the next day. We had stayed at this hotel 3 years ago and we will likely stay here again in the future.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,1,The Staff Refused to Honor the Requests for refund,Expedia and I the Purchase of Service Not Rendered and Paid For..hummm What do you Think I bought INSURANCE from EXPEDIA what a JOKE - YOU GUYS ARE FUNNY NOT SO MUCH
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Lits confortables,"bonne impression en general, personnel courtois et polis.Point a ameliorer: eclairage des chambres qui est faible la nuit."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,convenient to metro but in need of update,"part of the hotel look great and updated, but the room needed a major renovation. carpet was dirty and wrinkled (could trip on it), and the bathroom was dingy: white enamel broken off on bathtub, toilet paper holder coming off the wall, dirty shower curtain, etc. but the bed was relatively comfy and the hotel quiet when we stayed there. complimentary shuttle to metro station was very convenient. staff was not very friendly and we could not order anything at the bar because there wasn't anyone there (bartender at some point was eating nearby in the lobby but did not acknowledge us and at other times the bar was empty)."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Shuttle Bus from Metro is a Unicorn,"Hotel is very nice, but I waited an hour at the metro station for the hotel shuttle bus. I called the hotel twice to ascertain the shuttle's whereabouts, but the shuttle's location remained a mystery. Perhaps it was someone's dinner break I would have walked, it isn't that far, but this was shortly after the big snow storm."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,nice to sleep in,The experience was ok. It was nice hotel . Staff was pleasant.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Rozsadny Hotel za bardzo dobra cene.,Rozsadny Hotel za bardzo dobra cene.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,"convenient location, comfortable room",Tim was great.location is very convenient. Staff was very friendly. Breakfast was very basic.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,best service,So much better than we expected for the price. The desk service was exceptionaly nice. I agree the mattress was a bit soft and we needed a reading light over the chair. Those aren't complaints just comments.Thank you for making our stay so enjoyable.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,"Good hotel, nothing nearby","The hotel was good. Clean rooms and friendly staff, unfortunately, there is nothing to do in the immediate area. It is close to the Metro station but other than that, there were not a lot of choices within walking distance for shopping, restaurants, etc."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Great hotel close to the Washington Beltway,"Everyone was very friendly. The breakfast is outstanding! This is where our family always stays whenever we are in the Washington, D. C. area."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Football,"Convient to highway , food, Resturants and fed X field"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Quick getaway,The facility is nice and has a great lobby and bar for happy hour events. Enjoyed my stay which was nice and quiet. The renovated rooms were very comfortable.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Good experience overall,"Most probably I would give it a excellent review if it was not for the service obtained on Saturday. Sam (shuttle driver), Ester, Ana (Bar attendants) and front desk personnel for Thursday and Friday gave us a 5 star service. Everything went down to the drain Saturday afternoon had to wait for over an hour at the train station driver and front desk attendant blamed each other. I put it behind and most definitely I would stay again good breakfast, good service overall, location, rooms are kept clean."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,"Metro Points in New Carrollton, MD","Given the location of the hotel, it wasn't a bad stay. I know the name on the outside has changed a few times but the interior hasn't changed much at all.. The over night desk clerk mumbles when he speaks making my late night check-in that much more agonising. The maintenance housekeeping crew were overly polite and courteous, loved it. The front desk clerk and manager both over night and day shifts need to take a page from their fellow employees book on manners."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Pictures do not tell the truth,"When I looked at the pictures , I thought that I have an excellent deal at hand but it turned out to be a total let down ...This hotel is not even worth comparing to a MOTEL6 or SUPER8 . It is run down and shabby . Will not stay here ever."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,D. C. area hotel,Only complaint was the room got very hot during the night because the thermostat was not working properly. Have stayed at this location before and did not have any problem with heating or cooling.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Nice hotel. Right by the belt way. Close to D.C.,I enjoyed it. Breakfast is great although you did not have oatmeal that morning which I always love so that was not pleasant for me for breakfast. Please always have oatmeal.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,"Nice Remodeling Work, but Noisy","This hotel was a good value. The rooms are clean and comfortable and mine was newly upgraded. The hotel staff was courteous and helpful. The only real issue is the noise...constant hammering that seemed as though it was in the room next to me. Also, the hot water in my bathroom did not function, so I ended up taking a cold shower. Needless to say, the noise and lack of hot water made for a disappointing stay from the standpoint of comfort. Still, a good value with easy parking and not too far from either DC or Baltimore if you are visiting."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,No consideration for late arrivals,"The bathtub had scratches on it that shows black rust. The breakfast ends too early (9:00 a.m.), so if you are coming from a wedding party at 2:30 a.m. you can't sleep enough because you have to rush to have b-fast, and if you have kids you are for sure to miss it! Yet, rooms are spacious, TV is new, internet connection is good, and so is the location. Except from B-fast time and tub condition, I liked it."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,I was not happy with my room at all,"The bed was broken , there was no hot water nd when I Asked for another room they said no"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Four day stay,"Booked through online site and they got my name wrong over the phone but that wasn't the hotels fault. It wasn't the worst place I have stayed at all. A few problems though. The internet did not work in the room or the lobby on any of our devices, ipod, ipad, laptop, nothing. Did use the computer in the business center. They advertise a breakfast buffet in the lounge but it wasn't represented well with that title. Consisted of eggs, waffle (premade), cereal, toast so I was a little disappointed. The shuttle picked us up at the Metro 15 minutes late after I called twice. Otherwise, the staff was friendly and the room was clean."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,1,unfriendly front desk ruins everything,very lousy front desk
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Recomendado 100,Es un excelente Hotel. Las habitaciones son muy bonitas y el desayuno es muy bueno. Desde la estacion del metro en New Carrollton (a menos de 4 minutos del hotel en carro) nos tardamos menos de 25 minutos en llegar a la estacion del metro Smithsonian. Recomendado 100!!!!n
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,1,Nasty Ants!!!,I was very uncomfortable after seeing ants in my room and the tub acrylic was chipping away... This stay was not sanitary!!! We moved to another room but my comfort level was gone!!! I just felt dirty!!! I expected a better stay for the price I paid.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Convienent access to interstate..,"Served it's purpose... room is clean and comfortable, bathroom has very limited spaces.."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Great deal,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for one night for the Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington this past weekend. It was more than adequate for being a place to spend the night. We liked that the room and bathroom were spacious. The location was ideal for someone who drove to the area. I believe the hotel also has a shuttle to the nearby metro station. It is a 15-20 minute drive to Washington in regular, non-congested traffic. The breakfast buffet was standard but I would really expect much for the price we paid. I like that they have their own parking lot and they are just down the street from numerous fast food establishments and a supermarket. The gentleman at the reception desk was a bit short with us and another couple who were checking in before is but nothing that is worth complaining about. Overall I would recommend this hotel as it is a good bargain and is close to highway access and public transportation."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Just one dreamless sleep night!,Location is great for all budget shoppers and easy access to interstates highway. Breakfast was awesome!!
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Four Points,"There was a free breakfast buffet, but the hotel did not let us know the hours of it. When we showed up at 9:32, they said it closed at 9:30. We reserved a king sized bed and got a room with two doubles. They told us we were not guaranteed the bed choice that we wanted. There is no restaurant, lounge or bar as it says on the website. The shuttle was good to use and runs pretty much every 30 minutes up to 4:30 ish. If you need to return to the hotel after 10:10 when the shuttle stops, take a taxi. The cost was 7.50 and it was worth it. The nearest metro station is too far from D.C. Next time I will stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington again."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Quick getaway away from the kids,"20 Extra charge for King bed, 10 charge for a microwave in the room, but couldn't put it in because maintenance wasn't on site. The room was decent and clean. The staff was friendly enough. Another guest with body odor permeated the lobby with her essence and it was quickly addressed. Location is very convenient and the price was reasonable. We missed breakfast, so I cannot provide feedback on that."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Ottima alternativa per visitare Washington,L'hotel e a 20 minuti da Washington ma si raggiunge facilmente grazie ad una superstrada e il prezzo e molto conveniente rispetto alle grandi catene presenti in citta.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Great Staff Good Price,"I needed a clean comfortable room at the last minute due to my being called back to work at the last minute, and The Metro Points fit the bill. Special Thanks to Lavere (front desk) for his professionalism kindness."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,"Convenient for the game, a few things to improve","Heater was blowing cool air in morning. Some things in the room seemed shoddy or unfinished like sprinkler, wall around the light switch, and when you first enter one of the lightswitches that I believe was meant to turn on the lamps did nothing. Also we were only there one nite but in that time our room keys both got deactivated. We were very pleased with complimentary breakfast offerings except that there was cream cheese but no bagels and the type of milks were not labeled."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Ripped Off on ROOM PRICE,"We paid for a 150.00 room but put in a room which is 75.00. I checked the rooms because my sister stayed in the 75.00 room which is exactly the same as ours. We were ripped off. The two beds in room are very small, my husband and I couldn't sleep on the same bed. One of us slept on the couch which was uncomfortable too. No more!!!"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,1,Don't be fooled,"The best part of the stay at Metro Points besides check out was the staff. I commend them for working in such deplorable conditions. I was extremely disappointed. From the outside, peering through the window, the hotel is beautiful. When I entered I was met by stained carpet and dirty walls. Although check in was easy (Kudos to Mr. Davis) who worked hard to accommodate me. However, he could not fix the peeling paint, the spotty drapes, the snowy picture, the no wifi the entire time I was there, the sink with no running water and the tub with no knobs. This hotel has the potential to be very good. Management cannot be oblivious to all the defects. Management needs to get it together. It's the little things that keep customers or drive them away. I drove away with no intention of ever returning."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,unforgettable,Fanatic
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,"Good hotel, but not so crazy about the area","Pros: - Clean and comfortable - Good housekeeping - Fast and free Wi-Fi - Great complementary English-style breakfast with lots of hot food such as sausages, pancakes, eggs, English muffins, etc. - Next door to a supermarket Cons: - Commute to Washington by car can be a nightmare during morning rush hours (took more than an hour to get there even though it was only about 20km) - Location a little ghetto with non-guests hanging around the hotel front door and lobby"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,"Metro Point of Washington in Wash., DC area","The suite was nice and roomy, however the carpet in the whole hotel was dirty but staff was cleaning the hall carpet before my departure. The shower door was off track and the sink in the kitchen stopped up but staff remedied the problem. The hotel was in a very good location and is accessible to metro and the highway."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,close to my event and rates were very reasonable.,The stay was pleasant but some of the staff did not seem to be knowledgable about the hotel's policies and billing. Only one person was really helpful.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,todo bien,"Es un buen hotel. Ubicado muy cerca del metro y con servicio de transporte a la estacion gratis cada 30 minutos. El personal muy amable, en especial DANNY Y SAN, quienes son la salvacion de los que solo hablamos espanol. Las habitaciones muy buenas, aunque no lujosas, pero si por encima de las basicas de otros hoteles. al centro son 10 estaciones, no hay pierde pues es la ultima parada de una linea corta. aprox. 40 minutos. el desayuno bueno. En general volveria sin pensarlo y lo recomiendo. No te hacen ningun cargo extra.Si llegas despues de las 10:30 puedes tomar taxi muy facilmente, siempre hay 10 o 20 afuera y te cobran aprox. 10 dolares. A diferencia de otros hoteles un poco mas lujosos se caracterizan por ser muy amables y comprensivos. al frente hay toda clase de restaurantes, supermercados y algunos comercios"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Comodo pero lejos del centro,"El hotel en general de muy buena calidad y a buen precio. Solo que un poco alejado del centro y lugares de interes, pero muy recomendable para caminar y conocer un poco mas de la ciudad."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Great Hotel,"Hotel looked very nice and modern, rooms are very comfortable and have refrigerators which was great for us to store drinks. Room was very clean and the ammenities were plenty. Only thing is that rooms have LCD's but no HDTV cable, so quality of image was not what it's supposed to be. Check-in/out was very prompt and efficient. Will definitely stay at this hotel again if in DC area."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Everything OK,"The main lobby and dining areas were clean. The room was musty and damp. The floor on one side of the bed was damp and sticky. Breakfast was alright - no healthy options, but it was fine."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,"A good deal, not to be passed up.","My extended weekend stay at this hotel was very enjoyable. I have no complaints. I would strongly advise, though, that guests make use of the shuttle service to and from the subway station. However, the immediate environs of the hotel are quite pleasing. There is an international supermarket in the plaza across the street. Quite a convenience."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Great stay,Check in was speedy. Everything was clean. Room was comfy. The breakfast was a little average but overall everything was fine.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Not good as expected,"Wants to charge extra for everything. Micro wave, Refrigirator and glass of water. Have to wait 15 minutes to get hot water. Also another 15 minutes to bath tub water to drain. We book all most 25 rooms all the same story with bath tub."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,good choice!,This hotel has a very good relation betwen price and value.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Great hotel,There for a week and every day every staff member was very helpfull. They have a shuttle to the metro station and the drivers were very nice. They even gave us their cell to call them so we won't have to wait. The cleaning crew was always helful and friendy. The room was super and the beds were really good. Breakfast was good and you have the convenience of a 7eleven across the street to pack some water and snacks for the day. For shure we'll be back to this great hotel. THANK YOU!
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,"Nice place, but breakfast is so-so.","I like this place, even though it is a 30-minute commute to my work location, but the shuttle to Metro is convenient. This time one of the elevators was out of service with a note that it would be fixed the Monday of my arrival, but it was still out of commission when I left. The only drawback is the breakfast. One day, they added some sausage patties to the steamer table and it was actually cold--not even room temperature. It should have been heated first, because it appeared to be leftover from another day (and not just 1 day ago because the day before they had links, not patties). The last day, there wasn't even really meat. They had eggs, potatoes and grits along with corned beef hash, which is more of a potato entree--not a meat entree. For someone like myself, who doesn't eat potatoes, there was essentially no meat. Hopefully in the future, there will be plain meat--either bacon or sausage. I would not hesitate to come back here in the future."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Great location and excellent hotel,We were a famaily of 4. Great hotel. The lobby and the room were top class. Almost like a luxury hotel. Breakfast was included in the price. Excellent breakfast. Very happy to choose this one. Will come back next time.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,"Clean, attractive, friendly and small","The room looked like it was recently redone, it and the lobby were very attractive. But be aware that the closet rod (really a cabinet) was one foot long and there was not a single drawer for clothes. This would be a nice, reasonably priced room for one night. Shuttle service was great, breakfast hot but unremarkable."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Estadia en Washington,"Excelente hotel buena atencion y la ubicacion buena , lo unico que falta para que sea completo el hotel es que tenga una nevera ejecutiva. Del resto excelente ."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,not bad,easy to washington
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Visitor to DC first time,"Fair price for location...clean, new looking. I'll do it again...great free breakfast"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Best hotel in New Carrollton,"I was there for a week and my stay was very comfortable. The sheets are very soft and clean, the pillows were really plushie and the room was very clean. As a woman traveling alone, I felt safe inside the Hotel. The continental breakfast was very good but could have offered fruit."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,poor,"To noisey, other guest were to loud kids running up and down hallways. After coming back to room from being out all day room smelt like weed, coming from room next door. Room above the bathroom when guest would take showers you can hear the water dropping on our ceiling causing a large water stain on ceiling. To expensive for that stay with all problems."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Hot water problems,"Not only did the shower for my room not have hot water (so they gave me another room but still it was inconvenient when I was rushing to catch a train), but the new room they assigned me to had extremely hot water running in the toilet! (I could tell by the steam and intense heat coming from the toilet after flushing). The hotel definitely has been very well refurbished and the condition of everything is of high quality, EXCEPT that it doesn't seem they've worked out all of their plumbing details yet."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Adequate,"Hotel was worth the price. Some false advertising, like complimentary bottled water and newspaper. Front desk can use a little customer relations training."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,"Metro Points Hotel - New Carollton, MD","Nice, clean rooms, safe - ( they had a night guard on every floor ), friendly helpful staff, good service, efficient shuttle to metro station. The surrounding neighborhood was OK, but not an area you'd want to spend time in. The commute to DC via car and metro was not bad, but a bit longer than I would have liked. The hotel was right off the exit."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Modestly priced hotel,The hotel was just okay. They are under construction and the location has quite a bit of road noise. The room I was in had and older bed and the bathroom could have used some updating. One good thing was the bathroom was clean.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Disappointing,"Very tired hotel. Floors were cement hard, covered with a thin rug - no pad underneath."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,"Nice Hotel, Good Price","My experience was good, the staff was helpful, professional, and happy to help. The hotel is old though, the hotel has done a nice job on keeping it up but the rooms really show their age."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Not bad hotel,The internet was broke for one night The staff were not helpful and almost rude The toilet also borke Totally not good experience
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Issue with Shuttle to Hotel,"After arriving at the train stop having taken the train from the Baltimore airport, I called the hotel for the shuttle to pick me up. There was no signage for where the pickup was to meet the shuttle. Unfortunately, I didn't listen carefully to the description of where the pick up would be, so I assumed it was on the opposite side of the train tracks, and I missed it. Moral of the story: don't assume you know where the shuttle bus will pick you up. After that, The shuttle worked very well. In the room, the bathroom smelled funky and the air conditioning unit was noisy. The breakfast was very good, and the staff was friendly."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,good hotel will stay again at property,The hotel was clean and the imenities met my needs.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Excellent choice,"Good breakfast, clean rooms. Potentially a dodgy neighborhood"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,no recomendable,no hubo agua caliente ninguna de las 3 noches que nos hospedamos. Nos quejamos reiteradamente con el gerente y no brindo ninguna solucion.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Awesome place to relax while on vacation in DC,This was in a good location not far from DC. Staff was extremely friendly and efficient. Inside of hotel was nice and breakfast was great.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Renovations,"It seems like the hotel is still undergoing renovations and that everything is not quite finished yet. However, I think it will be nice once finished. They do have more modern furnishings in the room like plasma tv, and computer hookups."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Buen hotel a un excelente precio,El hotel estuvo muy bien.La habitacion espaciosa y muy limpia. Tienen servicio de shuttle que te deja en la estacion de metro de new carrollton.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,1,Terrible,"This place is a dump. The rooms are not clean. The beds are smaller than a normal double bed. The sheets and blankets have cigarette burns in them. The mattress in my room had been torn open with the springs exposed. The rooms all have terrible perfume smell. Only a few channels on the TV work, some don't have sound. The ice machine was full of mold. The overall area that the hotel is in a bad place. When the police are constantly outside in the parking lot it's a sign not to stay there."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Not that great,"The lobby was very nice, but that was about it. the room was not at all what you would expect from the description. I had to deodorize the room due to a strange odor, it wasn't horrible but unpleasant. The bed was not comfortable, but was semi-clean other than a well worn sheet. The AC did work very well and the the TV was a recent upgrade, too bad the hotel only had 5 channels to choose from. Overall, I was disappointed with the room and I am thankful I only stayed a single night. I would not stay there again and probably would not stay in a hotel in the surrounding area either."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Very nice experience,"The staff was very professional and helpful. The room's are very modern and clean. I was very please with the complimentary continental breakfast of eggs, fruit orange juice french toast and waffles and coffee. I would highly recommend this establishment."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Do not stay here,"In addition to having to ask to be moved three times after seeing the initial condition of the room I was assigned (something I have never done in nearly 100 hotels I have stayed at), they carpet was so dirty I refused to take off my socks, the nightstand had a sticky substance on the surface and in the drawers, the furniture was old, worn and dirty, the staff was not terribly helpful and the neighborhood is in an economically depressed area and I did not feel completely safe at night being a single woman travelling alone. There are multiple signs in the parking lot warning that the hotel is not responsible for any damage or theft and I was worried about my car being broken into. Only pros- just off the highway and one of the nicest hotel gyms I've ever seen. Even so, I will NEVER stay here again! If I hadn't already paid in advance through hotels.com, I would have left immediately."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,1,Nasty,The worst experience in my life please never go close to tis hotel ughhhhh nasty rooms smells bad
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Metro Points Washington DC,"If I knew how far away and the sketchy neighborhood this hotel was, I never would have stayed there. There is nothing but fast food in the area and walking after dark is questionable. The room smelled of cleaning chemicals, the wireless service was weak, and maintenance did not come when called. No hairdryer - had to call the desk for one. Toilet paper holder falling off wall. They did a good job making this hotel look good in the pictures, but it was run-down. The van did come when they said it would, but be prepared to wait a long half-hour if you miss it."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Nice hotel,"It was wondering, I had a great time, food was great"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,"Great value, great staff.",Everybody from the front desk to those that cleaned the room did a fantastic job of making our stay very enjoyable. Thanks to all of them.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,The rooms are very clean but the area is not safe,Good hotel for the price. Good rooms with nice views-unsafe location that's why there is a shuttle from the hotel to the 15 minute walk subway station. Very Very basic and boring breakfast (eggs-potatoes-waffle-tea-coffee).
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Good location to DC,Overall very excellent. No negative all positive. I think for the price you can't go wrong. Also it was a quiet atmosphere.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,excelente!,"Me parecio un excelente hotel, a pesar de estar lejos de Washington es muy facil llegar alli, el shuttle te lleva a la estacion del tren y en 20 minutos estas en el centro de Washington, el personal es muy amable y aunque no todos hablan ingles hacen lo posible por entender y hacerse entender. El senor del shuttle habla espanol y es muy amable. El desayuno es agradable y variado. En general es un hotel recomendado para pasar unos dias, descansar y visitar la ciudad."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Location Location Location,Great location Close to where I needed to do business. Service so-so and hotel barely accerptable. I needed hotel accomodations for 3 weeks. If the Metro had been acceptable I would have stayed the entire time. Instead I chose to stay at another hotel in GreenBelt (Holiday Inn) one exit away. Just as great a location and much better service and accomodations. Price was about the same.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Good stay,"First on all Sam the shuttle driver was great!!!!! I can not say enough about him. To get to the hotel, you must call for the shuttle to guarantee they will arrive at their schedule times or take a taxi which should cost you 5. We were burned upon arrival with a 10 fee while he stayed on his mobile phone. Turns out the hotel is a quick 3 to 4 minute ride. The hotel is definitely too far to walk and neighborhood between metro and hotel is a bit sketchy with the apartments but the hotel is in a descant and quiet area. The check in staff did not seem too friendly nor helpful when asked about surrounding area. Once we got to know Sam, everything became better. He made sure we got got to metro station which is very convenient on time and inquired when we would return. He was there waiting!!!! Hotel is doing some remodeling but does not effect your stay. Thanks again Sam!!!!!"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Great hotel near D.C.,Metro Points Hotel provides wonderful service for a very reasonable price. They even offer a convenient shuttle service to and from the nearest metro station at no extra charge. Every staff member was helpful and pleasant.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Mixed,"The hotel was clean, and in good repair for the most part. The internet was sketchy, and did not work for the first night. The availability of wireless being the reason I choose this hotel, this was quite bothersome. It is kind of a ride to DC, though not terrible. The shuttle service picking us up from the train was late despite numerous calls. Some of the customer service was better than others, just depends who you talk to. The surrounding area leaves something to be desired. In the end, it was not terrible, but it was not great either."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Great stay. Great value,Booked a room last min under promotion. Came with free breakfast. Nice hotel.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Good Buy For last Minute,"I booked this hotel for a last minute New Years stay-cation and it lived up to my expectations, for it to be New Years the staff was really helpful and friendly, and the hotel was filled to capacity but it still didn't seen crowded at all. And the breakfast buffet in the morning definitely came to a rescue from an evening of New Years partying"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Great Location Good People..!,Smooth transaction: incredible location (a stone's throw off I-95) REALLY good food at the bistro in the lobby a smoking-hot PuertoRican chick tending bar on my last night that got me utterly destroyed ---thumbs up...!!!Cant wait to come back...!
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,good hotel to stay,Nice hotel with the that price.. Breakfast was served well..
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Convenient and modern,"Although my stay was just a quick overnight, I was impressed by the looks and convenient location of this hotel."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Nice hotel near DC,"The hotel was surprisingly good. Our room was very clean and spacious for 2 people. The bed was extremely comfortable. I especially liked the pillows that they provided. It gave just the right amount of support to my neck to relieve the stress and fatigue after roaming in scorching Washington DC heat on 4th July weekend (100 F). Hotel staff was super helpful. As soon as we checked into our room, within half an hour hotel attendant provided couple of extra towels without requesting. I especially liked this nice gesture because anyone tired of traveling in hot weather will take a nice bath and would need extra towels for early morning next day. Breakfast was average in terms of variety and quality. Neighborhood is definitely not good. There are couple of police cars always in the Hotel campus. So walking to Metro station is out of question. I wish the free hotel shuttle frequency to metro station was like every 10 mins instead of half an hour. It hardly takes 2 mins by shuttle to reach the metro station. But if you miss it (we did miss by couple of mins, while waiting for the elevator to arrive), you have to wait half an hour for next shuttle. All in all it was nice experience. I would definitely stay again."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Nice access to Metro,"Nice hotel, terrible area. Loud traffic. Would not stay there again."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,This Hotel need a lot of work,"It is true that you get what you pay for, the hotel staff was very friendly, but the first issue was with the AC , the hallways are like a oven, they only have 2 window AC units on each end of the hallways, when you come out of your elevator or room it is like you are getting into a sauna, ( very uncomfortable), the water pressure is very poor, it is like you take a shower with a medicine dropper and if somebody flush the toilet the water is gone until the toilet tank stop refilling, the drain in the bath tub was plug, need to call maintenance to fix it, and for last when you check in they tell you that breakfast has one type of meat in a daily basis (bacon or sausage), on my 4 days stay not even one day the meat appeared. I can said this is the worst hotel I stay on the last few years I travel. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL, NOT EVEN FOR THE CHEAP PRICE."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,OK hotel in the middle of nowhere,"Booked this hotel due to proximity to Fedex Field only to realize it was 40 mins by metro. It would have been better to stay at a nicer hotel in a better area and take the metro from there. When i asked if i could walk back from the metro after the game, reception told me it might be better to run with the watch you're wearing."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,"Nice hotel, close to many major attractions.","The hotel was very good,I didn't have any problems. The staff was very friendly and helpful."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Metro-points 8500 new carlt. MD Great to stay at!!,"Had a wonderful time here, and I will be coming back! The rooms are very nice, it's located perfectly close to everything, and the staff accommodates your needs to the best of their ability!"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,1,Avoid this property,"Staff was rude, hotel is dirty, no hot water, questionable neighborhood. Was one of the worst hotels I have visited. The low rate is not low enough. Would not recommend under any circumstance. Pay the extra fifty dollars a night and stay at the Courtyard."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Hotel close to neighborhood amenities.,Room was decent for a night's stay. I've stayed in a cleaner room a few weeks earlier. Perhaps the last room was slightly more updated as well. Staff is always so nice and helpful.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Nice hotel,"This is the best in that price I've ever had. We stayed in room 807 ,The room was big,clean,and comfortable, everything is good for us."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,A few hiccups but convenient and acceptable,"We made a reservation for a King room. Upon checkin, we were given a key to a 9th floor room. To our surprise, when we opened the door, it was a room with two beds. Back to the lobby we went to inform the staff and be moved to another room. The next room we were given was on the 5th floor. Upon entering, the tv was on, one of the TWO (again) beds was unmade. Carried all of our luggage back down to the front desk AGAIN to be moved. We were then upgraded to a suite in the seventh floor which satisfied me and made me much less angry. The room was very clean and a great size. When we went to the simon area at night to eat, we stood at the deal for ten minutes while the staff only looked at us. I finally walked over to someone and asked about eating and they informed me they were closing in 3 minutes. Would have been nice if one of the waitresses came over to inform us they were closing instead of just looking at us stand there waiting to be seated."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,Needs improvement,"Part of hotel was under renovation, it was also noisy. Not a good bargain."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Convenient location,"Right off the interstate, over priced for the rooms and their current condition. Rug in the room stained and room smelled moldy. Checked out early...."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,1,Not so good,"I was highly disappointed this time around. This is my second time staying at this hotel and I did not like anything about our room. The 1st time we stayed here the room and price was great so we decided to stay again. We wanted a Jacuzzi and we were told in the room description that we would have one, but instead when we got to the room we had a regular jetted tub that did not work at all. We paid double for a room expecting something spectacular and we got nothing. The breakfast was okay, but it was so congested that you really could not enjoy your meal . Unfortunately, we will not be staying at this hotel again."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Close to metro,Worked out perfect for our sightseeing in DC.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,"good hotel, with a resonable price","had some minor problems, but all corrected, and had a comfortable stay."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Wonderful place to stay.,Loved this hotel. The staff was wonderful. There was a complimentary shuttle to take you to the subway. We were there to visit Washington which was only a 35 minute ride so we did not have to drive our car. The complimentary breakfast was great with lots of choice.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Great Hotel!,It was very nice i enjoyed myself
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,otimo custo beneficio,Adorei! Recomendo a todos! Apesar de nao ficar em Washington fica muito perto o que facilitou muito para conhecermos a capital com um custo de hotel do interior.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Nice location!,"Nice location, nice front desk service."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Great location,Good location-room nice and near good places to eat.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,"It was an outstanding hotel,","My experience was wonderful, will look forward to book it again in the future. The room was just what I was expecting for and the staffs were very friendly and attentively."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Serves as an overnighter that's it.,I had to change my from because room 610 tub looked like it was painted on the inside. The hotel served it purpose for an overnight stay..No 4 or 5*.overall decent for 1 night.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Good Stay!,Good stay!
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Great for a DC visit,Everyone was great. Very close to the Metro.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Very good!,"I was concerned about the location, because of the reviews, but it is a nice area. Far, of course, from the points of interest, but if you want to stay right next to rhe White House you have to pay the price. Very eficient staff, very clean room. I just hated the restaurant. The waitress was very slow, the food was not so bad, but when it finally got to our table it was already cold. I would rather go to McDonald's."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Midway between DC Annapolis,Free brkfst is decent. Room is nice and clean and cool. Bed -comfy. Only weird thing about room is they didn't bother with sub flooring under the carpet. Dips and bumps under the carpet.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,2,"More of a motel, not hotel!","Our room smelled like cigarette and it was dingy! Thankfully the manager was willing to give us a new room and upgraded to a suite. I think ALL the carpet needs to be replaced in all the rooms. This place should be categorized as a motel, not a hotel. Staff was nice though."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Very nice hotel stay,Everything was great. The staff at the front desk were very friendly and made you feel comfortable. Would recommend to anyone and would stay here again when I am in the area.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Location,"Needed a good value hotel. This turned out to be perfect. Heavily booked, but it did not affect customer service from the employees I had contact with."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Cheap,"Not in the greatest area, but cant complain about the price per night. Hotel has been renovated, but has thin walls and has shaired doors with the rooms next door causing lots of the sounds to come from underneath. The doors are sturdy and solid, but makes a lot of noise when they close. Hotel is very close to the Amtrak and metro station, shuttles arived 10 min late but is available"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Wonderful Hotel,"I was a little worried by some of the reviews I read that stated the staff was rude and the hotel was in disrepair but the price was amazing so we went ahead and booked....and I'm SO GLAD WE DID!! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (and I'm from the South, so I know friendly.) The hotel has normal wear and tear, but was very clean and nicely furnished. Some people may not like that the microwave and fridge are extra (would have been nice to have but we wouldn't have used either so it didn't bother us). Beds are very comfortable and rooms are large enough to lounge in the evenings after a long day. The free shuttle service was great. The Metro (subway) is farther away than listed. The site stated 1/4 mi, but it's closer to 3/4 or 1mi. We had no problem walking it during the day. If this is your first visit, be sure to ask specifically where the shuttle will pick up. We were on the wrong side and missed it the first time. If you exit the Metro up the escalators, go out and to the left up the steps to where there are several bus stops. If you exit to the right near the greyhound stop (and a several story parking garage), you're on the wrong side. The shuttle drivers were very nice and happy to give directions and tips. Once you're on the Metro, a 20min ride gets you into the city. Definitely worth it to save hundreds on a hotel room. There are several restaurants right outside the hotel and several more within 1/4-1/2mi walk. There are also some smaller shopping places if you forget any necessities. We would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely return if we're ever back in the DC area."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Good service but broken things,"The hotel would not. The hair dryer was broken. The cable was out in the area. However, when we caller for service they came to repair the toilet and the hairdryer right away."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Excellent and Great Price,"comfortable, clean and affordable"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Wonderful room at an outstanding price,"Don't believe the negative reviews we stayed at this hotel for four nights and looked forward to coming home each night. My girlfriend used to work at a hotel and she thought the room was typical of hotels costing 50 more a night. Clean room, comfy bed, nice bathroom, friendly staff and free shuttle to the metro, which is half a mile away (takes about 20 mins to ride to Capitol). We heard sounds from neighboring rooms only once, and the noise was faint. Only complaint was the room service - it took 75 minutes to arrive but they gave it to us free. Reading other reviews, we were a little worried about the neighborhood. Don't be. Yes, it's not the best part of town but those who call it a ghetto are way off. We walked to the metro once (and back at night) and we always felt safe. This is a great way to see DC and not spend a ton at a downtown hotel."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Very nice stay,I enjoyed my stay
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Nice hotel,"Went on May 2015. Rest of the DC hotels were either sold out or very expensive. Overall it was ok. Rooms were fairly clean, breakfast wasn't that good (always out of something), staff was helpful, check in/out was quick and painless. Free parking is a plus. Depending on the day/time its about 30-45 min to downtown DC by car. They also offer shuttle service to nearest train station till 10pm everyday. I'd pick a closer hotel to downtown, but like I said there wasn't anything below 300, 84 was a steal :)"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,nice stay!,it was nice!
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Great Hotel-Close to Six Flags and Downtown D.C.,The staff were extremely helpful. They offered directions and even a weather report for us during our stay. The room was very comfortable and well stocked with towels. Breakfast was simple but very satisfying. It is only open for about 2 hours. It has been updated and I really liked the improvements. You can tell that the owners and staffers care about their property and it shines through. I would absolutely stay here again. Very reasonable and a perfect location. Less then a minute from I-95.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,"Terrible. No light, back up power failed the test.","On Monday while watching a news program, the light went off. I waited 10mins nothing happened and I called the front desk and I was told something like: light went out in the entire New Carrollton area. That was not their fault but not to have adequate preparation and provision in case of such occurrence is unacceptable. I was unaware when the back up power came up because my room never had light until the New Carrollton light came back. Business should be business. I paid for a full service, not spending some moment in darkness. Thank you."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Great service and location,"This hotel is outside of DC, but its shuttle goes directly to the metro, which goes directly to sites in DC. Everyone on the staff was helpful and friendly. Breakfast was served starting at 6:30am, which allowed us to depart early each day. We would stay here again."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Overnight,It was very nice. The staff was professional and friendly. The free breakfast was a nice treat.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,A good hotel if location is not a problem,"Its far from DC. but hotel is good. Sorrounding also is good, lots of eating places nearby. Room was big and worth its price. But AC was not too cool. Hotel should provide a fridge in the room. My kid picked up a wafer which she put it back. But I find they charged me for that from my credit card statement. They did not even confirm from me. I had to lodge a complaint and they reverted back the amount."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,best motel ever,This may be the best motel I have ever stayed in. My wife still wants to go back so we can sleep in the bed again. Very nice!
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Trip to Nation's Capital,"Had a 7:30am tour of the White House and wanted to be near public transportation (New Carrolton Station). Metro Points fit the bill and was recently renovated. A good price from Expedia sealed the deal for us. Upon arrival we found the staff to be helpful and friendly. The two adjoining rooms were clean and well appointed. Local amenities offered a wide choice of restaurants, and a local IHOP was open 24x7 to support our early morning breakfast and travel needs. MetroPoint even provided a 15 discount. We would definitely stay again."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Great place to rest your head for DC getaway,We visited for a game at FedEx field and took some time to also enjoy DC. This hotel fit out needs for both. Wish the breakfast was longer during the week for those looking to get some shuteye since it was our vacation :) we opted for Starbucks across the street instead of waking for a buffet that closed at 9am. Shuttle to metro station was super convenient. One elevator broke leaving the whole hotel to function in chaos since the stairs were only for emergency. Carpet in our room was heavy soiled and in need of replacement. Only thing missing was a pool.....
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,"Clean, Friendly, Good Value","Clean room and public areas, updated colors and design. Good full American breakfast (scrambled eggs were very fluffy, not soggy and runny). A 5 glass of wine at the lobby bar was extremely reasonable. Hotel had several motorcoach groups there, but the front desk seemed to process their check-in/check-out very efficiently. All staff very courteous and friendly. Hotel shuttle runs to the metro stop, so you can easily get into D.C. without driving. I'd stay here again."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,DC trip to 9er game,"The hotel offered many amenities that were beneficial to us for the reason for our stay such as, comfortable rooms and breakfast. Upon arrival a round trip service from the hotel to stadium was being offered for 20 dollars a person. We immediately jumped on the deal due to being unfamiliar with the area, as well as my wife expecting our first baby. She is restricted to the amount of walking she is to do and we didn't want to walk to and from the metro station in the dark. Our driver never picked us up at the drop off location, when speaking to him he misled us to where we were to go to meet him, he hung up on us and a police officer, and shut off his phone. We didn't get picked up until an hour and half after the game by the boss of the company. The whole ordeal was very frustrating and unorganized. We did get half of our money back from the second driver/boss of the company. When returning to the hotel the staff didn't seem concerned with the mishap. I don't think the hotel hired a credible company to provide shuttle services to their guests. Any guest should be cautious about using an outside shuttle service provided by this hotel."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,This hotel is upscale but the price is budget.,This site was very nice. It's close to the interstate and close to DC. You won't be disappointed.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,A good hotel,Very good experience. But the staff manner need improve.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Decent hotel,"The hotel was nice. New renovations, the breakfast was very very good, and the rooms were clean. The shuttle to the Metro was great. The front desk workers were not nice and unprofessional. Seemed like they hated their job. They also take 100 out for a security deposit. They said I'll get it back within 17 business days. The location is sketchy. Do not walk at night. Really nothing to do around that area unless you have a car or hoping onto the Metro."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,average,"The hotel had a convenient location, right outside of the interstate and 5 minutes from the metro station. The front desk people were okay but it seems like they are always in a hurry - from checking in, checking out or even just asking a question. The breakfast was great, it was a hot breakfast not just bagels and hotcakes. We had eggs, grits, sausages and such. The cleaning ladies were awesome! Every time we got back to the hotel after lunch, our room was already made and our towels changed. The shuttle driver, Sam, was awesome too! He made the drive to the metro very fun and was very helpful. Again, if not for the front desk people, this hotel would be great!"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Great Hotel for a Great Price!,This is a great place to stay!
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Gostei,"O hotel e meio longe do centro de Washington, mas valeu pelo conforto e pelo preco. O hotel oferece um transporte para ida e volta para o metro para compensar a distancia: Gostei"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,cheap and convenient,Visited D.C. for two days and found this to be gret for what we needed. Close to the metro and shuttle service to and from. Breakfast was ok...not that much variety but for the price adequate. Only issue we had was with the shuttle one evening we got in about two minutes after the scheduled shuttle from metro to hotel and they would not wait for us. I think a small exception could have been made to wait a minute or two at 10 pm to wait for a guest that was on the phone with you telling you that they were one stop away. Front desk just said sorry we cant wait..next shuttle will be in 30 minutes. We took a taxi and although its probably only a quarter of a mile drive it cost ten dollars. I have mixed feelings about how that situation was handled being in customer service but I can also understand that there has to be structure as well. Overall a good place to stay.. I would recommend it to friends.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,"Nice place to stay,but far from Washington","I picked this place because the parking was free, big mistake. I do not have anything against this nice place but I believe that i won't stay there again. The rooms are clean, the parking is big, there are many different stores and places where to buy anything around, but is also located in a violent area. It was a great stay that I won't repeat."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,You live you learn,Hotel definitely needs updating. Worn carpet everywhere filthy evelator doors. Staff is rude not pleasant at all except nice ladies that work in the restaurant. The shuttle experience was the worst I ever experienced! Driver (the one who walks with a limp) never greeted anyone was never on time.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Excelente,Muy buen hotel
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Comfortable but no communication,"My stay was surprisingly wonderful, except they didn't mention any charges at check in after the bill was paid for ahead of time. If they're going to charge customers after they've already paid ahead of time, then they should at least give the customer the common decency and respect to advise them of such action. People don't like surprise charges and no legit reasons."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Metro Points Stay,I was expecting a more welcoming attitude from the reception. Some of them were nice but there is one guy who was very serious and never smiled. I didn't understand if he had a bad time or this is simply his personality. The floor I stayed on had a little bit of unfresh air on the entrance. I stayed before and room condition was better. Also one time shuttle service took more than one hour to arrive for pickup. We waited from 3:30 pm to 4:40 pm we called at 3:20 pm but looks like they skipped one pick-up turn.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Pleasantly Surprised!,I was very surprised by how modern the hotel was. I heard stories that the hotel wasn't up to par but I found it to be very nice and clean. I would stay again.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Good if you want to avoid DC traffic!,"The hotel was really nice! Although the room furniture was a little outdated, I had no complaints otherwise. A shuttle to the Metro was perfect! The staff was really friendly and accomodating. If you want a DC vacation without the expense or hassle of traffic, stay at this hotel!"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Not bad for the price,"We stayed here for 4 nights while enjoying Washington DC. I had read other reviews of Mid Points before booking so I think I had a realistic expectation. I have to agree with most of the reviews the service was outstanding, the breakfast was awesome and the fitness center was clean and spacious. The website does show a pool, however it does not exist so we brought our suits for nothing. Our room was clean, updated and repaired, but the evidence of previous extensive water damage could still be noticed. It isn't in the greatest part of town, but not as bad as Minnesota Ave. The biggest plus for us was the free shuttle to the Metro station which saved me a ton!"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,It was ok.,The hotel was nice but the staff in the bar were lazy and rude.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Great Location and inexpensive stay,"Was nice location from the long drive from Nutley, NJ to Washington DC. The shower and bathroom facilities is very good. The room is spacious and well lit. The front lights and bathrooms lights were remarkable since it has motion detectors and switches on and off automatically. Overall the stay was welcoming for well traveled guests."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,good place,"clean and comfortable,near dc,good price,good hotel,will come back"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,Good value for price.,Overall experience OK. Hotel had remodel several years ago. Our room's ceiling had only been painted half way. Wallpaper in bathroom was coming lose in several spots. Tile around tub was losing caulk. Breakfast buffet was limited.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Nice place to stay,this is well big and nice place to stay for holiday trip
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Metro Points,"Hotel was in reasonable conditio. We were upgraded to a junior suite. The room was nice, reasonable clean and confortable and located near a Metro Station. The neighborhood was questionable, though we had no problems, I wouldn't recommend going out at night. Breakfast was limited, but plenty of food."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Satisfied,"My experience in this hotel has been one of a kind. Everything seems to be on point. I would recommend this place to others. Also, great price! Full breakfast included. Nice!"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,A holiday that cannot be forgotten in a hurry.,"My wife and I were spoilt silly by sheer hospitality. We had a wonderful stay, my only issue was that we could not be given a hard bed (mattress) so I experienced back pain throughout our stay."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Pleasant place to stay,Friendly desk personnel. Friendly staff. Free shuttle service from the hotel to the metro station. Breakfast arrangements were comfortable. My room had an excellent view. I highly recommend this hotel.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Home away from home,"Got off to a rocky start, but after I was able to make the staff aware of my concerns my stay was FANTASTIC. I will Definitely make this my location of choice when I am in the DC area. I would also like to state there is no one staff member that I can commend over anther. I have been in the service industry for 25 years and it takes a lot to impress me I am impressed!"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,friendly and helpful staff clean and comfortable,The staff were friendly and helpful. the complimentary cooked breakfast was excellent the gym was well equipped and clean
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Nice place to stayclose to WDC,"About 20 min from white house. Nice and clean. IHOP for breakfast right there, at 1 minute walking distance."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,5,Vaction,Pretty good place they are under remodel but they let you know that. You'll feel safe because the cops are always there not because of problems they just hangout there.
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Great room for the money,"We spent 3 nights at the Four Points. It was well worth the money. Very convenient to the metro which we took the 2 full days that we went into Washington D.C. The hotel will take you and pick you up from the metro with their shuttle. The neighborhood is not the greatest, but I felt safe. There are several surrounding business like an Ihop, pizza place, and 7-11. A New Carrollton officer sat in the 7-11 parking lot 2 of the nights we were there. I would definitely recommended Four Points."
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,3,convienient to train station for access to downtow,"nice hotel ,good value being out of DC but not much around area , so if you dont mind being away from night time activity and just want a base to explore DC from it is ideal"
Metro Points Hotel-Washington North,4,Great price!,The hotel is a good pick when the goal is to have a place to crash that is cheaper than the majority in the area and when you want something clean. I did appreciate the shuttle to and from the metro that was provided for free. The hotel doesn't have a lot of extras but it fit the bill for us.
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Alexandria-Landmark",4,A quiet comfort off the beaten path,"I requested a smoking room because my hubby likes cigars and was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the room was! I've stayed in higher-end hotels and the hallways and rooms reeked where smoking was allowed! That was not the case at Extended Stay. Admittedly, it's not the most modern hotel, but it was comfortable, staff was friendly, and it was well-kept. My only minor complaint is that you have to request kitchen amenities. By the time I knew that they weren't in the cabinets, it was late and I didn't feel like bothering to request any."
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Alexandria-Landmark",4,A very nice hotel hidden in a residential area.,"my experience at this hotel was great! The hotel staff was excellent with customer service, they were very helpful."
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Alexandria-Landmark",5,Very nice place. Nice location,Just needed an overnight stay and it was right off the belt way. Very nice place for the price to be honest. Very close to metro and off the main road so you don't see much traffic either.
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Alexandria-Landmark",4,"Business, wonderful George Washington Mount Verno.",Every one was very nice. Thank you. WDC touring was wonderful.
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Alexandria-Landmark",3,"It's okay, kitchenette is convenient",Hidden away from heavy traffic
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Alexandria-Landmark",1,TERRIBLE!,"don't do it. it may save you money, but you will regret it. you get what you pay for, and in the case of this hotel, you don't get what you don't pay for."
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Alexandria-Landmark",2,Horrible Experience,"I rented a non-smoking room for 4 days. Soon as I opened the door, it smelled like smoke. The door handle for the bathroom kept falling apart. Management never fixed. Everytime I exchanged towels for clean ones, there was an issue with them. I had to wait 16 hours, for 2 towels! Very disappointed."
"Extended Stay America Washington, D.C. - Alexandria-Landmark",1,Awful stay!!,"I booked this room for one of my drivers and am appalled at what she reported back to me. The first room had a broken tv that wasn't even connected to the electric/cable. So as not to be blamed for the damage she requested a new room. She was given keys to another room and as she entered the room, somebody was already sleeping in it!! She apologized and went back to the front desk to request a 3rd room. She refused to go to the room without the agent going first to make sure everything was ok with it. The agent complied and came back and issued her the key. Everything seemed ok till she went in the restroom and found the toilet full of what should have flushed away! She called the front desk and reported it but nothing was done about it. This is no way to run a railroad and I won't put any of my drivers there again!!"
"Holiday Inn Express and Suites Exmore, Eastern Shore",4,Great location for Virginia Eastern Shore,I stayed here because I wanted to see the town of Onancock.
"Holiday Inn Express and Suites Exmore, Eastern Shore",1,Not so great,"Room was clean, breakfast was OK and the desk clerks were friendly. Now for the bad: My daughter tried putting brown sugar on her oatmeal and it was solid like a rock in the shaker.The juice machine was covered with fruit flies and the lady tending to the food was rude when we accidentally dropped some food on the floor stating she would be the one cleaning it up later. The 3rd floor hall was like an ice box due to remodeling. The heater in the room did not work properly. The pool was closed for renovations.The vending machine was almost completely out of food. Thanks for a horrible experience. It will be a cold day in Hades before Holiday Inn gets my hard earned money again."
"Holiday Inn Express and Suites Exmore, Eastern Shore",4,Stay,Great Hotel! The front desk staff was very nice. Just stayed one night while travelling. Couldn't be happier!!
"Holiday Inn Express and Suites Exmore, Eastern Shore",5,"Near Virgina Tech Agriculture Farm, Painter, VA","My daughter is a student at Virginia Tech, we had traveled down to attend farm day. The hotel is close, clean, good breakfast (except the eggs, they taste weird). Gotta be aware even tho this is not a tourist area, there is a big difference between season and off-season rates, I did the same exact trip a month (june) ago and it was 40 less a night"
"Holiday Inn Express and Suites Exmore, Eastern Shore",5,Exmore nice stop over spot,"Friendly staff, nice clean room, good hot breakfast"
"Holiday Inn Express and Suites Exmore, Eastern Shore",4,good stopover heading north-south,comfortabel hotel and very good breakfast. Bathroom needed some wall repair work due to deteriorating plaster around tub.
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,4,Very clean and well kept,Good hotel in the Prince Frederick MD area. The hotel was very well maintained and our room was spotless and comfortable (although the mattresses are on the firmer side). Reasonably priced as well. Having the free breakfast buffet was a plus and a time saver.
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,3,Nice Hotel for the area.,Bathroom needed maintenance to the sink and tub was pealing. Nice furniture and room was nice. Front desk attendant was paying more attention to her phone than the customers. No bottled water available at the concessions. Ice machine broken on 2nd floor. Overall I like this Hotel was just a little disappointed in the services offered.
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,4,Location is perfect,"Ten minutes from Dares beach and 20 minutes from Chesapeake beach. The proximity to everything is second to none. The staff are amazing and they're very accommodating. The pool is small but it's useful and breakfast is your general high school breakfast. Only real negative is my sheets were stained. Regardless, I'd recommend this place."
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,2,Don't pick this place for the free breakfast.,Breakfast was awful the one time we had it. All of the days prior it was closed earlier than it was supposed to be. We were put in a room with a bucket catching a leak and then they moved us right across from the elevator where we could hear it ding all night. We won't stay here again.
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,5,Amazing Service,"Even if it was just for a night passing through, everyone was amazing. The room was clean, we were not bothered at all, the staff was very helpful when needed, everything was quiet when it shouldve been. Amazing. Will definitely come back."
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,4,good spot to stop for the wedding we attended,easy check in good breakfast clean rooms nice large bathroom
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,4,"Great value, good location.","Exactly as you would expect from Holiday Inn Express. No surprises. Solid property, staff and amenities."
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,5,Nice hotel next to main road,"Staff was very nice and helpful, room was clean..............."
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,1,Too bad,They don't cancel a reservation even when requested a week ahead of time. Be careful when you book this inn. I had to throw my money since they didn't give me a refund. TOO BAD!!!
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,5,Great for Business trip,"It was perfect for my travel needs for work. Hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly. If you stay here you have to eat at the Greene Turtle, it's a 1/4 of a mile away with great food."
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,2,terrible king size bed,"2 things are mandatory for a good hotel stay. 1. that the place is clean, and this was. 2. that the bed be comfortable and this WAS NOT!! It was a struggle to not roll into the divot that was in the center of the mattress. Both my husband and I had a terrible nights sleep."
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,4,Mini-vacation,"I was on a short mini-vacation with my granddaughters and it was an excellent choice. Our primary purpose was to visit the Chesapeake Beach Water Park, so this hotel worked out fine. Breakfast was ok, but customer service was awesome."
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,5,Very nice close to shopping and food,Very restful and quite. Also had a nice pool to relax in.
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,4,2 day business stay.,Rooms could use some updates: Beds a bit lumpy. Rugs need better cleaning. Desk in room wobbly. Chair uncomfortable. Breakfast: Eggs powdery. Staff was generally friendly and helpful.
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,3,Ok Hotel,"Disappointed with the breakfast, have to wait for food, was too slow"
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,3,Unexpected disappointment,"Had planned a family trip well in advance. Made reservation through hotels.com. Knew hotel would be full - called the evening of reservation to let them know we were about an hour out. Front desk staff was rude, said I did not reserve with charge card and was ready to give my room away - I insisted she check records. she then admitted she was wrong and the room was already paid for. Upon arrival, nobody at the front desk - had to wait. understaffed for such a busy night. once in our room, discovered they gave us a king bed for 3 adults - had to go track down a cot since there was no other room to switch to. staff was short with me and my family. said we should have known to call the front desk when making the reservation, etc. etc - pretty much blaming us for not doing a better job with making reservations. Hotel is in decline with repairs needed (broken door locks, broken gym equipment, broken machine in breakfast area, clogged toilet, broken clock in gym, filter not working in pool adequately, etc.) Housekeeping had rooms clean, but common areas needed more attention. Towels in gym and pool area were low in stock. staff in breakfast area was very attentive and pleasant. Seems more staffing/attention to detail would generally bring things back up to snuff. It is close to traffic - and right next to a fire station. Ask for a room in the back if you can!"
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,2,poor bed,The bed in room 305 had to be the worst bed I've ever slept in. NOT HAPPY. not impressed. will not be staying there or will do my best to avoid another holiday inn express.
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,5,winter layover,"easy to find ,,,,, great stay"
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,5,Great Service,Great Customer Service. Nice Place and rooms were cleaned and uptodate
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,4,Sleep is good,Nice pillows and TV. That's about all I have. Who much must I type
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,4,Good hotel for overnight stay,"The room was satisfactory. The towels were good, but the bed linen was thin and flimsy, down to the polyester base. Newer, more substantial sheets would be a big plus."
Holiday Inn Express Prince Frederick,5,Nice convenient Location,"Good location, easy access to restaurants and hospitals."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Will use again,This hotel is convenient to the metro and only a four stops from downtown Washington. It has limited shuttle service to the metro as well. My wife and I will use it again as a good alternative to the high-priced hotels downtown when feasible.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,Great room for the money.,"The hotel was lovely and the staff was great...very helpful with directons around the city. My husband, our adult daughter stayed here for the weekend. The only complaint is that the bed needs to be replaced and the sleep sofa was very short even when fully opened. The bed was very soft which caused us to roll toward the middle. The rooom was very clean and nicely appointed with a good sized flat screen TV. The AC worked well. The best part of this hotel is that if you plan to stay more than a few days, the room comes with a small kitchen that has the basics...dishes, pots, pans,etc. and a dishwasher."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,more room than we needed,But great option if you are spending a few days in DC. I would definitely stay here again.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,"Affordable hotel in Arlington, VA","This hotel is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. It is convenient, affordable, and the rooms are spacious."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Great deal in Arlington,"This hotel is a terrific value. The staff,is always great, it's clean, and it's close to things. It's appliances are a little older, but they work perfectly! I always stay here when I'm in town."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,quiet getaway from d.c.,"this beautiful hotel was as quiet, comfortable, charming and accommodating as it was beautiful. the room was all of these things and felt like a home away from home."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Comfortable and unique,"This is a beautiful hotel room. The high ceilings and dated architecture were appreciated. The suite I stayed in had all of the amenities that I would have needed (had I actually cooked there). Very nice staff. I forgot my toothpaste and within minutes housekeeping brought me a new tube. Other places I've had to go to the front desk, or they would take hours. The work out room was a little dated, but they did have a total body machine that was good to use."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",1,Great Stay,"Hotel is under renovations and you would not know it the way the staff, front desk and sales treated you. The room was great, much space. I stayed with my son and daughtger in a studio suite and were very comfortable. the hotel is located ina excellent location with easy acess to all surrondings. I would stay they again,"
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Great room for the money,"The motel was 10 min fro the metro station. It was very convenient. A safeway was about 2 blocks away, (don't go to the Prospect Market--very expensive) The room was large enough for all six of us, the kitchen was adequate and saved us a lot of money. It was good we booked through hotels.com becasue we heard a few other customers fighting with the staff over their bill. When we checked out they said we were all paid and there was our reciept. The workout room was nice, the bathroom near the workout room hadn't been remodeled yet. There is internet but it didn't work very fast, they said they were updating it. No pay for view movies, but a nice big flat screened tv. Overall I would stay there again, loved the location and the fact it had a kitchen"
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,"Virginian Suites, Arlington - VA, Spacious stay!","Never expected to get a bigger space for our family vacation. All rooms are equipped with needed things and yes, my family enjoyed every moment of the stay ar Virginian Suites. Only thing was not expected was the internet speed, it was slow, slow on that day, probably!"
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Excelente,Perto de uma estacao de metro. Transporte gratuito para o metro. Quarto enorme. Camas enormes. Cobertas confortaveis. Tudo limpissimo.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Great Place to Stay,"All round wonderful experience. From the time we got there to the time we left the staff and service was outstanding. Ryan the Guest services person who checked us in set the tone for the rest of the stay. He was extremely courteous and helpful with all our requests, offered us advice on transportation and dining in the area which was great. We ate at the Quarter Deck restaurant he recommended all three days we were there for lunch it was so good. Cant say enough good things about the Virginian Suites!!! If your looking for a nice clean place close to everything at about half the price of the hotels downtown, you have to stay at the Virginian Suites. Cant wait to go back."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,Double charged me and gave me the run around.,"I booked this hotel for one night, because I was attending a funeral. The stay was ok. Nothing bad, nothing great. However, they charged my credit card on top of already having paid through Expedia. I called eleven times to get things straightened out and left messages with three different managers. NOBODY will apologize. This was on my check-card, needless to say it messed up my balance and i couldn't even buy gas to get home!!!!!! It was hard enough with a toddler, funeral and now this!!"
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,virginian suites,Very nice. the hotel staff was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. They were so helpful. Sabine (sp) was especially helpful.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,"Great hotel, close to Metro","Came to area to visit Washington D C, Mt. Vernon and monticello without having to drive everywhere. Although we drove to mt Vernon one day and Monticello on the way home it was nice not having to drive into DC to find a place to park."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,"The Virginian Suites - Arlington, VA. - 3.5 Stars","Would rate 3.5 rather than 3.0 stars. Location boosts value. Convenient to Arlington National Cemetery. Shuttle available to Metro Station. Grocery store and restaurants nearby. Staff friendly and helpful. Although comfortable and clean, public areas, hallways and rooms are dated. Nearby stairs useful when the only two elevators are busy. Breakfast area on third floor has nice view, but included breakfast average. King suite a little smaller than expectations. Full kitchen nice, but did not use this trip. Additional daily charge for self parking. Overall, a little pricey for condition of property. Might stay again, but will run through all the available options and prices first."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,Can't beat it for the price,"Nice and clean. Decent sized TV that you can rent movies, N64 games, go online, or listen to music. Not much closet space, only get one dresser, but plenty of hanging room. Nice bathroom. Bed was comfortable, but pillows were a little stiff. Kitchen was large enough. Full sized refrigerator with freezer. They have some pots and a pan, and a broiler pan, but no cookie sheets. Plenty of utensils and glasses, and a few things like serving spoons. There's a dish washer, and they give you the detergent. Good microwave, and cabinet space. The oven wasn't the best, but good enough. Take advantage of kitchen, stuff down here is expensive. Friendly staff that was multi-lingual, but spoke English very well. I think their website said olympic sized swimming pool, but the pool was not Olympic sized. There was a lifeguard on duty, but he did not double as a pool boy so there was a good bit of leaves and stuff floating around. Overall I was very happy with the hotel and would definitely stay here again."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,"Great Place, terrible service","For the location and price this place is a diamond in the rough. It was clean, had all the amenites one would like. But do not expect any service from the staff. The hispancis who cleaned up were the most friendly, they did speak each morning. There was a buffet breakfast that was offered (for a price), we were not even told about it. My daughter found it while exploring the hotel. They run two shuttles to the metro station, neither one would detour out of their way to drop us off at Arlington National Cememtary for a funeral. As I said before the property is well keep, clean, nice and for the location and price a deal. But do not expect southern hosptality or anyone to go out of their way to do anything special for you."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,in terms of price you can not beat the location.,Location is awesome price well worth the money. The staff is very friendly and helpful.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,The Virginian,"Since we had a 7:55 a.m. flight to the West Coast, leaving from in an unfamiliar area, we chose the Virginian based on its proximity to the airport. The check in was easy, the printed directions to get to Reagan Airport were concise and re-explained verbally."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,DC Vacation,The staff was very friendly and did all they could to make our stay enjoyable.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",1,Old and Tired,"The hotel common areas look dated and worn. The room had an odor similar to old, rancid grease, especially in the kitchen. Some of the electrical outlets in the room did not work. There is no accomodation for a wheelchair to enter thru the front door. Not sure how they have avoided making the hotel wheelchair friendly. On a positive note, the bed was comfortable and the bedding was cozy."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,Good location,"The room was clean but needs maintenance, wallpaper coming off the wall in the living room area of our suite. It is an older building and bathroom did not have extra outlet for appliances such as curling iron. It was nice and convenient having the kitchen. Good location! Convenient to many of the Arlington/ DC sites."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,I Would Definitely Stay Here Again,"My stay was short...wished I could have stayed longer. Check in was fast. Staff very professional. Hotel was clean and inviting. Suite was spacious for a high rise Hotel. Expected cramped however, was pleasently surprised by it's size. Restaurant and convenience stores within walking distance. The Hotel is in a residential neighborhood, not much activity surrounding it. Although there is a fee for parking, It was the cheapest in the area."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,Very inexpensive with lots of room,"I was pleasently surprised with the quality of the room and it's location. It was quite literally 3 minutes drive time from the Washington Monument and 10 minutes walk time from the metro. The staff was very helpful and the room large. It had a mini kitchen complete with stove, fridge microwave and sink. If I needed an inexpensive place to stay in DC for the week and didn't want to have to eat out every night this would be the place. It's age was showing, carpet stains, peeling wallpaper etc, but the staff was excellent and the rooms very comfortable. No one's home is perfect and this hotel isn't either, but if you are looking for a nice place to stay and can handle it not being absolutely perfect you'll be very happy with Virginian Suites."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Would definitely go back.,"Good parking lot size at hotel - no problems finding a spot for me. Hotel had a Tues night guest reception which was well attended the night I went...had food and drinks there. Hotel is older, but very clean. Front desk and all of staff was very accomodating and pleasant. Room was like an apt in size/good kitchen set up. I extended my stay for 2 extra nights. I felt very safe for a single woman traveler. Would probably be a good place to stay for families or groups as well."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",2,Old and dirty,"Stayed 2 double beds suite for 2 nights. The location is good however, it was not worth for almost 200/ night. Overall, this hotel is so old..it needs some update on furniture, carpet, kitchen and bathroom. Bathroom was so small and dirty hairs on the bathtub and spider webs on ceiling... Carpet and furniture were so old and sticky. Gas stove wasn't working. Pots and cooking utensils seems like it's from someone's garbage. We booked this hotel for kitchen but we had to go out to eat...and there is only 1 restaurant near by..."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Excellent sevice. Can't wait to go back.,We felt like home. We are planning to go back in the near future. The staff is very polite. Viginia Suites is within walking distance from mass transit and that make it easy to travel to the main atractions in Washington D.C. We highly recommend Virginia Suites to any one planning to visit Washington.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,simple hotel that meets all your needs,"I highly recommend this hotel as a place to stay. It's situated in Arlington a quieter,more idealic area than Washington dc itself although still very easy to visit all the attractions in DC via a short walk to Rosslyn, it's nearest metro.Hotel room was amazing value for money,very clean with a separate kitchen area.There is no hotel restaurant available and thekitchen was more than adequate to cook decent meals in. Our only complaint is that our gas cooker did not work and after mentioning it to the hotel it was never sorted out so we spent 2 weeks without a working cooker.As there is not much in the surrounding area we found ourselves having to travel into rosslyn and Washington to buy dinner."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,Good enough for a quick overnite stay.,The staff was very helpful. The room was comfortable but not clean enough. The rest of the hotel was also lacking.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Great for exploring Washington.,"This hotel more than met our expectations, very close to the metro station, 5-10 mins walk, but a free shuttle bus operates anyway so you don't have to walk. Very close to Washington and Arlington Cemetery. The neighbourhood felt safe and we had no fear of walking out even late at night, highly recommended."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,Good Service and Comfortable Rooms,"This is a good value in a suite-type hotel. Good location near Rosslyn, friendly staff and spacious rooms."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Hotel much better than I though,"I first read the reviews of this hotel on this site and mostly all said great things about this hotel and i can see why. When you first get here it does't look or seem like your ordinary hotel from the outside. However, The Hotel hostess were extremely nice, The room was awesome, the bed slept great, room was comfort and cosey, if i decided to cook in the kitchen i could have. Great area, and you can walk to Iwo Jima memorial, or walk to Rosslyn area to eat. I will return with fam friends in spring time....."

"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,Satisfactory Accommodations,We were satisfied with our accommodations but were surprised by a 9 parking fee. We were not aware of the fee before hand and this should be disclosed when booking the hotel.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,Good location - 10 minute walk to Metro,Came Memorial day weekend. Great weather.Enjoyed Rolling Thunder. Visited many venues.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",2,Snobby North East attitudes,"They charged me 150 for smoking in my room. I do not smoke. There was one person who did smoke in the room, at a wimdow, window were left open. As a non smoker I can smell when a room has been smoked in. The room had NO smoking odor. A small fee for breaking the rules would have been acceptbale. They were unfair about it."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,Good price for the location,"The location is great, about 10 minutes' walk from Rosslyn Metro. Environment good too. The only thing I dislike is the check in time. Their standard check-in time is 3:00pm, but we actually cannot check-in until 3:40pm. Hotel staff kept telling us it would be 20 or 10 more minutes, but we waited from 1:00pm until 3:40pm. Not a good experience. The room and corridor had cigarette smell, even though we selected Smoke Free room. The blank has a big cut on it. House cleaning lady sometimes left a piece of paper on the floor even though we left 2 dollars as tip. Guess she might not be satified with us. Overall, the place is not a bad selection. I vote for the location and price."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Convenient to sightseeing,Short stay and close to metro. The hotel shuttle to the metro station was great.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,"Very Nice Hotel, Great Value","We had a very positive experience at this hotel. Our party (2 adults, 2 teenagers) had plenty of room to spread out. We had a pull-out sofa sleeper, roll-away bed, kitchenette, and queen-sz. bed. There was a large dressing area off the bathroom, a great place for suitcases, etc. The furniture was contemporary and new, beds were very comfortable. This hotel is very close to Arlington Cemetery, and the Rosslyn Metro stop was a five minute walk away. They also have a shuttle to the metro. The people at the desk were very responsive to all our needs."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,Good suite but slightly dated,Staff were friendly. The suite was of good size and very practically arranged. The shuttle to and from the metro worked very reliably (about every 10 to 15 minutes).
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Great Experience,The Virginian Suites is a great hotel with an extremely friendly and helpful staff.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,Good value for the price.,"Reasonably priced, average accommodations, excellent staff, good location."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,"cheaper than downtown, basic amenities","Opted to stay here and commute to downtown for my meetings to save on hotel expenses of the downtown hotels. If you are willing to do that, it works. hotel has basic amenities, nothing more. It's basically a highrise motel...rooms are all suites with stove, microwave,etc. 10-15 minute walk to metro. Shuttle operates only on weekdays."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,"Good Location, Poor Maintenence, Free Breakfast was Absolutely Pathetic",Thats it
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,"Virginian Suites er et hotel, hvor vi har flt os","Der har ikke vret noget at klage over. Virginian Suites har indeholdtog budt p de tjenesteydelser, vi selv har fordret. Derfor har vi vret srdeles godt tilfreds. Derfor faldt valget ogs p Virginian Suites, da vi p tilbagevejen p vores rejse skulle finde logi for de sidste 2 dage."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,"Great location, comfortable rooms","You can walk to Arlington Cemetary the Iwo Jima Memorial from the hotel, as well as to a supermarket restaurants. The hotel shuttle was very reliable, running in the morning afternoon Mon-Fri to from the Metro station once a day to the supermarket. The suites were large, with a pull-out sofa in every room. It wasn't the most comfortable, but it was great to have a separate bedroom area full kitchen. The only thing I was suprised at was the fact that we had to lift our heavy luggage up about 5 steps to get to the elevators. There were no ramps. From the parking lot, it's a straight shot through the front doors of the main entrance. I saw some people arrive by bus, which dropped them off on a side street. They were dragging their luggage up about 30 stairs to get to the parking lot! Instead, they could've just walked around along the street in front of the hotel to get to the lot. Going up all those stairs with luggage did not look fun!"
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Leisure Trip - Comfortable Stay,I stayed here during my trip to DC on the Memorial Day weekend. I found this hotel very clean and comfortable. It is close to the Metro Station (5-10 min walk or 5 by cab) which is a big plus. Good neighbourhood. No Room service but lots of reasonable options to order from. Super nice room with kitchen. Didnt use much of the hotel services but found this place worth the money I spent. I didnt face any issues during my stay and would recommend this to my friends.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,Good location,"IF your looking for an affordable place close to DC this is the perfect place. It was convenient with 2 children to have a kitchen and a little extra room. The hotel offers a shuttle to the metro station but we found the walk to be pleasant and only 10 minutes away. There aren't any restaurants nearby so you either have to plan in advance or order food to be delivered. Another added benefit is the free parking, and plenty of it. I would probably stay again, if only for the location."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",2,Virginian Suites,The hotel was nice but a bit old. The air conditioning did not work well in either of the rooms in which we stayed. In the evening we were told breakfast was available in the hotel. In the morning we were told our rooms did not include breakfast and it appeared that only high end rooms quailfied for breakfast. So we had to leave the hotel to eat. Over all I was dissatisfied and would not stay at this hotel again.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Nice place to stay,S
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Great place to stay. Convenient. Great price.,"I'm very satisfied with my 6 nights stay with the hotel. Very close to the metro. The room is huge, clean and comfortable. The kitchen with a microwave, fridge, range, cooking utensils and plates, is a plus. The staff is friendly.I highly recommend this hotel."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Nice hotel.,"I chose this hotel because it already had a very good rating and it is fairly close to DC. The staff are really helpful and there is a shuttle bus to and from the metro system. The room was clean, in very nice condition and everything worked well."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,"Great service, good location, BIG rooms.",Brought my sister and brother in law from south Africa here and its location and comfort just wowed them. The longer you stay the more convenient that kitchen becomes.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",1,No consideration for the customer,"I was told at check in there is a 7.00 per day charge for your vehicle for parking. I did not mind this but it is not explained to you on the information of the hotel when booking. The real problem I had was that I had absolutely no hot water to shower with in the morning when I was getting ready for work. I called the front desk and received NO consideration at all. I am a vietnam veteran and I swore I would never take another cold shower so I had to go to work without bathing. NOT FUN!!!!!!!!!!! I paid for breakfast when I reserved the room but I did not receive any coupon at check in and was not told I needed one. After getting dressed, I went to the breakfast area but was not allowed in because I did not have a coupon. I WAS SO UPSET AT THIS POINT THAT I JUST CHECKED OUT AND LEFT. I expressed my feelings to the front desk and they said they could not do anything for me because no one from mainteanace was at work yet. This all happened between 5:45 AM and 6:30 AM"
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Great rooms,"The rooms are very nice. Large flatscreen TV, kitchen...more like a small apartment than a hotel room. Only bad thing was that it's not super close to restaurants or bars. Other than that though, it's a great deal for the price, and very close to the metro."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,Great room for the price,"I stayed at the Virginian Suites for one night in February and I was overall impressed with the hotel. It's a little difficult to get to if you don't know the area, but it's very convenient to restaurants and Georgetown, it would probably be a nice walk in the spring/summer. I stayed in a studio suite and there was a full kitchen with dishes and cooking utensils and it was very clean. There was a flat screen tv and couch. (A bit uncomfortable though). The bed was comfortable with high quality sheets. The bathroom was clean, but a bit small. There is a lot of storage and a large closet, so it would be a good place to stay for an extended period of time. The staff was very attentive, and the Washington Post was delivered in the morning. The only complaints I have are that the internet password did not work (though I'm sure this could have been fixed had I bothered to call the front desk), the small bathroom, and the fact that you have to pay for parking (7 a night). Other than that, I definitey recommend this hotel!"
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,Great room for the money,"I had a very nice stay at the Virginian Suites. They are remodeling the hotel, and you can really tell by the quality of the room. It was very modern, clean, and comfortable. My only complaints are thus- the hotel is extremely difficult to find. I suppose that's not the hotel's fault, it is a very confusing area of town anyways. Also, I was not aware that I would have to pay 7 extra dollars for parking. Just wish I would have been aware of this ahead of time. I would, however, stay there again."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Nice time,Excellent travel and it was a relax place to visit
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,best experience I have ever had,people with solid schedules moving toward success don't have time for this much detail to you
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Home away from home,We had an extremely pleasant stay at the Virginian Suites Hotel. Like staying in an apartment it was so spacious. The hotel is convenient to everything and within walking distance to the metro which I did because the traffic was so bad most mornings I could beat the hotel transport. Everything was clean and they even have a breakfast. We would stay here again. Also very quiet for sleeping.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,"Updates are great, but somethings were skipped","This hotel recently went through an update in regards to the furniture and televisions. I have to say that they did a great job. They didn't. however, replace the tile in the bathrooms to match the rest of the updates, which is a shame. The tub and pedestal sink looked new, but the toilet did not. But I have to say, that the bathroom was the cleanest I have ever seen. Not even one stray hair on the floor! The kitchen also skipped the update, but it was still nice to have a fridge, microwave and stove. All the essential items like utensils, dinnerware and cookware were stocked in the cabinets. Also, there is no wi-fi in the rooms, you have to go to the lobby. There is only a plug for high speed internet located in the room. The hotel is a great bargain for staying near D.C. and I would stay there in a heartbeat."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Felt very safe...,"A single parent traveling with two children. I felt very safe. This hotel centrally located to everything. The room was very well kept. This hotel does not rate on the same scale as a five star hotel, but it does rate 5 stars for the kitchen facility, pool area and friendliness of staff. Book with confidence."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,Good for the price in the area,"The stay was adequate but the hotel was dark inside. First thing that hit us when entering the room was a strong odor of some sort of freshener. When going over the essentials, it did not have any toothpaste. Although the staff is very nice, we requested toothpaste 4 times within 3 hours before it was finally delivered. Still, the stay was adequate for the price we paid in this area."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,Great stay,"our only complaint is that the hotel staff were not very knowledgeable about the area couldn't give us directions. Also, there is no food nearby or in the hotel."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,very close to DC,"I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Very close to downtown DC. Clean hotel, friendly staff, good rate. Large rooms. Great experience."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,No cherry blossoms,Clean. Friendly staff. Very large rooms. Highly recommend.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,A recommendation for the Virginian Suites,"My wife and I stayed at the Virginian Suites for 8 days in October. Overall, it was a very enjoyable stay. The only drawbacks were the lumpy pillows and the dripping bathtub (it was in another room, however, and was not a distraction except when one was in the bathroom). We brought it to the attention of the staff as we checked out and they said they would send someone up to look at it. The hotel setting is lovely - just a short walk to a lovely park and the Iwo Jima memorial in Arlington Cemetary. There are two restaurants within a five minute walk of the hotel and leftovers can easily be kept and reheated in the suite's compact kitchen. There is ample parking on the premises for automobiles and the hotel shuttle makes morning and evening runs to the nearest metro station (which is walkable in a pinch) and will take you to the grocery store as well. The suites are large and comfortable and we will probably use them again if we return to Washington."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,"Good value, nice room","Good value compared to the hotels downtown DC. Good room, and good service."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Nice Place to Stay,"This hotel was a bit older but very well maintained. The room was spacious with a separate full kitchen and a walk-in closet. There was zero noise from elevators or guests above or next door, unlike many newer hotels we've stayed in. Our only complaint was that the place was a bit difficult to find after dark - the sign is not high enough to be easily visible. In daylight, we discovered it was extremely easy to travel right next door to the Arlington Cemetary or across the Arlington Bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, etc. The price was very reasonable and we would definitely stay here again."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",1,NOT IMPRESSED,Coffee Pot Leaks and does not make HOT coffee. Had to request Toilet Paper TWICE. NOT the Worst we've stayed but FAR FROM THE BEST for that price.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Gerne wieder,sehr gut gelegenes Hotel.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,A Good Location Hotel,"Arrived at the Hotel from Dulles airport at 15:50 the young man on the reception who introduced himself as B was at once friendly and welcoming and made a good first impression. The hotel although a bit dated is clean and easy to get around, the room I was in was spacious and with the benefit of it's own kitchen a blessing after a long day sight seeing. A shuttle bus runs frequently to and from the hotel to Rosslyn Metro station and the driver helpful and friendly, although if the weather is nice a walk down the hill is to Rosslyn and the Metro is no more than 10 minutes. All in all a good hotel and location with easy access to Washington DC."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,Pretty good for the cost compared to DC prices,"PRO -The room was very clean, but old which was consistent with many review I read prior to booking. -The cost was reasonable for the location. -The location was convenient CON Some upgrades were needed, such as: -an exhaust fan for the bathroom - the steam would condense on the ceiling where some mold/mildew and grown, and this liquid mixture would drip down from the ceiling. -the high speed wireless internet was slow and intermittent. My iPhone constantly dropped the signal or could not find it at all. I ran a speed check and the results showed a download speed of 1.39 Mbps and an upload speed of 0.34 Mbps. Perhaps this is high speed in some countries, but in the DC area, I consider this to be quite slow. It was complimentary, however, where other places have a surcharge for internet access. -There was no thermostat for HVAC so the room would go from warm to cool based on the control dial on the unit which was not temperature calibrated, but was simply warmer/cooler. -The elevators were small and slow, but functional. -The 6.00 breakfast did not include eggs or bacon. I hoped for a better meal for the money. Choices included coffee, juice, cereal, milk, sweet rolls, and packaged pancakes. I did not try the pancakes. There may have been other similar choices, but there were no more substantial choices as I recall. The preparation area was quite congested. I might stay there again, but I would not get the breakfast or stay in a room with bathroom mildew."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,"Close, Comfortable, and Affordable","My recent three day stay at the Virginian Suites in Arlington was pleasant enough, but it could have been so much better if the facility was simply updated with some relatively minor interior design modifications that would give it a fresh 2014 look. Adding some color to the walls, fabrics finishes, and beginning the process of incremental replacement of furnishings would elevate the hotel to the next level without breaking the bank, and allow the hotel to keep its very affordable rates intact. The location was great, in that it was a short walk or drive to much of Arlington's riverfront, the downtown commercial center, the METRO station, and the Key Bridge and Georgetown. The hotel is located on 1 mile from Interstate 66, so vehicular access was great. The beds were very comfortable, but the rooms were underwhelming from a design standpoint. The only problem I encountered was that air conditioning unit seemed a bit undersized. Overall, it was a very nice place to sleep, and I would stay there again, especially if cost were an issue."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,Needs Improvement,WE stayed at the Washington DC site and the staff was not accomidating to people who had never been in the DC area before. We asked for direction and way of getting around and they were very disinterested in helping us (there were 9 of us). When we went down to the continental breakfast we were asked where our coupon for brekfast was we asked if our room key would do she said no. We went down to the front desk got the coupon went back up and she said okay you have it but NEVER even looked at it we could have shown her a fake card she would have never have known she jsut made it inconfience for us to eat. Beware that if they say you can walk somewhere that it will only take you 20 minutes plann for 45 to hour they have no sense of time or distance.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Great Stay!,"We enjoyed our stay at this suite hotel. The entire staff was very helpful and accommodating. The AC unit in our room needed repair, and within 5 minutes, a maintenance staff member promptly arrived and had it fixed within 30 minutes! The front desk staff were extremely helpful with directions to transportation, local grocery stores within walking distance, even printing our boarding passes for our flight home! Thank you all!"
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,Good stay for the money,Convenient location to BART very big room outfitted with kitchette.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Perfect Place to stay close to Washington DC,"This was a convenient place to stay and then ride the Metro (only 1 mile walk) into DC to see the sights. The quality and value of the hotel were outstanding. I loved having a suite, it made us feel at home. The housekeeping staff was awesome. I called and requested extra towels and coffee and they brought them within 5 minutes."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,Good place for families,"Traveling with two kids under 7. Hotel room was spacious with a full kitchen. Not the newest place, small bathroom but overall excellent for kids."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",1,Terrible experience,"What a terrible experience. I reserved and prepaid through Hotels.com. I arrived close to midnight because of flight delays and was informed that the hotel was overbooked and that they had moved me to a hotel in Alexandria - 20 minutes away. I received no phone call, email or contact either from the Hotel or Hotels.com. The hotel they moved me too was in no way an equivalent hotel (half the price and they wouldn't refund me the difference which required me to through a fairly efficient but inconvenient process to call Hotels.com and request a refund), incredibly inconvenient and they also made me pay for a second cab to get there. I would not recommend unless there was absolutely no alternative. The night manager was at least friendly and sympathetic but powerless to do anything."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",3,Caution - Pick this hotel for the correct reasons,"Good - Large, essentially one-bedroom apartments. Bad - Aged, and poorly designed. The soft shell of the tub enclosure dipped between the joists when I stood in it. Good - Nice neighborhood. Bad - practically impossible to get a cab on time. Good - housekeeping staff goes out of their way. Bad - Front desk is horrible. They lack procedure, training and capability. Simple tasks were challenging. Don't count on getting a cab through the front desk unless you have 30-60 minutes to wait for one. Call the cab company yourself and make certain they have your name so some other frustrated customer doesn't take your cab. Good - they run a shuttle from the hotel to the Metro. Bad - there is no schedule and you have to look carefully for when they don't run, when they are doing a grocery store run, or when they are running to another facility they service. The Metro is across the street and down half a block from where they drop you off and pick you up. Since you don't know the schedule, you're standing on the street waiting. Dress appropriately and take an umbrella. There is no restaurant in the building. But there is a call in service which delivers food from many restaurants. I recommend this hotel IF you have your own car, are flexible about the age of the building, and don't rely on any services from the front desk."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,A Good Value,Close to Arlington Cemetery (15-20 minute walk)and Metro (10 min walk). Hotel is an older building but suitable for it's 2.5 star rating. Hi-speed internet in room was nice.
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,I'd stay at the Virginian again.,"Spent 3 nights. Very large rooms and full kitchen that is separate from the bedroom which is important, since you do not hear the refrigerator. On Wednesday, Oct. 21 they had all you can eat complimentary pizza."
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",4,Great value!,"We had a great time. Everyone was friendly. That being said, breakfast was cold and the eggs were fake. Coffee was good thoigh. Also we could not control the temperature of the room. Room was clean and spacious. Location was excellent!"
"The Virginian Suites, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member",5,Best Hotel for the Money,"The rooms are HUGE. Parking is the cheapest I've seen at any hotel in Arlington. It isn't right in the city, but it is definitely worth the cab (or hotel shuttle ride) into downtown. Always extremely clean. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I really can't say enough. This was my sixth time staying at the Virginian Suites and I keep coming back. Love it!"
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,3,It was ok...,It was ok. Was not worth the price but we waited til the last minute to book and that's what you get.
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,3,room subpar,The room had a Mildew smell and was not very clean but had fresh sheets. Breakfast was a little skeptical so grabbed a coffee and ran
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,3,Good for 1 or 2 nights,"We made a last minute reservation because of location and price (which at 157 a night wasn't really a bargain) for this hotel. The location is great, you can walk to some shops and eateries. It is a short drive or bike ride to the beach which is nice. Our first room had a faulty air conditioner and the room was super musty. That being said, the hotel staff was GREAT and got us another room. They continued to be really helpful and friendly throughout the stay. The room was really tight for a 5 night stay and I'd only recommend this for 1 maybe 2 nights tops. The pool was clean and the free breakfast was so/so. Other than the staff, I probably wouldn't stay here again..."
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,4,Great stay even without seeing the Pony Penning,"Short stay, but very enjoyable. The management and staff were very courteous and informative. Sorry to have missed the Pony Penning, but did see some on Assateague Island nearby."
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,1,SLEEPER BEWARE!!,"This was the WORST hotel experience I have ever experienced in my 47 years walking the face of this Earth. The hotel room was egregiously small, the beds were sunken in the middle, the pillow cases, linens, bed spreads and blankets were all filthy, the room had the stench of heavy cigarette smoke, the front desk LIED to me about not having any other rooms available and, to top it off, they still charged my credit card for a two-night stay despite me not even staying 15 minutes. I told the front desk that I was not staying and found somewhere else to stay and they told me that I would not give a refund despite the horrible and horrific conditions mentioned above. Lousy customer service. I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone except the police. And, I would only recommend it to the police in order for them to arrest and file charges against hotel staff for theft -- for charging my credit card when I did not even stay at the hotel."
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,3,"New owners, same motel","The main features of this property are its close proximity to the beach and comparatively low price. The rooms are small and a tad cramped, and feel a little damp and musty, even with the (old) AC units running all day. But the beds and facilities were OK, the staff were all very courteous and helpful, and there was a reasonable hot breakfast on the premises. It was good for three nights, but we wouldn't want to have stayed longer."
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,4,Bueno.,"The room was comfortable, breakfast was terrible, the service is until 09:30 and 9:00 there is nothing and stay without breakfast. Many people do not breakfasted."
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,3,Ok but not worth the price,"The location was fine since everything on the island is a short trip away. But the room smelled of spray disinfectant and was extremely small it didn't even have a closet although it had everything else it was jammed in there. Actually everything was jammed in, they did not have a separate area for the breakfast it was set up in the lobby which is small as well and which you had to walk back and forth to four separate sections to get to as people are checking in and out and leaving for the day. Even the hallways were small and you had to squeeze around the cleaning carts or move them. I will say they use every space available they can. The pool was nice and the staff as well although it seemed disorganized. I didn't hate my stay but i felt i was overcharged."
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,4,"Quiet location, good value","This was a business trip and I found the hotel occupied by business people as well as families. Staff was very friendly and accommodating, on all shifts. Bed was comfortable. My room was taken care of nicely except for one day when the bed was not made (I didn't mention it to the desk clerk). Breakfast was set up late every day (after 7 a.m. although the sign says 7:00 and I was told it is actually 6 to 6:30 and all the hot items required microwaving, so early birds can't really eat and run. It was impossible to control the heat, cool and humidity in the room but I understand a renovation is scheduled so I imagine that will correct that situation. Price was right. Overall, I would stay in this property again."
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,1,Should have been closed while under construction,"Filthy outside grounds with construction debris, cat litter, plastic bags, and garbage. Inside lobby was under construction breakfast was in a storage room with no place to eat. Hotel staff was overheard telling others to Shut your mouth. Reception was not manned had to wait 15 minutes for check-in and longer for check-out before staff arrived.."
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,1,would not recommend,"Arrived to find our room had a broken air-conditioner, the shower curtain rod was coming out of the drywall and the bathroom fan sounded like a jack hammer. the maintenance person could not fix the AC, there were no other rooms available, the windows did not open and it was like an over in the room. The staff did not offer to pay for us to room elsewhere etc due to the inconvenience. I would not recommend this facility. It was in disrepair. And as we were standing at the desk, a couple with 3 small children came in with a confirmation email and there reservation had been cancelled, so they had no room at all."
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,3,could have been better,"Hotel not well maintained. Lack of staffing. Missing ceiling tiles in hallways, lights out, cleaning staff does only what they have too. No maintenance staff on site. 1st room we had bath fan sounded like it was going to fall apart, room had dirt in corners and behind curtains. 2nd room we had: toilet was loose and rocked, air conditioner had mildew around the sides. Walls in hotel are thin can hear people next door and above. Parking lot not paved."
Days Inn Chincoteague Island,5,Sensational Staff,This was my second visit to the Island and second stay at Days Inn. The staff is friendly and helpful which is why I will definitely return!!
Hampton Inn-lincolnton,5,Very nice 3 day stay,"Overall, the quality of my 3 day stay was good.

The breakfast was descent and the hotel is conveniently located. Would stay there again!"
Super 8-wytheville,4,Great Value!,"Convenient location to a delicious steakhouse next door, comfy pillows, and friendly service. Will definitely stay again!"
Super 8-wytheville,2,Super 8 suffices in a pinch,"Pleasant check in, room.smelled.like stale smoke, a few dead bugs on the Floor and had to go through a swarm.to enter the room. There were red stains on.the door that seemed odd..dead bugs Building is fairly.dated but room was updated except.for the bed condition. It was not comfortable at all. The shower was good, hot and strong. Breakfast was very nice and goes until 10am. they needed more seating though for guests. Not a bad hotel..would.probably choose a different one next time."
Residence Inn Naples,5,Great stay,"The Residence Inn in Naples was a great place to stay in Naples.

Hampton Inn & Suites Tulsa South-bixby,2,Hilton Hamptons Slowest internet of any brand,"I use the net for work and this Hampton inn has theirs set so slow it is unusable.

Super 8 Alton,3,Expedia doesn't care,"I reserved a room that turned out to be designed for a handicapped person, with all the fixtures, closet rods, ironing board, desks, etc., being much too low for my comfort. I was not made aware, in advance that the room was so designed. I am 6'4, so the accommodations were unusually uncomfortable for me. I was offered another room, but the hotel was unable to change my room due to it being reserved and paid via Expedia. I contacted Customer Service, and it is now 21 days, and I have yet to receive a response. I paid for 3 days, but only stayed for 2, as the accommodations were just unacceptable. I spent my last night at a competing hotel for about the same price, without issue. Of course I did not reserve that room via Expedia."
Super 8 Alton,1,Please don't stay here,"I checked in and this room was literally disgusting. We checked in, and checked back out in 10 minutes. I could never sleep at a place like this.

Best Western Premier The Central Hotel & Conference Center,5,Great Place,This is my second stay at this hotel and it is even better than the first time. The rooms are comfortable and the stay was great. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The Irish Pub on premises is a great asset.

Best Western Premier The Central Hotel & Conference Center,2,Spoke Too Soon,Stayed here back in October and planned a wonderful review. I spoke too soon. Of the four couples who stayed here (in our group) only 1 couple did NOT have extra charges placed on his/her credit card. Each of the extra charges were traced back to this hotel - - - for NON-hotel expenses. Luckily my credit card company knows... More
Best Western Premier The Central Hotel & Conference Center,4,Good Value,"Large room with comfortable king bed and sofa for less than 100. Clean bathroom. Large, lovely lobby.

The restaurant is average for dinner, but serves the best breakfast I've had in a hotel (ordered from the menu). The pancakes still haunt my dreams! The room had a number of maintenance issues, which were promptly addressed by the hotel as much as possible. I... More"

If I ever need a hotel again, anywhere near Harrisburg... I will definitely be staying here."
Best Western Premier The Central Hotel & Conference Center,4,Nice facility,Attended a conference here this past weekend. Hotel is not too far off the PA turnpike. Near some local shopping. Free parking. They have an onsite restaurant. Banquet food was rather good. Rooms clean and nice size. Only thing I did not like was the room service dirty dishes that sat in the hallway all weekend.
Best Western Premier The Central Hotel & Conference Center,5,Surprisingly impressed!,"I had my reservations about this hotel. Being new with a company and having to share a room for a training, I was very hesitant and unsure of a number of things. I got here, checked in and was impressed with the lobby, beautiful!

Best Western Premier The Central Hotel & Conference Center,5,A Wonderful Stay At The Best Western Premier,Let me start by saying how sorry I am that this took so long to be placed on tripadvisor.

Upon our late arrival I had set the... More

Best Western Old Mill Inn,3,Just Okay,"The Best Western Old Mill has been renovated and looks much nicer than previous years. The rooms were nice and clean, but were very small and crowded with furniture. The pool was just okay and there were no clean towels. The hot tub was lukewarm the entire time we were there and there was THICK ring of mold around the top of the hot tub."
Best Western Old Mill Inn,3,Staff was great.,Staff was great. Room was fairly clean only we would not sit on the sofa...many stains on cushions. When checking room before we left and found a pizza box in refrigerator that we did not put in there. Will do in a pinch
Best Western Old Mill Inn,4,Old mill,Nice big room. Was difficult to get to at first but overall a good start.
Best Western Old Mill Inn,3,Decent if you're getting a reduced rate,"These rooms are great if you're in town for a limited purpose, ie (business trip, seeing friends or family, etc). However, I don't recommend if you're looking for something fancy or romantic. It's a very old building and a little run-down. I wasn't wild about the location either. It's tucked away and kind of hard to get to if you're not familiar with the area. If you can get a deal through one of those sites out there, do it but it's definitely not worth what they tell you over the phone."
Best Western Old Mill Inn,3,hard to get to,"pool needs cleaning , ring around the pool"
Bricktown Hotel & Convention Center,5,We have now visited Bricktown Hotel on,"We have now visited Bricktown Hotel on several occasions. The service has always been friendly, the shuttle is prompt and service oriented. As a family, we have enjoyed the pool. As a group of friends, we have taken full advantage of the Bricktown nightlife without having to drive. As a businessman, I have used the Hotel as an incentive to employees and as a TE for clients. I have referred many friends who consider this self to be a Gold Mine."
Bricktown Hotel & Convention Center,5,The nicest attitude from the Manager to,"The nicest attitude from the Manager to front desk and room assistance. The shuttle driver was pleasant and very helpful. Not only did he suggest places to eat, and take us to the place of our choice, it was the best Italian restaurant ever. He also made sure we saw the Memorial to the bombing victims both in daylight and after dark. Not to be missed!! Room was clean, fresh, completely stocked with amenities, and the bed was comfortable. I look forward to finding a reason to go back to Oklahoma City and the Knights Inn at Bricktown Hotel."
Bricktown Hotel & Convention Center,4,"Bricktown Central Plaza Hotel is Impressed, totally!","A trip to Oklahoma City wasnt really part of my vacation itinerary, but being from the neighboring state me and two of my friends decided to check out OKC anyway. For some reason we zeroed in on Bricktown Hotel, but boy, did we make the right decision! It was just awesome. We were kind of budget travelers, but we got more than we expected. The friendly staff and the great room facilities really impressed us, as did the great summer weather that greeted us whenever we went exploring the city. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfast too. OKC really made us feel welcome, and Bricktown was just rocking. But were it not for Bricktown Hotel, I wonder whether wed have had such a marvelous time."

Schooner Creek Resort,2,Spend the extra cash and go else where.,"Although the view was very nice, the efficiency room facing the cove left a lot to be desired. There were only 3 forks and one butter knife in the drawer, nothing sharp enough for a grilled steak so that plan was scrapped. The room was miniscule and not very clean. There was mold on the inside of the fridge along... More"
Econo Lodge,2,Get what you pay for,The members at desk were very nice but if your a clean freak then i wouldnt recommend staying here. maybe if all you plan on doing is getting some rest because the shower and floor isnt in great condition.

Tropicana Motel,3,Very dated property with limited services,"We stayed here on the last night of a cycling trip from Jax Beach to Sarasota, FL.

Tropicana Motel,1,Keep driving...almost anything would be better,"We stayed in this place 2 years ago. We were in the front building and paid about 70.

Hampton Inn Suites Lake Mary At Colonial Townpark,2,Mr and Mrs,"Our priority hotel is Hampton because it has been in the past clean and the bedding is claimed to be laundered after each guest. The Hampton in Lake Mary , Florida was not up to standard. The bathroom floor was filthy."

Hampton Inn Suites Fort Myers-Colonial Blvd.,4,Decent hotel,"Generally the room was nice. However, the a/c unit in the room did not cool adequately and the iron sprayed/steamed rusty water.

Pousada Suites,4,Convenient location,"The 1 asset of this motel is its proximity to the beach which is just one block away. The room was quite large and included cable TV and a kitchen.

Holiday Inn Express Grove City (Outlet Center),4,Good hotel near shopping,"Stayed here with 3 girlfriends white we shopped at the outlet mall. Front desk is very accommodating, the food is good, beds are comfortable and rooms are clean. The towels are crummy - small starchy - I would bring my own if I stayed again"
Best Western Country Inn,4,Decent Accomodations,I like staying at Best Westerns because I can count on a clean room and the right accommodations. The reason I give this one four instead of five circles is because the room looked like it needed a little maintenance. But it was clean. They have a free breakfast included with your stay from 6 am to 10 am.
Best Western Country Inn,2,Waste of Good Money,This location was little more than a hotel 6 at 4 times the cost. Very disappointed with the accommodations. I choose Best Western as they have always been a great hotel...not this time. There seemed to be a bit of attitude because this is the wine country There are a lot of choice...choose wisely.
Best Western Country Inn,3,A bit expensive for Temecula,"They tried to put us right next door to a bank of rooms they were remodeling - mattresses and carpet rolls in the hallway, men working until very late, etc. We were there for just one night for new years eve to be close to wineries. Good location for that but a little pricey just because of the day. Nothing special but adequate for what we needed."
Best Western Country Inn,3,Temecula Best Western,"Stayed one night at this Best Western for a half marathon the next morning. Overall, hotel gave the impression of being slightly dingy and outdated and was the type of hotel where all the rooms are accessed from an outdoor hallway. The service was friendly and helpful and the room was relatively clean and comfortable enough. Some stains on the carpet at the door though. Did not eat the breakast since we were up early for the race but I saw at check in that the dining room spilled out into the lobby which I thought was a little crowded looking to say the least. Great location as it was close to the plethora of wineries nearby and also close to several shopping and dining areas. Close to major highways without being noisy too. Next time I'd search for a slightly nicer hotel but this visit was satisfying for our needs."
Best Western Country Inn,5,Great stay!,"Nothing to complain about. Very friendly staff and loved it! Diana and Taylor were very helpful. Breakfast was great. Bacon, eggs, hasbrowns, waffles! It was a wonderful experience. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!"
Best Western Country Inn,2,No hot water and staff could care less,Room musty and not well ventilated. No hot water in show despite multiple trips to the front desk to ask for assistance or another room. Front desk staff asked if I turned the knob the opposite way Hotel staff made no effort to move us to another room or fix the problem. Will not be staying here again.
Hampton Inn & Suites Fremont,3,How is this a Hampton inn,"Ok, the room was clean. Spacious. Weird design where the bathroom door was a slider Desks attached to the wall covering the electrical outlets Appliances not plugged in...the refrigerator! No light bulbs in the fixtures Cleaning service doesn't remove the used coffee grounds"
Hampton Inn & Suites Fremont,4,Another great Hampton Inn,"Breakfast staff is second to none, finally someone who is pleasant and truly helpful and a pleasure to be around. He was one of the few I have ever seen that didn't have a grumpy attitude and felt like every thing you did he watched and made you feel bad if you made a mess. superstar!!!"
Hampton Inn & Suites Fremont,4,Reliable as Ussual,"the hotel was clean, very quite, and the front desk staff during check in was extremely helpful.

Meadowlands Plaza Hotel,4,"Friendly staff, great breakfast, good location","I spent five nights in the hotel with my husband and our two boys.

Meadowlands Plaza Hotel,3,A-OK for a one nighter,A good basic if not a bit dated hotel for a one night business trip no complaints and a good value for the price.
Meadowlands Plaza Hotel,4,Customer service at its finest.,I drove 9 hours from NC and happened to arrive eight hours before check in time . However I called the hotel and they let me check in hours earlier than I was scheduled to. Great customer service . Will be staying here again! The free breakfast is pretty great too!
Concord Suites,5,Concord Cafe is the best in Avalon!!!,"Great menu, service and the food was superb. The Seafood Pescatore over Linguine was tremendous.

Inn by the Lake,5,Lake View,Had a great time

Inn by the Lake,5,Inn by the Lake is great!,We just stayed at the Inn by the Lake for the 4th time and had a great trip. We love the location so we can bike or walk most places. The pool is great and has a two level hot tub! the room is nice and I appreciate having a mini fridge.
Inn by the Lake,4,Okay Hotel Experience,"Nothing spectacular. Good hotel. Kinda in the middle of stateline and actual SLT so walking seems kinda a pain. I thought they had redone the pool building entirely, but it was just a new facade. The rooms look bad, the best was uncomfortable, the wifi was inconvenient, the outlets only half worked."
Inn by the Lake,5,Kocina Family Reunion,"Absolutely the best property and people. We've been coming every Labor Day Weekend for 10 years, plus usually once or twice during the year. For a family reunion there is no better place. The rooms are always pristine, the pool area is a delight, the picnic are and the bowling alley/restaurant on the property makes it ideal. We love it...

Inn by the Lake,2,Old and run down!,Stayed here for 1 night. Friendly check in staff but the hotel needs and overhaul. Hallways are shabby and the room had a damp smell. The photos are misleading.

Inn by the Lake,3,Ok Place for short visit,"The Inn by the Lake is ok by tourist area standards. The hotel room was old and needed updating. Staff was friendly, and recommended good dinner restaurant. Best for families looking to spend a vacation with lots to do nearby.

Inn by the Lake,5,Great place to stay in winter,"So much to like -- beautiful view, close to everything, bowling pizza for kids right there and I especially love that my dog is welcome! It's not much more expensive than the cheap motels around South Lake Tahoe -- shop for the discounts."
Inn by the Lake,2,Dated and tired,"Check in staff were condescending when asking which room we had and made us feel less valued due to booking a budget room. General cleanliness of the room was ok, but a few hairs were found on the towels. The rooms also have very thin walls. The free parking and location to Heavenly was very good along with the proximity... More"

Inn by the Lake,2,VERY DISSAPOINTING,We chose this facility based on location and website and offerings. I was VERY disappointed and would not recommend.

Inn by the Lake,5,Awesome experience!!,"The stay was great. very pleased with the hotel and its accomodations. The pool area and the dual level hot tub...very relaxing. This hotel had everything around it, especially if you have kids to entertain..bowling ally and ice rink in the back, resteraunt next door with very good breakfast and a ice cream shop with a up stairs popular resteraunt within feet from the hotel. Oh, the Lake, just across the street, very, very NICE!!!"
Inn by the Lake,4,Great location,"This was a reasonably priced place in a great location right on the lake. Good restaurants were easily accessible and the hot tub and pool were nice.

Inn by the Lake,5,"Everthing you need, right on-site","Fabulous location. Conference facility, bowling, restaurant, pool, hot tub, and fitness facility all close together AND an incredible view of the Lake. Rooms were easy to get to. My only criticism would be the elevator. It took a long time to move between floors and it abruptly closes the micro second you press the floor button."
Inn by the Lake,4,Roberts Family Vacation,I really enjoyed our stay. We will be booking with this Inn by the lake again. I was nice being across from the lake and not right in the middle of tourist hell. Close enough to everything we'll be b

I am certain to stay again when in town. Even the staff preparing breakfast had a great attitude this morning."
Palmeiras Beach Club at Grove Isle,1,What A Dump!,"I was expecting the type of property from years past, where the quaint experience of Baleens and the exotic decor reigned. Needless to say, it doesn't even resemble what was. The first experience was with a property manager that appeared to come from a different industry, as he was extremely rude and overwhelming. The fancy elegance with the monkey- theme... More"
Courtyard Sunnyvale Mountain View,5,Affordable clean hotel with friendly staff,I stayed here for an evening during a recruiting trip to the area.

Aqua Beach Inn,3,Okay if you don't need fancy.,"Overall, the value was good for our purpose which was just a place to sleep. The front desk staff were top notch, going above and beyond to make sure that our room was satisfactory. The kitchenette was useful. The curious stains on the carpet and duvet would make me think twice about staying here again however."
Aqua Beach Inn,5,Clean and cozy,"One of the reasons we liked the Aqua Beach Inn because it was not one of those humongous hotels, but smaller and homier. It was also very inviting when you first walked in. Easy to unload you suitcases and get to your room which had everything you would need. Gorgeous view of the ocean from your balcony, and close to... More"

The manager worked very hard and was there all the time. I was worried that she never got to see her family since she was ALWAYS there. She really needs more help. The maintenance man and the cleaning... More
Aqua Beach Inn,4,Mostly satisfied....,One elevator for this large 10 story hotel was not good. Also all the hallways and elevator were extremely muggy and hot. When we arrived we had to park in the far extra parking lot and carry all of our luggage I. The pouring rain bc they allowed bikers to park under the entire awning unload rock. Very dissapointed in that lack of customer service. Other than that we had a beautiful room with very comfortable beds and a great view.
Aqua Beach Inn,4,pleasantly surprised,"when i saw the neighborhood i wasn't exactly sure. there are some brand new places/hotels nearby, but there are also some very run down places nearby also. all worked out very well for our stay however and everyone at the hotel was nice, the place was clean, and despite appearances there wasn't any trouble and we felt safe where we were"

Aqua Beach Inn,4,very nice and clean hotel.,"Small hotel which made it nice. Not a lot of people all over the place. Rooms very clean and spacious with balconies in every room. Every room had beach view. Not on the beach, it's separated by the boardwalk. In which you come out of your room and you are right there with all the activities and restaurants. Very nice night life, and the beach is still right there. I do recommend this Hotel"
Aqua Beach Inn,4,"Family stay, 3 kids, overall good stay","Hotel was clean. Very loud at night. Two bars out front and the strip.

Holiday Inn Express & Suites Tacoma Downtown,1,"40,000 Points down the drain",Room is nice but everything else was terrible. First off the hallway smelt like a 1970's hippie convention. Yes I am aware that It's legal in Washington State but I thought no smoking in the hotel would also cover that as well. The worst issue was the free breakfast. The breakfast attendant must have decided to save the hotel... More

Hampton Inn Atlanta-Mall Of Georgia,4,Hotel,The room was ok. It took 10 minutes for me to check in with no wait. The young lady at desk was apparently occupied in back office. Had to call front desk just so she would come up front. Noticed in my room there was a rag hanging on the shower that had been used and the trash can had trash in it. Went to complain and of course no one was at front desk. Didn't stay the night. Lesson learned

We were on the second floor and took the stairs. Stay out of the stairwells. They haven't been swept in months. Unfriendly staff.. Parking is across the street in a sketchy parking lot. Our experience was the worst ever. I suggest... More
"Quality Hotel & Suites ""At The Falls""",3,Try somewhere else...,This hotel is very dated. Rooms were clean enough though. The parking is limited. Wifi was sketchy. Beds and pillows however were wonderful! I would probably not stay again though. Not much around the hotel but we had supper at the Red Coach Inn which was just around the corner. Meal was great.
"Quality Hotel & Suites ""At The Falls""",4,Nicer on the inside!,The hotel is clean and fairly new on the inside. Comfortable rooms. Bathrooms are small but full tub and good shower. Not a luxury place but pleasant. Fabulous location and views of the Falls fireworks from some rooms. Staff was very helpful. Dog friendly!
"Quality Hotel & Suites ""At The Falls""",1,Blood on the carpet,"Walked into this tired hotel and was put off. Once I saw blood on the carpet in my room, room 350, I decided it was time to check out. Disgusting! Fortunately, I had some helpful staff at the front desk that gave me a refund so I could run out of there."
Holiday Inn Express & Suites Portland-Jantzen Beach,5,Convenient & far enough from the freeway for quiet,"The staff were especially helpful and nice. I showed up at one in the morning and still received a courteous reception. Breakfast in the morning was good as far as continental's go, and the bed was quite comfortable with fresh soft sheets."
Holiday Inn Express & Suites Portland-Jantzen Beach,1,"Would not go here again, next time Red Lion","First night was okay, there a band aid was in the pool, my gf pointed it out and we left to our room. Second night a water pipe burst causing water outage for the whole building and damaging their computer area. Our room and our friends adjacent room had ants in it. The phone in our room was not connecting to any inner hotel numbers so we couldn't have notified them of this issue or any medical emergency even if we wanted to using their phone system. When we left Sunday morning I notified the front desk of these issues and they said hotel GM would be calling me to try and rectify the situation. This never happened. After waiting a week I contacted the hotel for a refund for the one night and they informed me since I booked through Expedia I would have to contact them. After getting a hold of Expedia they contacted the hotel and were able to retrieve 1/2 of the cost of the night. I was amazed the hotel would not refund us our entire night considering the conditions of the rooms and lack of basic services. We could not go to the bathroom for the entire night (verified this at 10 PM, and again in the morning at 10 AM, the water in the toilets were backing up after one flush) and had to drive down to Chevron a few miles down the road to use their facilities and purchase drinking water. I can't even begin to comprehend how refunding half the night for these kind of inconveniences is fair to anyone who stayed during this time. I cannot recommend this place."
Holiday Inn Express & Suites Portland-Jantzen Beach,5,Fantastic!,"This is the 4th time we have stayed at this location and it is wonderful. Breakfast, wifi and a pool. Its also near all kinds of stores and food! Just fantastic. The staff are also very sweet and caring. :)"
Hampton Inn & Suites Camarillo,2,Disappointing room and stay,Paying full price while hotel is under construction is not acceptable...newly renovated room was mediocre at best...room only had one chair...no lounge chair ...previously provided when staying there...furniture was cheaply built and made...cleanliness of room was at best just acceptable...found things left behind by former guests...dirty floor...bed was comfortable however...breakfast was just OK...nothing to rave about and certainly not a selling point for me to stay there...staff was very friendly and informative however...would hesitate to stay there again...very disappointing for sure...

Hampton Inn & Suites Camarillo,4,One night stop over,"Just a quick one night stop over for our family. But the beds were very comfortable, and the hotel in general felt recently renovated and nice. The staff was very friendly. There was more noise than I'm used to at hotels from people walking around in the room above us and people slamming the doors in the hallway early in the morning. Some minor things that didn't bother us in this one night stayover, but maybe in a longer stay, we were missing a microwave in our room and either a large picture or mirror on the wall as there were metal picture hanging brackets and nothing on them."

This HI was up to the usual high standard and is a place we feel good to stay. The complimentary breakfast is more than adequate for our needs although a non cheese hot choice would be most welcome. The staff were helpful... More
Hampton Inn & Suites Camarillo,5,The PLACE to stay in Camarillo!,"Great Hotel, wonderful location and good shops and GREAT restaurants (not just fast-food) within walking distance! Easy drive to the beaches and to 'outlet-shops' if you wish. Away from the crowds closer to LA."
Hampton Inn & Suites Camarillo,5,Love this place!!!!!,"We stay here all the time when visiting family in the area. This is my favorite Hampton Inn.

Hampton Inn & Suites Camarillo,5,"Very good hotel, with clever staff!","Very helpful and friendly staff, who upgraded the room, even though they could not see from their notes that it should accomodate 5 persons. They also gave very good advice regarding restaurants and nearby attractions like Six Flags in LA county. The beds were very comfortable and clean. The breakfast room was also very tidy and had plenty of space. There as also a nice pool there (which we did not make use of). Very good value for money. It also had a convenient location for us, close to Camarillo's attractions as well as other places within driving distance, like for example LA, Santa Barbara, Malibu and Solvang. The business room was also very useful, and things were in order."
Hampton Inn & Suites Camarillo,3,Bummed,"It would be really nice if when a hotel is under construction, that is stated before it is booked so we can then make a decision if we want to deal with it or not. It really is not a surprise you want when you get there. When I walked into my room there were caulk guns on the floor and other construction materials laying around. How does that get missed when the room is cleaned"
Hampton Inn & Suites Camarillo,4,Comfortable,"Our room was spacious, comfortable, and clean."
Hampton Inn & Suites Camarillo,2,Has gone downhill,I have stayed at this location several times and this place has gone downhill. They spent a lot to upgrade it-now they need to invest in good staff and bring back the happy hour! I was put in a handicap accessible room-so if you need those types of rooms they are well equipped!
Hampton Inn & Suites Camarillo,5,Hampton is Happening in Camarillo!,"Excellence in customer service, rooms and the breakfast provided! Everything is done with such quality and kindness!

Excellent customer service from her! Always smiled and was so helpful. We loved this hotels location too. We will be back soon ."
Hampton Inn & Suites Camarillo,3,First come first serve/Change the curtain,"First come first serve basis should be put in effect. Rooms were assigned before guests checked in and prevented me from getting a much wanted side of the hotel. Curtain change is very much needed in room 224. It's got a big window with very thin, net looking curtain that will not block the sunlight in the morning."
Hampton Inn & Suites Camarillo,5,Stupendous Stay,The staff was marvelous and extremely helpful. Our stay ws excellent. We stayed here the night before our wedding with our whole wedding party.

Best Western Luxury Inn,3,The pool was much too cold and not as nice as the pictures,"This hotel is in an awful area, and the pictures make it look really nice, in reality the pool is tiny and next to a car park, the water was freezing, and the general customer base at breakfast was a little out of my comfort zone. It was an overnight stop for me and I arrived late and left early,... More"

Best Western Luxury Inn,2,Dirty bathroom and rude staff,"The woman who checked us in upon our arrival was incredibly rude and immediately put a damper on stay. I'm not sure if we were given a handicapped room or if they are all similar, but the bathroom didn't have a tub and was absolutely disgusting. It was one big room with a drain in the floor and did not appear to have been cleaned in some time. One corner appeared to have blood. At 5 a.m. A group of workers with coolers stood at the end of the other hallway from us and we're speaking so loudly for over 10 minutes it woke up my husband, my infant, and I. As my in laws have recently moved to the area I expect we will be visiting Tracy frequently but I will NEVER again stay at this hotel."

River Side Motel Marina,3,"Some great, some bad","My husband and I stayed at this motel for a night away without the kids. We were looking for something relatively cheap near the Little River Casino and only paid 99 for the room. We had a single queen room and it served it's purpose as somewhere to just sleep. The room was very small, but clean and neat with... More"
Brentwood Lodging,4,"Clean, quiet, and friendly","The Brentwood Lodge is conveniently located. Staff was friendly and helpful. Cabins were very clean and comfortable. AC worked great, and great circulation if you would rather have the windows open. Water was a little smelly. They need to install better filtration or something. Units were a little light on storage space. I don't mind living out of a suitcase... More"
Americas Best Value Inn - Charlotte,4,this is a no frills efficient motel,"If you're looking for a motel to spend a night at cheap it is a fairly good deal. The room was clean, but it had a slight order. Tthe bed covering had some burn holes and tears. The eating area is somewhat small and breakfast selection was very basic. The bottom line: If this is a stop off on the way from point A to point B and you want to save some money for your vacation you might give it a try. If you are real particular about where you stay, then you might want to try another motel. considering the money I saved and service I received, I would stay there again"
Americas Best Value Inn - Charlotte,4,Good for Price.,"All I needed was a clean bed and a shower, it suited me fine."
Americas Best Value Inn - Charlotte,3,Would stay again,"Nice people,"
North Port Motel,4,"Clean comfortable room, but not at all fancy","I agree with most of the comments from the other reviewer (MKEcritic). I gave it 4 stars because our room was clean and comfortable and the motel well met our limited needs. Other travelers would see it differently. It all depends on what you are looking for. If all you are looking for is a clean room to stay, then... More"

Value Host Motor Inn,4,Very nice rooms,"For the price, you can't beat it (63). The only complaint I have is the Continental breakfast. Only choices were a donut or toast and coffee or juice. Wish there were more choices, so I went to other places for breakfast. The rooms are super clean, the staff very friendly. It's why I love the UP so much. Will definitely... More"

Acadia Suites,5,A Place to Go Back To,"It had been a number of years since my husband and I visited Bar Harbor when we decided to return.

Location - great, a short walk to the Bar Harbor shops, restaurants and village green bus stops (The Island... More"
Robbins Motel,2,Should Have Spent 30 More,"I should have reviewed the Robbins more carefully before making my reservation. I would have been far happier spending 30-40 more a night (and I am a THRIFTY traveler!). First of all, the room is not up to code: there was no smoke alarm. The A/C unit barely worked (probably because the filter needs a cleaning BADLY) and there isn't... More"

Quality Inn,3,Labor Day vacation on Mount Desert Island,Location of the Quality Inn facilitates easy access to other parts of the island while still within easy walking distance of downtown Bar Harbor.

Ocean House Hotel,3,Quaint and creaky old hotel,"The host and hostess are real nice. The hotel is very old, with steep stairs. Noise travels in the building, but luckily the median age of the guests is somewhere north of 60, so the place settles down at a reasonable hour. The breakfast was real good, and the coffee was very tasty. The many outdoor locations to sit adds... More"
Ocean House Hotel,4,Nice for a couple of days,"My wife got a message while we were there and loved it. Parking is a bit cluttered as they must park cars for people on Monhegan Island. Joe is a bit anal about the parking situation but is a real nice guy. Pat was great. We only stayed 2 days and could have stayed longer,"
Rodeway Inn,4,Nice place,"Room was clean, bed was comfy, staff was friendly. Breakfast was pretty bare bones, but standard for most hotels in this price range. If we find ourselves in this town again, we will stay here. Very nice motel."

Days Inn Mattoon,4,good room and sevice at fair price,the pool was clean the was just what i wanted
Days Inn Mattoon,2,Fine as a last resort...,"Imagine our disgust when we woke the following morning and found that the bed sheets had stains all over them.  If the hotels do nothing else, they should make absolutely certain their housekeeping staff is top notch and that they actually clean a room and change the bedding.  There were also dead insects on the floor of the bathroom.  I now know why this hotel had rooms available while everyone else was sold out."
Days Inn Mattoon,5,Illinios Trip,It was very quiet. Breakfast was the same thing everyday.
Days Inn Mattoon,4,convenient overnight stop,"Worked OK for an overnight stop along I-57. Convenient to I-57, although internet-generated directions can be a little confusing, but local resident had no problem finding. Nothing fancy or too modern, but clean. Didn't have time to check the pool or other amenities."
Days Inn Mattoon,5,Heading to Texas,"The woman at check-in was teriffic, she went out of her way to be acomodating, even to take microwave popcorn from her own stash and make it for my wife and I. If you have a family outing there is a great pool area and attached resturant. We will stay again if we are through the area.Thank you"
Days Inn Mattoon,3,It was ok,"Ok for the price.. the bed was hard.. woke every morning. With a backache. The ""hot breakfast"" was a tub of bland mushing oatmeal."
Days Inn Mattoon,4,Needs updated but very pleasant,The rooms were outdated. But they were clean and very comfortable. The hotel has so much potential but it's not being used as it should. I would def stay here again. Price was good. Breakfast was a little disappointing but it worked for what we needed.  The shower was really nice. Endless hot water.  Tv channels we a let down. But we were so sleepy we didn't care.   Will stay here again.
Days Inn Mattoon,3,Relaxing,Very safe area. Shopping area and restaurants nearby
Americas Best Value Inn Suites,3,Average place to stay,"Our softball team stayed here for a tournament in Duquoin. This is just an average hotel. The bedding is badly in need of updating.

Wonderful stay!"
Americas Best Value Inn,1,Worst customer service from front desk,"I called the Best Value Inn in Auburn, ME to inquire about an event taking place there tomorrow and the front desk person who picked up the phone said to call back after 9am tomorrow, yet the event starts at 8am. When I told him this he was extremely rude and told me that this wasn't his problem. I asked... More"
Americas Best Value Inn,1,disgusting,"we didn't even stay there , we had friends drive by 3 days prior to our stay and they told us the place was in disrepair , screens out and filthy. we tried to call them for 3 days to cancel our reservations and they did not answer the phone. On the day we arrived we tried to call again and they finally answered the phone we told them our problems with the hotel and they yelled to late to cancel and hung up on us . They are now charging our credit card UGH you should take them off your site deplorable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Americas Best Value Inn,4,Don't judge a book......,"Stayed two nights over parents weekend in October. The bleak exterior and entrance was a little off-putting, so we were pleasantly surprised by the size and condition of the room. The heat wasn't working, so it was pretty cold, but it was obvious they were doing their best to fix it so we toughed it out the first night. They supplied a space heater the next morning, but then moved us to another room (just as clean and comfortable) the second night. The hotel was full but we never heard our neighbors. Bathroom and breakfast were basic. Staff was friendly. Odd-numbered rooms face rear/away from street and parking lot. Recommended for quick stay."
Hampton Inn Macomb,5,great stay,"Clean rooms, wonderfully comfortable bed. It is nice to have a microwave and a frig in the room. Nice pool.

Have stayed here many times as our daughter is at the... More"
Hampton Inn Macomb,2,Poor reservation help!,"Rooms were fine, breakfast was fair and reservation were a disaster. Poorly trained reservationist, said room would cost one thing and said he'd call me back after specking with management for rate. He didn't. I called back the next day he quoted me higher rate...said rate had been approved. After fighting for it, an adjustment was made."
Magnuson Hotel Heritage Inn,3,Solid,"Check in is easy. Close to gas stations and food. Room for truck and RV parking. Rooms are basic and hotel clean. Wifi is good and continental breakfast is good. Pet friendly. I stay here 2-3 times per year and it's a solid hotel, I feel safe and the accommodations are what I would expect for the price."
Best Western Riverside Inn,4,Nice hotel,Desk clerk was very helpful when I called at the last minute to get room. She was very helpful at check in. A storm was coming and she even printed out a radar map to show us when the storm would hit.
Best Western Regency Inn,3,Bad first impression,"The rooms at this motel are fine and the breakfast was sufficient but the wifi availability is terrible. In addition, I had to stand by the lobby front door or go outside to keep my cell phone calls from breaking up or dropping as did others in our party. Also, the bathroom door automatically closes unless you prop it open... More"

Hampton Inn Champaign Urbana,5,Return customer,"I have stayed here several times before. Breakfast is above average with a large area. Employees were very nice. The only complaint I had this time around was the extra soft bed. I felt like I couldn't even sit or lay on the end or sides of the bed without feeling like I was falling off, but that's just my opinion. Still a great place to stay."
Motel 6 Lafayette - University Ave,1,Soooo Disappointing,We were traveling and we were looking for pet friendly hotels.

Best Western Post Oak Inn,3,Motel not Hotel,The price was that of a hotel but it was really more like a motel. The hotel was clean and quite. But the cost was the highest I've ever paid at a BW.

Ambassador Hotel,5,Don't let the outward appearance fool you!,"I was a little worried upon driving up to the hotel, as the outside looked a bit rundown. Upon entering however, it was like stepping back in time. Absolutely beautiful lobby area! Staff were very attentive and helpful. Room was very nice as well. Restaurant (Envoy) had the best brunch I've ever had -- they do small plates instead of... More"
Ambassador Hotel,2,Disorganized and NOT a 4 star property,"The hotel was old but fairly well maintained. I would not call it a 4 star hotel.

We were told that the shuttle would be at the designated pickup area every half hour, so we were there a little before midnight. I decided... More"
Ambassador Hotel,5,Lovley Place to Stay,"We enjoyed our stay, the staff was friendly and helpful with info about where we were visiting. We had dinner at the Envoy which was delish and then drinks in the lounge. We will be sure to return on our next visit to the city!"
Ambassador Hotel,1,Dried vomit on bed skirt,"When I brought photos of dried vomit to the front desk they were dismissive. They asked if the sheets were dirty or stained. Need I say more. Sticky stuff on nightstand. Security guards on the floors and security cameras everywhere. Especially as young women, be safe and stay somewhere else."
Magnuson Grand Hotel,1,Pick another place,"Unfortunately the furnature and decor is from the late 1960s or early 1970s and it also appears it hasn't been kept up since then. They allow pets but unless everything else is booked, as it was for me, I will not return to this place."
Magnuson Grand Hotel,3,"Older Place , But Cleanish","We stayed one night. I peaked into the pool area and it was showing its age, but looked like it would do if you had kids.

Magnuson Grand Hotel,3,Average Hotel,"This hotel is a fine place to stay. I can't really say anything particularly bad about it, but there also wasn't anything great about it.

Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,4,"Great location, good value","The hotel is a bit dated and worn, but not terribly so. It is, however, located on the beach with Miami Beach's boardwalk directly behind the hotel. In the center of Miami Beach. Bed was comfortable and room nicely appointed, just needs a little updating. Good value. Some rooms have terraces and ocean views - again, at a good value.... More"
Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,3,An ok hotel,"This is a solid 3 star hotel, the rooms are old and smell like mildew. The air conditioning is loud and drips. If you get a room on the ocean they have good views and a good balcony. The staff was nice at check in. It's not great but not terrible. It's a typical Miami 3 star hotel."
Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,4,Definite 3 star property but it's on the beach,You can't beat this hotel because it is right on the beach. It is mid beach so away from the hectic and trashy south beach vibe. If you want to escape the incessant pounding music and Kardashian wannabes of the SOuth Beach hotels and neighboring Eden Roc of Fountainbleau then this is a great option. But also don't expect the service of any of these adjacent properties. THe service here is minimal at best. You wait forever at breakfast if you order off the menu. The doormen are non existent as is a concierge. THere is no room service and the food is mediocre. Terrible service out by the pool with a limited menu. No beach chairs - you have to pay an outside vendor. The bathroom was so tiny we could open the door less than halfway because it hit the toilet. Two people trying to use it was like a circus maneuver. It can't possibly be code. There are plastic cups for drinking - no glass but the bed was comfy and the flat screen TV was great. THe staff is not that helpful and the balcony's seem old and in need of paint. We had a gorgeous view but the balconies are interconnected with a rail between them. Our neighbor chain smoked on his balcony which made sitting out extremely unpleasant. That said if you get a good price is really worth it because it is on the beach and that is why I went to Miami Beach in the first place.
Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,3,Beachside resort,"great location this hotel was great resort wise, right on beautiful beach and grounds of hotel beautifully kept but rooms were very tired looking, clean but outdated. Could do with a make over. About a 15 taxi ride from middle of ocean drive, South beach."

Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,5,Great stay,We had a great stay at this hotel. Super nice and helpfull staff that made this stay special. Enjoyed free wine tasting with a nice girls in the lobby and live music. Worth it price and location for the hotel! Will definitelly come back to stay :)
Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,3,Room not ready and sinks at the ladies room by the pool didn't work and we're not fixed.,Basically a nice hotel but service leaves a lot to be desired . For the money you pay these things should not be a problem. We were given coupons for a free breakfast and free drink but as compensation I'd rather have things go the way they are supposed to.
Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,4,Good location for the northern part of Collins Ave,Solid Spot. The only thing that needs work is the food in the hotel. Had 2 meals (1 at the restaurant) and 1 late night room service. Neither was good at all.
Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,1,Sheraton is awful!,"My girlfriends and I booked the sheraton for our weekend trip to Miami.. The hotel did not get our booking correct, we were not give a balcony room although we had booked one. They would not accommodate our requests to move to a balcony room and stated the entire hotel was sold out, so we sucked it up and went to the standard double room. Upon our arrival we were hit in the face with a SWELTERING, tiny room. The room temperature was above 90. We called the front desk and explained the problem only to be dismissed very quickly by rude staff again stating the hotel was sold out. They sent up the maintenance man who said he fixed it after trying for less than 10 mins. Three hours later room was still insanely hot, so we demanded a manager come up to check it out. Finally, two managers came and confirmed that the room was indeed unbearable and we weren't just complaining for no reason. Another 6 hours later, at around midnight, we were given a new room an upgrade to a suite - which was honestly a standard size room (whereas the first room which was supposed to be standard) was a sardine can size. The staff left our luggage in the lobby for hours before bringing it to our room at midnight and said they didn't know who it belonged to so they couldn't move it to a safe place. The staff was rude, the hotel is rundown, the rooms are tiny, the bars are gross, the pool water was disgusting. This hotel was just not good. I'd spend a little bit more of the money and stay elsewhere."
Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,4,Older place but overall pretty good,We spent 4 nights here and It was pretty good overall. The place is older but you know that going in and it certainly is not priced at the W so what can you expect. The staff were pretty good and as a Platinum Member they give you a great breakfast. The bottle of Champagne on Ice and a great... More
Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,2,The hotel is tired!,"All the staff all looked unhappy, and miserable, I think the hotel is in dyer need of some TLC. Or serious attention. Quite lacking for its position and pricing. Waiting staff in the breakfast area were very helpful and attentive. Thank god the friendly staff next door at the Fontaineblur were there to save the days n nights!"
Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,3,parking fee too expensive,Parking fee is too expensive. 29 dollars per night is a lot. Hotel should review and consider to low that price for customers. Personnel that is taking care of the cars (valet pkng) think that are in the racing driving the cars too fast.

Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,1,Bug found in my room!! YIKES!,"There was a small black bug in my room by the bed. Manager-I don't know what kind of bug it is threw it in the trash. He shrugged his shoulders and said, there really isn't anything I can do for you."

However, I did have an issue with closing charges that were applied to the card I used as a GTD only, resulting in a credit that seems to be taking forever. The hotel overall was always clean and well maintained. Elevators could have been built a little bigger!"
Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,4,Everything was great!! ..but the room needs a fridge,"The location is just amazing. I was in Miami for a business conference, however I wanted to actually enjoy my stay so I booked this hotel. It is right on the beach and has amazing views.

Four Points by Sheraton Miami Beach,3,A Reasonable Take on Miami Beach,"Perfect place if you are looking for a more reasonable (quieter and not so expensive) place to stay. The best part of the hotel is that it is on the beach and boardwalk. Some of the rooms have an ocean view, which is worth it if you plan to spend any time in the room. However, the tricky part is...

Hyatt Place Dallas/Las Colinas,5,Righteously good.,"Hotel provides a list of restaurants nearby. this has nothing to do with the hotel, but be wary of delivery in this area, the food pretty much sucks - at least the chinese and pizza.

Highest recommendation."
Hyatt Place Dallas/Las Colinas,5,No shuttle to love field. Great hotel otherwise,"Great hotel, very friendly desk personnel. You should note online and on phone that your free hotel shuttle is for dfw only. I called and confirmed that I was flying in but no one asked me which airport, I had to take a 30 cab each way. That would have made a difference in my choice of hotels or flights."

Everything near the airport was booked, so I booked the Hyatt Place. Staff was amazing, friendly and professional. The rooms, although comfortable, looked a little low-end, but I was there only to sleep a few hours. Really can't complain. And it was quiet, and the water... More"
Hyatt Place Dallas/Las Colinas,5,Excellent Group Experience,"Such a great experience! We traveled as a hockey team, and the team at Hyatt Place was so accommodating!

Renaissance Tulsa Hotel & Convention Center,5,Great for special occasion or passing through Tulsa,"We stayed here after our wedding and was not disappointed. This is definitely the nicest option in town, so it was great for our occasion, but it's also affordable when looking for a staycation or just passing through Tulsa."
Comfort Inn & Suites,4,GOOD TIMES,"Very nice hotel. Wish it was closer to the beach...nice area with good restraints near the hotel. It was quiet, clean, and reasonably priced. Breakfast was ok but not much for Diabetics. We would stay there again."
Comfort Inn & Suites,3,Good for 1-2 nights,I stayed for one night for business. The front desk staff was friendly. Room was clean. Tv worked. Free wifi. Clean shower. Not much more I needed since I was only there to sleep for 6 hours.
Comfort Inn & Suites,4,Great value!! Better than expected.,This is by far the best Choice affiliated hotel in which we have stayed. Everything is clean and orderly and the staff was just great. The breakfast menu is better than most. I would recommend this location to anyone. Ulmerton Rd. is a high traffic volume major artery so a little map study preparation will help at arrival.

Comfort Inn & Suites,5,Frankly speaking,Worth staying here - great breakfast.
Comfort Inn & Suites,5,Just great!,"Last-minute online reservation and it was perfect. Front desk staff gave us a discount after finding out we were military. We asked about breakfast time since our flight was early (7am) and we were informed it started at 6am, but we could just ask morning staff and they could get us something to eat (more later). Also, less than 5... More"
Baymont Inn & Suites Tampa near Busch Gardens / USF,4,Lots of improvements since last visit,"Since my teenage kids all live in Tampa, I usually travel there several times a year to visit, which can get a little costly at times.

Baymont Inn & Suites Tampa near Busch Gardens / USF,3,Probably as we expected.,"Check in - very helpful. Room - probably as we thought from the reviews (we took a chance seeing the comments about refurbishment). Beds - comfortable in main room, pretty shocking bed settee for the kids to sleep on in the sitting area. Pool - looked dirty although we did not use, plenty of others did. Gym - very poor and should be removed as a feature (planet fitness ideal if you do need a day pass for a workout!) Location - absolutely fine for Busch Gardens. Noise - no real problems at all. Price - absolutely fine. Wifi - just about OK. Breakfast - OK. We were not disappointed as such, the hotel was OK, they know they need to refurbish, but probably need to do this sooner rather than later to avoid too many negative reviews. Our main reason for choosing the hotel was because it had separate rooms for us and the kids and it fitted the bill for this reason."
Baymont Inn & Suites Tampa near Busch Gardens / USF,4,A Nice Find,The suite was nice and you could see Busch Gardens from the room. The only downer was the pull out bed needed replaced badly.

Baymont Inn & Suites Tampa near Busch Gardens / USF,3,Tampa visit,The hotel suited my purposes. Staff were helpful. Last 2 nights had no hot water. Sink light stopped working 5 days into trip. The price was good. Room was as clean as it could be. Had microscopic critturs coming from the sink electrical outlet. Overall liked the place. If you are looking for basic this this the place to stay.
Baymont Inn & Suites Tampa near Busch Gardens / USF,2,Memorial Day Getaway,Very dissatisfied with the staff and the lack of caring about at least 5 different guest (that we know of) not being able to check in until after 5:00 pm because rooms weren't ready. It's a Holiday weekend you would think they would be staffed a little better. They are less than a mile away from a theme park and should no how busy they would be especially on a holiday.
Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Airport,5,Perfect stop as I trekked across country,"Great staff and location was perfect to hop on a van pool for downtown. Staff was helpful and great parking lot.

Hampton Inn & Suites Denver Tech Center,3,Not bad,"The room was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our only complaints were that the tv had terrible reception and had lines through the screen. Also there was definitely people smoking pot on our floor as we could smell it everyday. The only other things were obviously unavoidable, like the construction right next door that was very loud, and the power going out one morning."

Quality Inn & Suites Airport/Cruise Port South,4,Good Pre-Cruise Hotel,Everything was fine for a per-cruise hotel. There were a couple of places nearby to eat (Miller's Ale house I believe) and the hotel I think arranges for transport to the cruise ships.

DoubleTree by Hilton Golf Resort San Diego,3,"No golf, despite the name.","Advertised as a golf resort, but the golf course has been closed for well over a year. One small swimming pool was open, the large lap pool and fitness center are closed :( Not updated in a long time, it's 4 unit 2 story bungalows for much of the property. Quiet, easy access to San Diego which is a 20+ minute drive."
DoubleTree by Hilton Golf Resort San Diego,3,"Wouldn't stay again.  Rooms are nice, that's it.","The rooms are hard to get to, only One elevator and a lot of Stairs. We had a lot of stuff and it was challenging. Also to pay for parking was ridiculous!"
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,2,Two Star Hotel,"The walls between rooms are paper thin. Lots of noise if the room next door is occupied. Not too much light in the bathroom. A $10.00 cab ride away from the historic district downtown. The maids did not clean the room very well. Trash cans were not emptied. Heard they discharged part of the hotel staff. The lobby and breakfast were good.  An older hotel. I think, after this, I will bypass Holiday Inn Express hotels for a while."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,5,Newly renovated & great ammenities!,"My Husband and I stayed here last week after returning from a week long cruise out of Charleston. I usually stay at Marriott's or Hilton properties but thought we would try Holiday Inn Express. We were pleasantly surprised! This is a very nice property that has obviously just been renovated. The lobby was beautifully done, as were the rooms and breakfast areas. The staff all seemed eager to help and please. The General Manager seems like she is doing a great job and is hands on as I saw her at the Front Desk on a few occasions talking to staff and interacting with guests. I really appreciated the fact that they had laundry facilitites there to use also, considering we had a lot of dirty laundry from the cruise.The free breakfast was also a bonus as it wasn't your usual boring continental breakfast offerings. They had different items on each of the mornings we were there. Some were: Omelettes, sausage, biscuits, bacon and warm cinnamon buns! The coffee was great (and I am fussy with my coffee!) and they even had a pancake machine.While the location wasn't right downtown we did get a reasonable rate and there was a FREE trolley service right at the side of the hotel. We didn't use the car, instead just jumped on the trolley and were in downtown Charleston in no time!"
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,"Great, clean, pet friendly","Staff is outstanding! Food at breakfast was always fresh and hot. Staff very helpful for info on local delivery takeout. Only complaint is room lighting. Bathroom especially, trouble applying makeup and shaving."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,5,Vacation Time,"I really like the hotel, the location was nice. Definitely the best choice, last year I went to Colorado and we stayed in Denver at Hyatt hotel, the hotel was good but at Hyatt they charge for parking, breakfast and wifi, and at the Holiday Inn Express this all free. I will pickup the Holiday Inn Express again for future vacations."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,2,Not the greatest,"I checked in to the hotel greeted with a smile, which was good. Mind you the concierge was a little chatty. But that may just be me since I was exhausted coming in. When I went in to the room, it was stuffy even with the AC on. Which was really, really loud. I could not sleep. And if I turn down the AC, it was too hot. Opening the window, there was too much noise from the traffic outside. It was close to the highway and it was impossible to drive out of the lot without having to make a U-turn somewhere first. The bathroom was moldy. The breakfast was bad. The coffee was horrible. All in all, I had to check out after 1 night of my 5 night stay and checked in at a different hotel altogether. I was not happy."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,5,We left with smiles on our faces,"We were thoroughly satisfied with our stay at Holiday Inn Express.  For a budget hotel, the surroundings were clean, freshly painted, and we commented that the bedding was the most comfortable of any we'd slept in.  We would definitely recommend this hotel."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,5,Good location,Weather was cold but we enjoyed the visit. I resent being forced to do this to enable your marketing. 50 words Minimum indeed!
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,Good price and quality,"Overall, I enjoy this hotel. I have stayed there a total of 5 times for business purposes. Each stay was for nearly a week. The staff are always warm and welcoming. A decent free breakfast and decent free wifi. My bathroom has been ""dirty"" a few times, such as hair in the sink or toilet. But nothing horrible enough to request another room. Overall, great stay."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,Clean and current hotel,"Our stay at the Holiday Inn Express was fine. The room was clean and neat, the staff friendly and helpful. I did find the hotel a bit too far from the downtown, although it is on the free shuttle line. When we rented a car we could park it for free at the hotel, which I am told is not always so. There is nothing happening right around the hotel, but it is near a marina."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,5,Great Hotel,"Very comfortable, but location was not the best. Hotel in general was nice and clean."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,5,Great place to stay!!!!,Great staff and well taken care of facility!
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,close to downtown,staff very nice This hotel allows pets keep that in mind if you are not an animal person. I think the first floor is reserve for pet owners so if you don't love pets ask for an upper floor.
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,MUSC Interview,"Hotel and room were very clean. I didn't need any extraordinary service but the staff was friendly and helpful during check-in and check out although they were a little slow and there was a ~5 min line for both. Free breakfast was the usual for a holiday inn express, which is pretty good as far as free breakfasts go. I walked from the hotel to Hominy Grill for dinner (.6 miles) and to MUSC for an interview. You are pretty close by but you have to cross multiple busy streets without a crosswalk or traffic light so it would not be walkable for everyone. Parking is free and the lot seems adequately big."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,Chose rate over location,"We chose Holiday Inn Express- Ashley River, because the rate was considerably lower than the hotels in the center of the historic district. While our choice meant we could not walk to the historic area, the free shuttle worked out well for us. The location was convenient for our visit (driving our own car) to the Magnolia Plantation and a dinner in Mount Pleasant. The hotel was was clean and our breakfast was great. Parking is free ... A bonus. Staff was friendly."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,5,Great breakfast,"Free parking, included wifi, and one of the best breakfasts I have seen at this type of hotel. What's not to like? The location is pretty convenient, and the pool (while small) is a nice addition. It's not a place to hang around all day, but works great. The rooms also have microwaves and refrigerators."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,Hotel per chi ha la macchina,"Hotel pulito e comodo, secondo gli standard della catena di cui fa parte, camere ampie e con tutti i servizi. Colazione inclusa, non di eccelsa qualit, ma comunque comoda poich non ci sono bar o locali nelle vicinanze tranne qualche fast food. Puttosto fuori dal centro storico pertanto consigliabile solo a chi dispone di un'auto propria o a noleggio."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,2,Room with an odor,"We checked in and noticed an odor similar to cat urine in first floor room. I called front desk, they contacted housekeeping and she came immediately to spray and request an ozone something. I called front desk back and asked for another room. They did not have one with two queens so we took a king. The front desk asked if we wanted a roll away and I said yes. We left for dinner and when we returned, no rollaway. I did not call desk back. All of us crammed on the king bed."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,5,Nice and simple.,"I enjoyed my experience. Easy to get to (off US 17, a.k.a. the Crosstown)."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,2,Hotel Parking,Hotel Parking Garage poorly lit and in need of upgrading allowing access directly to hotel without going down stairs.
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,Recently remodeled. Downtown near the marinas.,"This is a good clean hotel with plenty of parking (many downtown Charleston hotels have parking issues). The rooms were fine, and each had a balcony (although, not much of a balcony). Full breakfast included."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,3,"Big service, Small Room",The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful! They were so eager to make our stay pleasant. They really went the extra mile to be friendly. The problem for us was the size of the room and bathroom. The doorway was VERY small and my husband had difficulty getting through with our bag - he had to push bag in and then step in. The ceiling was very low in the hallway and the bathroom. I am 5'6 and I could easily reach up and touch the ceiling in the hallway and bathroom. We even made the comment that no basketball stars would be able to stay here. My husband is 6'1 and had to duck to get into the shower. The outside noise was also very loud and woke us up both mornings. The room we had was nice and clean though.
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,Good base for touring the Low country,"Great place to stay while doing the Charleston tourist attractions. Much cheaper than staying downtown, and the shuttle bus takes you into the city from a stop just outside the hotel, so no parking charges.Some maintenance issues with the room which were not all fixed during our stay. Internet was slow but free. Breakfast was the usual HIE fare.Staff were all keen to help, but the hotel is probably feeling its age."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,5,Wonderful hotel close to downtown,"My husband and I stayed here over the weekend to celebrate my birthday. The hotel was packed but that didn't seem to affect the staff. They were very friendly, attentive and accommodating. The breakfast in the morning was wonderful-full of choices and whenever they got low on something a staff member came and changed it out. I will be staying there again next time I vacation to Charleston!"
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,Good hotel.,"Part of a roadtrip through USA. Staff here are very helpful and the hotel is modern and well kept. The location is a little a way out of town, but this is reflected in the price."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,Convenient to sites,Close to historic district and to Folly Beach. It was easy to plan the day after breakfast and return in the evening. Hotel was quiet and the staff was very accommodating.
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,Nice and affordable.,Everything was very nice for the price. Convenient to the city and comfortable.
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,nice getaway,"The hotel was very clean, and the staff was friendly and helpful in planning downtown activities. The location is not great, we didn't have a pretty view of anything from our room, but it was still only a quick $10 cab ride to downtown."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,5,Our Charleston stopover.,We stopped over here on our way to Florida. Very pleasant experience and close to downtown historic district. We enjoyed our 1 night stay.
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,3,Review,N/A
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,5,Short Stay,"There was nothing real close to walk to, but a short cab ride to a lot of places."
Holiday Inn Express Charleston Dwtn - Ashley River,4,Not enough restaurants around,Was disappointed there was not alot of eating places around.

Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa,4,Spectacular room with one drawback,The Grand Hyatt's grounds are beautiful. We were assigned to a dazzling and spacious suite. The reason I didn't assign 5 stars is the shower was absolutely horrid. It had very peculiar settings which neither my wife and I ever figured out.

Grand Hyatt Kauai Resort & Spa,3,Kauai (Poipu) Hawaii,"Not the quality expected for a Grand Hyatt. Great location to shops, restaurants, beach. Many more children of all ages than expected for this time of year therefore the pool area became less desirable.

Hampton Inn-fairfax City,3,Convenient hotel to Fairfax City,"The room was fine, with two exceptions: I was placed in a room adjacent to the elevator shafts, and the wall air conditioning unit was excessively noisy.

Comfort Inn Suites,3,Fair price for what you get,Stayed two nights in late April. The parking is a little confusing as it is shared with the hotel next door and could use more lighting.

Hampton Inn Suites Camp Springs/Andrews AFB,4,"Nice hotel, not the best location","I was not familiar with DC.

Kalispell Grand Hotel,4,"Comfy, cozy but oh, so grand!","A friend of mine always books the cheapest, bare bones hotels when he travels. He says he'd rather spend money on doing things than on where he stays. I wholeheartedly disagree!! To me, where I stay IS part of my overall traveling experience. So, when we happened upon the Kalispell Grand Hotel, an historic gem in downtown Kalispell, Montana, I... More"

Extended Stay America Atlanta - Duluth,1,Unsafe stay,"Not happy because when I got there this was like the umpteenth time that I made a reservation through Hotels.com and not get what I reserved!!!. Makes me want to never use Hotels.com again. The room was run down, snags in the carpet, snags in the towels and sheets. And what made it worse was the side door stayed unlocked all night, drug activity in the parking lot, and there were no cameras in the stairwell from the side door....anybody could have come into the hotel and no one would see it. Very unpleasant stay and unsafe. Will not stay there ever again."
Extended Stay America Atlanta - Duluth,4,Great home away from home,"The hotel was located close to Gwinnett Center and restaurants. The price was very reasonable considering it had: large refrigerator, flat screen TV, internet and microwave. I have stayed at other hotels that cost more but did not have these features."
Extended Stay America Atlanta - Duluth,1,pay more and stay some place nicer,"Had a terrible stay. I've stayed in many extended stays across the country and this one has shamed the brand. This hotel smelled, it was unclean, dark and cramped. The rooms were dated,my mattress didn't even have a fitted sheet I saw how nasty and disgusting the conditions of the mattresses. We didn't have any toilet paper in our room upon arrival.the room was less than mediocre. Towels were dingy and worn out. Fire detector was hanging on by a wire literally about to fall off the ceiling. hotel was in bad condition, was more like a motel. Will never stay here again. next time I'll pay more money to stay in a better hotel."
Extended Stay America Atlanta - Duluth,5,Great Customer Service,"I had a pleasant stay here while I was visiting family for Thanksgiving.

Galt House Hotel,4,Either You Like it or You Don't,"The Galt House is not your typical modern day hotel - you will either love it or hate it. I'll start with the cons: large hotel, walls are thin and the decor may be perceived as outdated. Based on the location of your room you may run into some noise issues. I was on the 22nd floor tucked in a... More"
Galt House Hotel,5,Galt House delivers again!,"No need to look anywhere else when staying in Louisville! For the price, proximity to YUM Center and the beautiful views of the river, it's the best deal going! Cafe Magnolia (2nd floor) is a great casual restaurant. Thelma's Deli is perfect for fruit, sandwiches, pizza, breakfast biscuits, etc."
Galt House Hotel,5,Great place to stay,"2nd time to stay at the Galt House. My son's archery team stayed there during the NASP tournament. Great facility and staff was wonderful. Rooms were great, and group price made it affordable. Food at Cafe Magnolia was excellent."
Galt House Hotel,4,Overpriced but convenient for concert,I booked this hotel for a concert I was taking my teenager to. The room had cracked and nailed badly crown molding. the area close around the bed had not been vacuumed in quite some time. The shower had NO water pressure. On the positive side the beds were comfortable and the pillows were great!
Galt House Hotel,3,"GREAT place to stay, but lacking that personal touch","I was at Galt house for a convention for 3 days. The hotel rooms are nice and the hotel is a great, relaxing location.

Galt House Hotel,4,School trip at the Galt House,I was here for a school trip to Louisville with a group of students.

Galt House Hotel,3,"Exceptional service, not so much detail to bathroom cleanliness","We chose this hotel because it is attached to the KFC Yum center and was told we could use the skywalk to and from the center (without, essentially, leaving the hotel). Unfortunately the skywalk was closed going IN to the venue, but we were able to use it after the event. We still think this is a grand idea, however,... More"
Galt House Hotel,5,Superb!,I love visiting the Galt House because the customer service is fantastic rooms are always super clean. The suites tower is my favorite part of the hotel. The breakfast is phenomenal (especially the pancakes ordered from room service). Definitely plan on a relaxing stay at the Galt House.
Galt House Hotel,2,"Great location, but worn and old","Room was dark, and smelled musty. Everything was well worn and in dire need up updating. Very mundane bathroom. Front desk staff was indifferent at best. I was so bad, we changed our stay from two nights to one and moved to a Hilton Garden Inn that was far better."
Galt House Hotel,3,Great Location,"The Galt House is in a perfect location. It's within walking distance of restaurants, pubs, museums, and shopping. It also has great views of the Ohio River and 4th Street. However, the rooms are in need of updating. The airconditioner and plumbing made noises all night. I stay here frequently and some changes have been made but much more needs... More"

Galt House Hotel,4,Garth Brooks Concert,"The room was amazing! It was large , very clean and the shower was excellent!

I still give it 4... More"
Galt House Hotel,5,Great Choice for Meetings or Dinners,Valet is best parking choice. 3rd floor bridge has indoor bridge between 2 towers Retail Row has regional inventory. Great place to stay for large event hosted here. Plus it's within walking distance of many local attractions on Museum Row trendy restaurants.
Galt House Hotel,3,Elevators stink!,Would be a 4 but the elevators are terrible. You have to wait forever. You even take escalators down to lower levels to get enough space to ride the elevators up. Other than that a nice hotel. Pretty river view from some rooms kind of makes up for it.
Galt House Hotel,4,Classic Kentucky,"This is a mainstay within the Louisville, KY landscape. You can tell just by walking in that this hotel has been in existence for some time and is a landmark to the Ohio River backdrop. Beautiful scenery abounds in this stately location."
Galt House Hotel,5,The best sleep ever!,The stay at this hotel was amazing. The suites were a great value and the beds were like sleeping on clouds and floating. I loved the pillows and they have Bath and Body work soap and lotion. It was a very nice hotel for a very good price!

Millennium Hotel Durham,3,Actually less than average,"I'm just being honest here. We booked this hotel because we were traveling with our two dogs on our way to FL.

Millennium Hotel Durham,1,Mold in rooms,"Mold in the first three rooms they showed me. Not until they sent me to the top floor in the fourth room did I find a room that didn't smell of mold. Good service willing to help, and very attentive, but they need to fix the mold in their rooms."
Millennium Hotel Durham,3,Needs serious renovation... but ok.,"The location of this hotel is great for visiting Duke or getting around the area.

Days Inn Elk Grove Village/chicago/ohare Airport West,1,A poor showing for a night at Days inn,The carpet was so dirty that we had to where socks and still clean our feet. The Sheets for the bed felt like sandpaper and the shower never gave hot water. Cannot recommend staying here to anyone.
Days Inn Elk Grove Village/chicago/ohare Airport West,1,RATS! There were rats running around the outside.,Rats running around the parking lot. My husband and I saw FIVE rats running around the parking lot and one jumped out a trash can. I don't do rats I am always been afriad of rats and I wasnt expacting that.

We had to find another hotel at night and I had to pay more money.No one was helpful to us at all.
Days Inn Elk Grove Village/chicago/ohare Airport West,1,do nit book this hotel,Dirty hotel with questionable people living in the hotel.

Modern Hotel & Bar,5,King Suite Wedding Getaway,"For our wedding we rented the king balcony suite. The room was spacious and perfect for getting ready.

The bar had excellent cocktails and the in-room coffee was good... More"
Modern Hotel & Bar,4,Modern Oasis,We loved this midcentury hotel. The staff was very nice and they have some rooms that alow pets. The hotel has a small restaurant and bar with hand crafted cocktails and excellent food and a nice but limited wine list
Modern Hotel & Bar,5,"Fun, funky and fabulous",Our one night stay at the Modern was the perfect complement to our introduction to Boise. Hip and retro-modern rooms were beautiful and comfortable (the bed!) and spotless. It's clear a lot of thought was put into curating the guest room experience from the exclusive indie film experience available on the room tv to the door tags. AND we needed... More
Modern Hotel & Bar,5,Just Right,"Makeover was done well and not over the top. Dinner was good. Had the risotto. The chef has a mushroom obsession, so be forewarned. Breakfast was outstanding.

Modern Hotel & Bar,5,June visit 2016,This is the second time that I stayed at this hotel. The rooms have been remodeled and are very modern. Showers are exceptional with good cable TV. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful. Very short drive from the airport and located very close to the downtown action.
Hilton Cleveland Downtown,5,Overnight stay in Cleveland,Great new and clean hotel. Staff is friendly and location is perfect. The only negative is the valet charge of 32/day. I thought that was excessive. I am not sure what the self park cost is since I arrived after midnight and just wanted to go to sleep once I got there.
King George Hotel,3,A Room with NO View,"No restaurant or bar (other than wine/beer). No newspaper availability. Room small, but comfortable... no view. Limited elevator service and somewhat precarious stairs."

Lobby Bar,5,Beautiful and Quiet,Love this hotel. Beautiful lobby and very good restaurants. The coffee in the room was delicious and the maker easy to use-sometimes one must move the coffee maker etc... The best part of the trip is that the hotel is quiet. I couldn't hear other doors in my hallway banging closed.
Lobby Bar,4,acheiving brand loyalty by being proactive,"Someone probably a man and left the toilet seat up and hadn't flushed the toilet. Not a good look and not a comforting thought when you check into a room. My biggest pet peeve is hypoallergenic rooms should be part of a hotels standard capacity. Why should a consumer have to advise the front desk to have someone from housekeeping come in and change out pillows and maybe a comforter. Be proactive not reactive, it makes more the hotel more appealing to consumers and brand loyal"
Lobby Bar,5,GREAT STAY - 2ND STAY HERE IN LAST 2 YEARS,I was in town for a trade show next door at the convention center. Very nice stay. Extremely comfortable bed. Excellent staff. has nice Papasito's on first floor. You can't ask for a better place to stay.

Super friendly staff, rooms are really really clean, delicious hot and cold breakfast items (complimentary) and are replenished the entire time, so you don't get left with the scraps if your running late, 24/7 hot fresh coffee in the lobby, and they even have yummy fresh cookies on the front desk to grab after a long day at the job. It's the small things, like the receptacle outlets located ABOVE the nightstand so you don't have to do furniture reconfigurations to plug in your phone! The internet stays on. Yea, it really stay on all the time with no unexpected drops. Also, the TV is real TV....not the Hotel-Guided limited channel system. So, believe me when I say this is a nice hotel. It really is. ) It's safe....quit looking.....book, now."
Comfort Suites Columbia Gateway,4,Close to the interstate and restaurants,"Check-in went smoothly. Staff was very professional and helpful. The room smelled a bit stuffy and the air conditioner could have used a change in its filter. The room overall was clean tidy. The morning breakfast selection was okay. It offered the waffles and fruit, etc., I wished they had prepared the oatmeal instead of providing instant packets. Some of the fruit was very ripe and not as fresh as it could have been. Plenty of parking and close to the interstate."

Extended Stay America - Detroit/Ann Arbor - University South,3,Beds are hard and floors are not insolated,"The staff was nice, room didn't smell funny like many do. Small repairs were needed. But there is a lot of noise. Could hear everything from above, including walking, and dogs barking....yes..they allow animals. And when people let their door slam it shook the whole room. It happened often. The bed was very hard, and when I turned the fan/heat on it blew the curtain out and away from the window limiting privacy."
Extended Stay America - Detroit/Ann Arbor - University South,3,Good if you seek to stay in an apartment,"While the place is marketed for people looking for a short-term apartment existence, the place definitely held that feel. The lobby was a bit run down but overall not bad. Just"

Best Western Plus Mid Nebraska Inn & Suites,5,Reliable Place to stay,Always a friendly and courteous staff. Very good value for the money.

Dunes Village Resort,4,Nice stay.,Overall I was satisfied with our stay. The only issue I had was the kitchen floor did not appear clean. I spoke to the front desk they apologized and sent a cleaning lady that took care of it immediately. Staff was extremely nice during our stay.
Wilderness On The Lake,4,Getting too pricey for an aging facility,"This has always been one of our family favorites when it comes to a vacation spot in both the summer and winter.

Club Quarters Hotel in Houston,4,1 Night Stay,"Hotel downtown so parking kinda difficult if you choose not to valet park. Hotel appears to be clean well kept.

Price was for weekend was very good. Overall satisfied would recommend/stay again."

Club Quarters Hotel in Houston,4,Nice First Stay,Interesting staying here for the first time. The reception desk is tucked in a small alcove inside the new main door. The room then opens up into a very nice lobby. You need your room key to activate the elevator. The layout of rooms is quite varied. Not just a straight hall with rooms on each side. I was on...

Club Quarters Hotel in Houston,5,Good price for downtown comfortable room.,"Short walk to conference at Minute Made Park, hotel being renovated and I was in a new room that was small but perfect for my needs with a Queen bed, desk and swivel chair, comfortable arm chair, good size shower in adequate size bathroom. Only thing missing was a shelf or stand for my suitcase. A lot of construction in the neighborhood but I heard nothing."
Club Quarters Hotel in Houston,4,Great stay,"The Club Quarters is a good hotel to stay at if you are looking for a place to stay with a good price and within walking distance to clubs and the Toyota center. We were able to take a short 10 minute walk to the Toyota center at night as well as bars and clubs nearby. The only complaint I would have is that parking is not free as the hotel itself does not have a parking area. There is a parking lot nearby where you can pay for meter parking but need to insert cash into the meter every so often which is tricky because you can forget. Valet price wasn't bad, 25 for 24 hours and you can come in and out as many times as you want with no extra charge. We chose this option and it worked out great because we didn't have to worry about our car. Hotel has free water bottles downstairs, a keurig machine in the rooms, a kitchen area with a small fridge, stove and microwave and glassware inside the room, and a coffee machine in the lobby."
Club Quarters Hotel in Houston,5,"Clean, good service, close to convention center.",We picked this hotel for price and location - it's a quick drive to the MFAH and walking distance from the George Brown Convention Center. We had a number of restaurants (mostly chains) and bars within walking distance to choose from. The hotel itself was exactly what we wanted - clean and well staffed. We'd happily stay there again.
Club Quarters Hotel in Houston,4,Modern hotel is good location,"We were in the area for a Cody Jinks concert (he's wonderful is you've never heard of him) and the location was perfect. It is located downtown on Fannin, so also a good location for anyone that might be in Houston for one of the hospitals. Hotel was also very aesthetically pleasing so kudos to whoever is in charge of decor. Rooms were small but other than that I have no complaints. Good bang for your buck and customer service was wonderful!"
Club Quarters Hotel in Houston,4,Location and Value,"Great value and location, Club Quarters is walking distance to Main Street nightlife and half the price of nearby hotels. Valet parking is reasonably priced, property was clean and comfortable, and staff is very friendly. Will definitely stay here again!"
Club Quarters Hotel in Houston,3,Superior room booked,"I had requested a sofa bed in room when i made my reservation and was told it would be available, but was told it was unavailable when I checked in. Also not told that room keys also operated elevators."
Club Quarters Hotel in Houston,5,Fantastic Place to Stay,"The people as we arrived were very courteous and helpful with our luggage, check in was easy, took us to our room and made sure everything was ok with us. We used the shuttle service to go to the ball park, Oscar, was great in getting us there. Check out was easy and our car was waiting on us when we came downstairs, the gentleman outside assisted us in loading up and gave us directions on how to get to where we were going to leave Houston."
Club Quarters Hotel in Houston,4,Definitely worth the price!,I liked the proximity to the ball park. It wasn't a bad walk at all even with a toddler. There is a parking garage for 10 a day diagonally across the street. Even walking back from the ball park at night wasn't bad. The hotel rooms are smaller than the norm but good for the price! There isn't complimentary breakfast or anything like that but there is a cafe one block over. They do have valet parking as well and seemed to be pretty quick. The employees were very friendly. Checking in and out was a breeze-the desk attendant was there to help with the self check in.
Club Quarters Hotel in Houston,4,Eh,"Came to life in color and they charged me 50 because we got a little paint on the shower curtain on towels. No where else. If there is going to be an event like that within 2 miles of your hotel and you put a special price on your hotel that weekend, you have to expect people who attend the event will go to your hotel. 50 is extravagant for a little paint. Also, no parking garage Or else we couldn't find one and got charged another 50 for a garage down the street for ONE NIGHT."
Fairfield Inn Helena,5,excellant,"Best motel I ever stayed in.....there's a lot of motels out there that would not put a patch on your motel,, in fact the first person i seen was so friendly i couldn't believe it One thing that could be better and that is the snow removal from the front of the motel, it was piled up where you drive,...

Pear Tree Inn St. Louis Near Union Station,4,Would stay again,"The hotel was conveniently close to everything. It's close enough to walk downtown but far enough away to be quiet. Clean rooms, friendly staff, and a decent free breakfast made the stay enjoyable. The only negative was that the room I had was a little smaller than I'm used to. Next time I'll get a bigger room."
Pear Tree Inn St. Louis Near Union Station,5,Highly recommended,"Highly recommend this hotel! The check in was hassle free and informative, parking was great in the garage, very clean, super friendly staff, delicious HOT breakfast overall great hotel!"

Hilton Garden Inn Anaheim-Garden Grove,3,Completely fine,"This hotel was fully adequate for our family. It was nothing fancy but it was absolutely fine for what it was.

Hilton Garden Inn Anaheim-Garden Grove,2,Not impressed!,Was not impressed! We only stayed here because it was close to Disneyland on our last night staying in California. We got in close to midnight. I had called to confirm earlier that evening letting them know that we were going to check in late-that was not a problem. Everyone was tired and just wanted to sleep. The A/C was always on. It did not turn off and we tried everything. Beds were uncomfortable-Difficult to sleep. Woke up to make coffee in our room. Coffee maker did not work.

Wyndham Garden Lafayette,3,run down and dark,"This hotel seems to be in the midst of a renovation. They said that they put me in one of their newly renovated rooms, so I would hate to see what the rooms looked like before. The textiles are new, but they should have invested in new mattresses and new AC units. The room felt damp and musty and I would have rather slept on the floor than on the deflated, old, lumpy mattress that they have on the bed. The rooms are extremely dark, even with every light on. I cannot believe that this is considered a 3 star hotel for Expedia. Definitely not! It feel like a motel."
Wyndham Garden Lafayette,3,Comfort for a decent price,"I did not stay in the room a whole lot as I was in town for a conference. My husband, however, came with me and spent most of the day in the room while I was at my conference.

I've stayed in five-star resorts that didn't have this level of customer service. It's a shame they have to work in a facility that they have to make excuses for. The elevator was broken 95 of the time we were here. I had a bad knee and my 82 year old... More"
Norwalk Inn & Conference Center,5,"Nice hotel for the location, very nice staff","We had a nice stay, some family in other rooms near us. Floor was a bit slippery--not from uncleanliness, just wood floors--but otherwise we had a wonderful stay."
Norwalk Inn & Conference Center,5,Excellent conference facilities and a great stay,We stayed at this lovely Inn and hotel for 3 nights while I attended a recent conference also hosted by the hotel. I brought my husband and daughter along to enjoy some Connecticut sun. Location was right off the highway and there is a grocery store and some restaurants nearby. There are choices of churches and temples in the area... More
Norwalk Inn & Conference Center,4,Comfortable bed and delicious bar food,"Spent 1 night at this property stopping through on the way to NYC. The room was spacious. The bed was comfortable with numerous pillows and higher end linens. The mini fridge came stocked with complimentary bottles of water. We had drinks and appetizers in the tavern. While the food was great and the pours were generous, the bartender was less... More"
Norwalk Inn & Conference Center,5,Great Location,I really enjoyed my stay at the Norwalk Inn. The room was beautiful and the staff was so helpful. There was a great restaurant where we had a wonderful family meal. I would definitely give a five-star rating to this hotel. Hoping to come again soon!
Norwalk Inn & Conference Center,2,Spiders in the tub,"I was only there overnight, stayed on first floor. Room was small but adequate. Wallpaper falling off the wall in bathroom. When AC was turned on there was an awful musty, moldy odor. Had to turn it off due to my allergies. The next morning I found a HUGE spider in the bathtub. I don't do well with these things but managed to somehow drown it in the semi hot water the hotel offered. Have to say that that traumatized me a little. Hate spiders, especially big ones. I managed to take a shower after that, always looking around me for more. After I dressed I decided to make a cup of coffee in the room's keurig, poured the creamer that is supplied into the cup. It immediately curdled! When checking the expiration date on the creamer it read 8/11/15 and my stay was on 9/5/15. After that I just packed up and checked out. Receptionist at desk was nice but didn't offer discount for the problems I encountered. Only good thing I can say is the pillows were comfy. Checking this dump off my list."
Norwalk Inn & Conference Center,5,Our week day get away!,My husband has been working hard an hour away from home every week day. I surprised him with this little get away.I had no problem finding this hotel off the highway. Plenty of parking and close to the restaurant we went to. The check in was quick and easy! The lobby and grounds were beautiful and clean. The room was comfortable and had everything we needed for our date night! Thank you so much!
Norwalk Inn & Conference Center,3,Passable for a night,"We appreciated our rest after a very busy day. The bed was very comfortable. The staff in the bar area was also congenial and helpful with a late meal. The room was smaller than I expected, but comfortable enough for one evening. The hotel looked older and could stand some freshening up. The wifi was limited and fairly weak. Lack of a free or reduced breakfast was disappointing."
Norwalk Inn & Conference Center,4,Comfortable and clean,Just off I-95 and reasonably priced. Significant weekend savings on room rates but no free breakfast which is included with most weekday rates. Helpful and courteous staff. Meeting rooms for conferences and social gatherings.
Norwalk Inn & Conference Center,5,Excellent place to stay and eat,"It has prime location among many other places in town , Friendly staff with happy smile to help with all your need , giving ride to anywhere in town . Rooms are very much renovated with all modern facilities"

King Charles Inn,5,A nice one night stay,We stayed at this inn just for one night while visiting the college of Charleston.

King Charles Inn,5,"Central location, good getaway from winter weather","We spent three days here with friends -- sampling restaurants and sightseeing. This hotel is an easy walk to most market street, the Battery and older sections of town. The staff is pleasant, helpful and courtieous. No complaints."
King Charles Inn,5,Best in Charleston,"We go back every other year and always stay here. The location is perfect, the hotel extremely well maintained and the service a cut above. There truly is no other place we would stay when in town. The proximity to the market and restaurants also makes it one of the most convenient."
King Charles Inn,2,Didn't exceed expectations..,"The room was small. Not what was expected for 340.00 a night. My debit card was charged twice and took days to get it reversed. Manager was helpful, but did not offer any other discounts on stay even though it was their fault."
King Charles Inn,4,Noisy but nice room and service,"Love the service and the room was very nice. The only compliant I had is it was very noisy. The air/heat unit made a lot of noise, people slamming doors in the hall and the outside street/parking lot noise was bad."
King Charles Inn,5,Sisters road trip,"I traveled with two of my sisters during a week and a half road trip. We were coming up from Savannah and were staying two nights.

King Charles Inn,4,Dirty Towels,"Everything was great except when we discovered that the cleaning person was putting back dirty towels we placed on the floor, back on the rack. Now I questioned if the bed linens and anything else was actually cleaned. We are deeply disappointed that she would do such a mean and unsanitary act. overall, the other staff were helpful and pleasant."
King Charles Inn,2,Not So Accommodating Accommodations,"I WANTED to love The King Charles Inn because I LOVE Charleston so much. We visit often. We usually stay at the Doubletree Marketplace because we are being cheap, or for a splurge, at Charleston Place, in my opinion, the best place if you don't mind spending money. It's pointless to spend a lot, cause who lingers in their room... More"
King Charles Inn,5,"Gorgeous, Gorgeous, Gorgeous","It was great working with Kristen. Before we even met, I sent her some ideas of what I liked so when she met me at my home, she already had an idea of what I wanted. By the time she left, we had a really great of idea of what we wanted for our wedding invitations. Her... Read More relationships with multiple stationers allowed us to get our Letterpress invitations for almost a third of what we were quoted at other stationary vendors. Once the proof review started, Kristen was on our side as we had to work through a few design issues with our vendor. Kristen made sure we got exactly what we wanted despite having to go through four revisions to get the design just right. Our invitations turned out perfectly. We were getting emails and texts after they all went out saying they were the most original and prettiest invitations they had ever received. Thanks Silver Starfish for setting the stage for the rest of our wedding."
King Charles Inn,5,Beautiful and Great Location,Very trendy hotel in the Charleston downtown. Easy to walk to most attractions. Beautiful lobby and nice staff.

Maxwell Hotel,5,Great hotel- plain and simple,"Stayed at two different hotels in seattle. The maxwell is a gret location for the space needle, seattle center, science center, sculpture garden, etc. another huge benefit was the free parking- which is rare in seattle. The room came with many nice complimentary ammenities- kuerig coffee, popcorn, tea, shuttle rides, etc. For the price- this place was unbeatable."
Maxwell Hotel,5,Great value for money,"Located directly next to the Space Needle and with all kinds of food options nearby, the Maxwell served as an excellent base for discovering Seatlle.

Maxwell Hotel,5,Fresh and fun with teens,This hotel was so roomy and spacious. Real espresso available at the cute little breaky bar in the foyer.

Hawthorn Suites By Wyndham Dayton North,3,Many issues with the room,"We decided to book this hotel for a weekend stay-cation. We are from the Dayton area and knew the miller lane area had plenty of restaurants for our getaway. We have stayed in the south location by the Dayton mall and always enjoy our service, and the room... However, this location seems less organized and not as up kept. The employees parked wherever they wanted, maintenance trucks taking up half the parking lot (not even in spaces) and making it difficult since it was a one way driveway. Also, the bed was VERY hard and uncomfortable, I almost preferred the sofa pull out mattress. Our mirror was cracked, which wouldn't have been a big deal if we didn't have a toddler trying to touch it... And the tub was clogging when we showered. Also, the stove kept randomly turning on.. Yes seriously.. Just clicked on. Our sink faucet had a steady drip as well as the bathroom cold knob did not turn (but the hot water also never got hot)."
Hawthorn Suites By Wyndham Dayton North,1,Convenient Location - but THAT's ALL!,"I stayed last year and room was great. This year - complete opposite. The mattress was bad, the sofa was stain with who knows what!!! It was just a filthy disappointment - as I highly recommended this hotel based on my experience the prior year. I WILL NOT RETURN to this hotel. However, the staff at the front desk was friendly - the only good thing about this stay!!"
Hawthorn Suites By Wyndham Dayton North,4,Quaint,"Staff was very nice, room was not ready but they resolved the issue promptly, love the kitchen and fireplace."
Hawthorn Suites By Wyndham Dayton North,4,RENT A STEAM CLEANER,"The location is very, very inconvenient, but I am sure that is nothing they can help, it is just how the city has grown around their location. I would have rated the room as a 4 or 5 for clean if the sofa was not so disgusting. I literally covered it with a sheet just to sit on it. There was not one inch of surface that was not covered with a greasy/dirty stain. I would have switched rooms if I hadn't already unloaded all of my stuff in the rain before I turned on the lights to reveal the nasty sofa. Otherwise, the room was clean and comfortable. It would be worth a couple of hundred dollars to get a steam cleaner and clean the sofas in each room. Not to mention how unsanitary it is."
Hawthorn Suites By Wyndham Dayton North,2,"Carpet was filthy, flies everywhere, no shower curtain air...","Carpet was filthy, flies everywhere, no shower curtain air conditioner keep cutting off, and the bed was hard"

Red Roof Inn Allentown Airport,1,Terrib;e,For some reason according to the front desk the regular queen room booked from Hotels.com gave us a handicap room.

Hampton Inn & Suites Little Rock-downtown,5,Great downtown hotel for business and leisure,"Located in downtown Little Rock, I found myself only steps away from restaurants and other activities offered by this city. For frequent travelers, it's on par with what you would expect from the Hampton brand, added with some very friendly and helpful staff. Definitely my pick in Little Rock in the future."
The Inn At Crested Butte,4,Cozy stay in a beautiful little town,After traveling all over Colorado I'd have to say that Crested Butte is one of the prettiest places in the state. The Inn at Crested Butte is two blocks off the main drag and in a perfect location to be quiet but close enough to everything. One of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in away from home too.... More
The Inn At Crested Butte,5,Excellent Inn in the heart of CB.,"What a wonderful hotel.

They left us all the details we... More"
The Inn At Crested Butte,2,Overpriced Hotel with Meager Ammenties,"Room was adequate, but the hotel needs maintenance bad. Porch deck was dirty, the outdoor carpeting was awful...don't walk without shoes! The weeds at the hotel entrance were an indication of how they maintain the rest of the hotel. Breakfast was granola, milk, OJ, and store bought stale cake...no fruit or anything. Staff goes home early so don't have a... More"

Austria Haus Hotel,5,"Location, Ambiance and Great views","Recently, enjoyed with my family and grandchildren 3 nights at this quaint beautiful centrally located hotel. Our room was beautiful and although facing the front of the property, we had a beautiful view of the mountains. The flower boxes were so beautiful hanging on the small patio opening of our room. Hummingbirds flew on the window boxes taking nectar from the petals. It was very wonderful to see. The rooms are large and all accommodations were much like a 5+ hotel. Beautifully decorated we were very pleased with our rooms. We especially enjoyed the valet parking and Eric who was so helpful. The check in process was easy and accommodated our early check-in wishes. The European style breakfast was enjoyable with plenty of food to fill you up for a early day of shopping sight seeing and photo opportunity. Walk literally out the door and you are welcomed by the abundance of shopping and restaurants. We will most certainly book this hotel again."

Grand Prix Motel,5,Very good stay,We booked at Grand prix Motel last minute for Jeep week 2016. I was a little skeptical due to the stories you hear about outdated motels and the few bad reviews.

Wingate By Wyndham Oklahoma City Airport,3,ok stay,I was not too impressed with the hot tub or breakfast. Besides a clean room and comfortable bed those two things are important to me. One morning they were out of items at breakfast.
Wingate By Wyndham Oklahoma City Airport,5,Nice Hotel to Relax,"The hotel and staff were great! There is a lot of construction in the area, so that made it hard to see the hotel as well as arriving/leaving due to traffic."

Wingate By Wyndham Oklahoma City Airport,1,Very disappointed with this hotel .Hotel .com doe!,I was very disappointed with my stay . I was charged 270.00 dollars to my credit card for so called damage. I call to see what they were talking about and ask for pictures to be sent to my e mail .and ask to speak to Manger. Got the run around got hung up on after trying to see what they were talk about . Because room was left very clean . We only took a shower and slept we didn't even use anything else in are room. All towels were left in bathroom in a pile after we used them bed was clean . Are room was left in tact . They haven't refund my money back and has not show me what so called damages. So be aware of their scam !
Wingate By Wyndham Oklahoma City Airport,3,Wingate in OKC,I seemed like the Hotel is under going renovations. The road in front of the property is under going serious construction. One of the exterior doors to the Hotel never did not open from the outside. The air conditioner in the room was so noisy I did no sleep well the first few nights. The first day the maids failed to clean the room. We had to go to the front desk to get clean towels.
Wingate By Wyndham Oklahoma City Airport,3,Oklahoma City,There was a roach crawling around the coffee maker/microwave area when I walked into the room after check in. The shower caulking had a lot of mold.
Wingate By Wyndham Oklahoma City Airport,3,Family vacation,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights for a family trip. Good stay, breakfast wasn't great, pool needs a major cleaning room was really muggy, there was construction everywhere around that area but we were able to get around fine. Not far from bricktown which is where we spent most of our time. Good for a quick stay but I wouldn't prefer to stay for more than a day."

Crowne Plaza Hotel Nashua,1,This is a Crown Plaza,"This had to be the worst Crown Plaza I have ever stayed. I stayed 2 nights to attend a wedding and I didn't sleep at all. Aside from the tired/boring decor, the room had a supposed queen bed that really should be classified as full size with a mattress harder than a sidewalk and pillows flatter than a short stack...

The Maritime Hotel,5,The Maritime Hotel: Great hotel choice for Chelsea,"I stayed at The Maritime Hotel on May 21-22, 2016. It is a stylishly appointed space throughout, from the lobby to the restaurant to the rooms. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful both check in and check out were a breeze. They'll hold your bags for you if your room isn't ready at the time you check in and they'll hold them for you even after you check out if your check out time is earlier than when you're finally ready to leave Chelsea. Incredibly convenient location to lots of restaurants and activities, including the Highline. The hotel is also right across the street from The Chelsea Market, which is terrific shopping experience. I highly recommend booking The Maritime if you plan to stay in the Chelsea neighborhood. The only caveat I have is bring earplugs for sleeping, or some kind of white noise generator to drown out the sound of car horns honking all night. Other than that, it was a great stay."
The Maritime Hotel,5,Great Hotel in a great neighborhood of NYC!,"Loved the hotel, perfect location for shopping at Chelsea Market and walking the Highline. I plan to stay here again soon!"
The Maritime Hotel,3,NYC weekend,"Very dark/ limited lighting. Shower handle fell off, room keys not working,.. Back down to the desk for new ones 2x, hotel steamer used for getting wrinkles out of black tie suit/ gown was overfilled w/ water and puddled in the room,... But staff responded quickly/ apologetically. Nice indoor/ outdoor space for complimentary breakfast and appetizers in am/ pm. Great location kitty corner to Chelsea Market, near Highline Park, Chelsea Pier"
The Maritime Hotel,4,Solid hotel in Chelsea,The Maritime hotel is very nice. The room was small but clean and well accommodating.
The Maritime Hotel,5,Great option for this part of the City,"Needed a hotel near the West Village and with parking -- this was perfect. Hotel is very chic, and room was comfortable with lots of storage which offset its small size. Will definitely be using this hotel again in the future."
The Maritime Hotel,5,Love the Maritime Hotel!,"Our stay was perfect - from the moment we checked in. The staff were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the happy hour - great selection of wine and snacks. The room was nice - NYC small but had everything we needed. The bathroom had everything - including bubble bath and toothpaste! Who does that We liked the neighborhood - haven't stayed in Chelsea before, but it was a great location. We cabbed it to Broadway for dinner and a show, but also did lots of walking - including up to the Natural History Museum. It was a short stay, but we can't wait to go back to the Maritime Hotel!"
The Maritime Hotel,4,"Lovely, comfortable hotel is perfect location","Just stayed for 1 night because a friend was coming in from out of town. Unable to check-in early, but got a call as soon as the room was ready. Room was very clean. Small, but nicely appointed and comfortable. Nice bathroom, aside from some trouble in turning on the cold water for the sink (handle was difficult to turn). It also took a long time for the shower to warm up. Free wifi is excellent in this hotel."
The Maritime Hotel,2,It's not for me,The overdone maritime theme makes this place creepy. Everything is painted dark blue--it's overwhelming and depressing.
The Maritime Hotel,4,Beautiful Hotel - Great Neighborhood,"We stayed for two nights at the Maritime Hotel. The location is great, being right across the street from the Chelsea Market with lots of great food. Close to subway station. The lobby is cozy and well appointed with tables, books, long couches and a fireplace blazing all the time. The room was small, but beautiful with wood finishes and a large round window (which opened - a definite plus). I will definitely stay here again."

Warwick Seattle Hotel,4,Convenience,"We wanted to be able to walk to all Seattle's many attractions because we had been told parking is a problem. This fit the bill. Four short blocks from Pikes Market. Walking distance from Space Needle, Pioneer Square and Ferry Terminal for anyone who likes to walk. Mostly flat except for last block going down to Pikes Market."
Warwick Seattle Hotel,2,To Hot,The room was to hot and no remedy was offered and the service at breakfast was inadequate. At 4 a cup I expect my coffee refilled without having to chase down a waiter. (We were the second customer in the restaurant that morning.) The same is true of water refills.
Warwick Seattle Hotel,5,"Girlfriends getaway...great locale, very comforable stay!","Stayed two nights with two girlfriends in a room with 2 queen beds.

Warwick Seattle Hotel,4,Warwick Seattle Hotel,"My room was spacious, immaculately clean, and pleasantly decorated. All the staff members were friendly, welcoming and efficient.

"The Westin Poinsett, Greenville",3,Rehearsal Dinner/Reception,"I have told the Westin I am going to leave honest feedback on my experience and will do so. First, the hotel is beautiful. Guests commented on the amazing and historic beauty it had to offer. Rooms are a bit pricey, but comparable to other hotels in downtown Greenville. In fact,... Read More rooms in the room block here were cheaper than what other hotels were going to offer in blocks. The complimentary night for the wedding was an added plus. We had our reception in the Gold Ballroom and that, too, was a great location site. It was stunning and if you want a reception in a ballroom, I wouldn't have anything negative to say about it. I caution you if you plan on solely relying on the hotel's event planner. While she sets up everything for you (or instructs the staff, I'm not entirely sure), I still had a day of coordinator and do not regret that choice one bit. My DOC had to fix the centerpieces since they did not match the pictures provided. Also, my DOC was present through the ENTIRE reception. The hotel's planner typically does not stay until the end of the reception and also was not there Sunday during our departure to help us locate some of our items. The hotel's planner is not consistently present during the reception, especially if there is another wedding or event in the hotel. She is present only here and there, but not consistently. We had an issue with our champagne toast and had to send my DOC to try to locate the hotel's planner or anyone to help. Overall, the hotel's planner was useful in organizing the details, planning food, etc. She ensured the timeline generally flowed and we got to where we needed to be. At times, communication was hard and responses to questions were delayed. The overall package price, in my opinion, was helpful. Next, we had issues with the clean up of the event, which is part of the package. The staff told my DOC they were not going to pack up the reception decor, which resulted in my DOC, father, and several groomsmen spending an hour or two packing up the items and then carrying them to my father's room. As the hotel planner was not there at the end of the reception, there was no one to talk to about what was happening. Needless to say, the end result was a DOC I needed to compensate for time outside our contract and a not very pleased Father of the Bride. After some pressing to the Westin, compensation was given for this. I can at least give them credit for rectifying a wrong though it did take some pushing. For reception food, it was fantastic. We had many compliments on the steak, sides, etc. The staff was attentive and the bar service was quick. My father had lots of positive things to say about the staff and especially liked Eric. Eric is a jack of all trades - he was the bartender at the rehearsal, bell hop at various points, waiter at the reception, van driver on Sunday. If you have Eric doing anything, you are in good hands. We also had a fantastic server, JJ, at the wedding - we loved her, too. The Westin suggested doing wine passing during dinner and closing the bar as a cost saver. In the end, this was more expensive than simply doing another hour for the open bar. You are charged taxes, gratuity, and services fees for this hour though the contract states this is part of the package; this was an issue and I'm still not in agreement that it was right since it was never mentioned. Think twice about this option. Most of our decor was returned - a few items were missing."

Similarly, no parking valet despite awkward parking situation. No dedicated concierge although desk staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. The included breakfast buffet was nice in appearance, but very poor in quality."
Drury Inn Suites San Antonio Riverwalk,5,Wonderful hotel,We stayed for our 25th wedding anniversary and the room was great. Huge bed and very comfy. The room was clean and everyone was so nice. You get free drinks and food at 5:30 which I thought was great. It was a wonderful stay and we will definatly visit again.
Drury Inn Suites San Antonio Riverwalk,4,"Loved the room, hated the parking and no bellhops","Although my hotel rooms was great and the location was great there were a few things that will cause me not to return. The PARKING which they charged me 16 a day was horrible. The spots are so small that compact cars barely fit much less an intermediate or an ever so popular SUVs. Everyone went over the line making it impossible to find a spot and if you were lucky enough to find a spot and get into it, you couldn't get out of your car, most of the time it took me 15-30 minutes to park just because of the lot. The other thing I didn't like was no help with bags. They provided you with carts, but then there were stairs you had put your things in a dummy elevator and send them up or down and being an older person the maneuvering of the cart itself was cumbersome."
Red Parrot Cafe @ Breakers Resort,5,Girls Getaway,The weather was amazing. The parking garage is challenging. All in all a great trip.
Red Parrot Cafe @ Breakers Resort,4,Great view of beach.,"Stayed here for 4 nights booked an ocean front room on 14 th floor, suite was basic and had a great view, nothing special, but had all we needed , comfortable bed , small efficient, kitchenette and a room with a great view of the beach.

Hampton Inn Suites Dallas-Arlington North-Entertainment District,3,Terrible sofa sleeper,"Hotel was nice and King suite room was large however, sofa sleeper mattress was beyond horrible. Completely worn and not sleep able. Very disappointed in that when traveling with a child. He had to sleep on the sofa instead."
Hampton Inn Suites Dallas-Arlington North-Entertainment District,5,"Hampton - Arlington, TX",The entire excellent experience started with general manager Lourdes Yanouri. We had 7 people in our group (and stayed 3 nights) and she immediately handled all of the reservations and made sure we had all of the confirmations by email. They were waiting on us when we got there - the clerk even knew we were coming. The rooms are... More
Days Inn Portage,3,Friendly staff,"The front desk staff was very pleasant and and helpful. We enjoyed the hot breakfast, internet worked well, and the room was clean but a little on the small size with the cramped sink area. It would be nice if maintenance adjusted the door checks as we grew quite annoyed with other guests that kept letting their doors slam."
Days Inn Portage,1,It needs some major remodel,Not particularly clean. Bathrooms very small with small toilets. Front desk clerk very polite. no elevators. Breakfast was decent. No elevators. Repairs needed.
Days Inn Portage,4,Quick Overnight Stay in Room 116,The Days Inn Portage was just what I needed for a very quick overnight stay in the area before an event. The room was comfortable and I thought the rate was very reasonable for the area. The pool looked nice and I was sorry I didn't bring a swimsuit even though I didn't have time! The front desk was very... More
The Niantic Inn,3,"The good, the bad and the ugly.","While our overall 2 night stay was not unpleasant and the location is excellent if you wish to be in town, there were a few things that would have made our stay much more relaxing while we were there.

Americas Best Value Inn-weatherford,1,The most repulsive place I have ever had to lodge,"This room should have been advertised for 19. I can't believe I spent 80 on this place! For starters, the sheets looked unclean, and when we pulled the blankets back the pillows beneath were -covered- in an assortment of straight and curly black hairs. I'm sure they haven't been laundered for centuries. There were moth wings melted into the insides... More"
Village Inn & Suites,2,Way to pricey,"Lobby is clean and fresh smelling as is elevator. Room was mostly clean, but not clean smelling. Breakfast offered is coffee, fruits or a quarter piece of muffin and you have to eat it in the tiny closet sized room that has a tv few tables, not allowed to take the food to your room. The price for mid... More"
Village Inn & Suites,1,Worst possible customer service!,I was not impressed with this motel when I stayed there - the breakfast was very mediocre and the toilet didn't want to flush.

Village Inn & Suites,3,"If you like waking up to a train honking its horns like crazy at 4 AM, then this is your thing","This place needs a serious reno to stay alive. I booked with Expedia, specifically asked for 3 people in one room. The hotel still charged me 5 bucks extra for that, when we arrived. I think the admin costs of doing that was more than what that 5 bucks covered. Not very smart. We arrived late, around 3:30 AM, and... More"
Hyatt Place Dallas Plano,5,Definitely Would Come Again,The staff was very friendly and helpful. We enjoy the room layout because of the extra living space to hang out in. We also love the Reese's cookies as an evening treat! They are so yummy warmed up.
Hyatt Place Dallas Plano,5,Perfect deal,"Needed to be close to family at a reasons price. Hyatt was perfect for that. I wish the bathroom was a little bit bigger. And I wish the fridge was a little bit colder. Other than those two things, my room was perfect. One elevator was out but it didn't make much difference. Rode the elevator alone most of the time. Didn't seem too crowded in there. There's always someone at the lobby desk with a smile. In the middle of the night, you wouldn't expect that but all the staff I met were super nice and accommodating. I'd stay here again for sure."
Hyatt Place Dallas Plano,4,Good Hotel in Plano,"We enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The room was a good size and clean. The service at the hotel was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was good but nothing special - eggs, sausage, toast, cereal, juice, etc."

My room and the hotel in general seemed to be showing their age, but everything was still comfortable and clean. I... More"
Baton Rouge Marriott,3,Disappointing,I chose this hotel which is one of the more expensive as I was travelling alone and it advertised two restaurants and close proximity to shopping. Not true! Restaurant was only open for breakfast and the food in the bar was woeful (same food offered for room service). - imagine processed burger cheese on French onion soup and you get... More
Baton Rouge Marriott,3,"Average to Fair, Renovation Upcoming","This Baton Rouge Marriott is centrally located to highways, central business center, restaurants and shopping. The hotel is clean and staff are polite and helpful. The hotel itself is extremely outdated and drab. In the hotels defense, the advertise their upcoming renovation. Try to avoid rooms facing the highway if you are in need of a quite nights sleep."
Seaside Inn,2,Not what we expected,"We have previously stayed at the Palms Hotel with a beachfront room, but they are closed all summer for renovations, so we went a couple of buildings down to Seaside Inn expecting a smaller room but similar accommodations, so much of this critique is comparing Seaside to the Palms. We had a beachfront room and although the balcony was spacious... More"

Hampton Inn Myrtle Beach-Northwood,3,3 day stay at Hampton Inn Myrtle beach northwood,"Average stay, average hotel, nothing much to say.

Days Inn Fort Wayne,3,OK for single night stay.,The staff was very friendly and courteous. Sleeping was difficult due to nearby highway and hvac unit noise. TV and Internet worked well.

Days Inn Fort Wayne,3,Just adequate,"Well, on a whole the room was clean and the bed was comfortable but the fitted top sheet kept coming off on both sides of our bed. The TV was very good, it had a frig and microwave which we always appreciate. The room was 122 and I could hear the traffic (hubby sleeps with ear plugs), I had to keep the fan on the air conditioner on to drown out the noise. WiFi was great. Breakfast, we grabbed a couple bananas, coffee and left as it was really sparse."
Hampton Inn Suites Detroit-Canton,5,"Hampton in Canton, MI",I am a Hilton Diamond member and this is one of the best Hamptons I have stayed in for quite some time.

Hampton San Diego-Kearny Mesa,4,Meets my needs,"Staff very friendly. For most part wall and TV muffled tantrum in next room, but not quite as well as I'd like. Treadmill was out of service when I went in, but other equipment was available. Staff responded well to reported issue. Road construction may have caused my neighborhood rating to be lower than it should."
Hampton San Diego-Kearny Mesa,4,"Quiet, Safe Location","Quiet neighborhood. Less than 10 miles to Sea World, Old Town, and Seaport Village. Double bed rooms do NOT have a sofa sleeper, as indicated when I booked (should be changed by now). We've stayed at several hotels in this chain, and we've always had a sofa sleeper and, usually, queen beds. Hotel staff was very accommodating, though, when I discovered this and they came up with a satisfactory solution. Breakfast is good, although very crowded."

Inn At The 5th,5,Excellent experience,"We stayed here for the third time for our 5th anniversary. This hotel is definitely expensive for the area, but well worth the price. It's the kind of place where you want to luxuriate in the hotel itself, not just a bed for the night."
Inn At The 5th,5,Exceptional Hotel,"While bicycling across the US, my wife and I stayed at the Inn at the 5th. The bike was welcomed in our room, which is not always the case at such upscale hotels. The staff is great, the room was perfect and the location is excellent."

Inn At The 5th,5,Another wonderful stay at Inn at the 5th,"As is always the case, my stay here was seamless, comfortable and all services are graciously offered and handled with great care.

The Benson Hotel,3,"old fashioned and nice, but old build shows in some places","ote: 3 stars means a slightly above average grade, similar to a C+ in academics As most reviews note, this is a very historic/rustic building and thus should not be directly compared to other modern 4 diamond hotels with much newer buildings, plumbing, furniture, etc. That said, once you get past the lobby of the Benson, the concern to keep...

The bathroom was nicely updated... More"
The Benson Hotel,4,Beautiful historic property,I was blown away by the lobby and halls. Our room was less than spectacular as it was a hotel tonight booking and probably was the last room in the building overlooking an alley. Even so the small room we had was well worth the money and did the trick.
The Benson Hotel,5,A perfect first stop on our honeymoon.,My wife and I stayed here for the first three nights of our honeymoon and had a great time. The hotel has a lot of character and history which we felt made the experience that much more unique. And the lobby bar was magical.

We received a warm welcome from Kate when we... More"
Best Western Black Hills Lodge,3,"Tired Decor, But Clean, Comfortable Accommodations",The decor of this hotel needs to updated as it was a little tired and outdated but we had a clean room and bathroom and a comfortable bed and in the end we don't ask for more than that. The location put us in close proximity to the areas we wanted to visit.
Comfort Inn,2,Poor job cleaning,So I stayed here for one night in room 114 (their only king 1 bedroom suit) and it was ok but looked like they just gave it a quick once over after the last guest stayed. Didn't think much of it as I was planning on checking out in the morning. I also noticed a small stain on one of... More
Holiday Inn Ft. Lauderdale-Airport,4,Amazing pool area for summer,I picked this hotel due to the airport shuttle mostly. The hotel had exterior renovations underway that impacted parking but not the stay. Friendly staff at check in. Then I noticed the nice outdoor pool. Later (after dark) the pool was packed. Lots of people enjoying the area. Very lively. My room was typical Holiday Inn. Upgraded nicely. Just barely... More
Holiday Inn Ft. Lauderdale-Airport,5,Great for a layover,"Used this hotel for an overnight before a cruise. It was very welcoming, the shuttle to the hotel from FLL was easy to contact and meet up with and a gas station next door was useful for grabbing a quick something. ( the nearby McDonald's is a whole other story). Nothing else nearby but for a stop over it worked... More"
Holiday Inn Ft. Lauderdale-Airport,5,We loved it!,"I took my son and daughter to Miami Sunny Isles Beach for the Surfers Healing event. This was our very first time in Miami. Being a single mom, I couldn't afford the hotels on the beach and I wanted one with a great pool, at a decent price. I was able to find this one at a GREAT price and it appeared to have a nice pool as well. This hotel was awesome! Friendly staff, very clean room, and the beds were very comfortable as well. I had to use room service once, and they were prompt. Free parking and WIFI as well. The kids LOVED it and said that it was really nice. We would stay again if we ever come back to the area."
Holiday Inn Ft. Lauderdale-Airport,1,Don't bother.,Free parking. That's the only positive experience here. Any more than 1 night would have canceled found different hotel. Hotel had a funky smell in lobby and room was musty smelling too. Good thing the air conditioner was good and loud it blocked the street noise. Stayed at few holiday Inn express and they've been decent. Not so much here and they charge more rooms at the big H.I. Overall impression...not impressed.
Holiday Inn Ft. Lauderdale-Airport,4,Great Hotel for pre/post cruise,"We stayed here after our cruise and chose this hotel because of its free shuttle and restaurant on site. Our room was larger than expected and cozy, we were able to get an early check in without calling ahead, and were in our room by 11am. The pool area is nice and clean, staff was helpful. Would stay here again."
Holiday Inn Ft. Lauderdale-Airport,5,Incredible front desk staff,"We were just staying overnight en route to the Bahamas. When we arrived at nearly 1 am, we discovered that our reservation did not exist, our travel provider had instead booked us into a hotel in Baltimore in April. Luckily for us, night auditor Dalia came to our rescue. She worked non-stop for an hour, speaking to the call centre,... More"
Holiday Inn Ft. Lauderdale-Airport,3,HOLIDAY INN,We were not able to stay in the hotel for the two nights and went in to cancel only to be told we did not make rez with hotel as we thought we did.

Best Western Kings Quarters,2,Close to Kings Dominion,Not great
Best Western Kings Quarters,2,If you can afford it; book another hotel,"The only good thing about this hotel is the proximity to Kings Dominion. I will be driving to the park next time. The hotel is right next to the highway, which for me is a security concern. The staff was not overly friendly. The room is a bed and shower, not overly nice, or clean. If you are looking for a place to sleep and shower only (not your most comfortable stay) OR cannot afford a nicer hotel this is the place for you. Although the attached Denny's is convenient, it is dirty and we were served cold food. Hope this helps make your decision."
Best Western Kings Quarters,4,family fun,Would stay again. Enjoyed our stay. Only problem was we had no refreg. or microwavE in one of the rooms. The trolley to kings dominion was not always available. Waited for 45 minutes and then I walked. Enjoyed the dog kennel on kings dominion site.
Best Western Kings Quarters,3,Convenient location but not very impressed,"Both the pool and the tiki bar were not open during our stay, which was a huge disappointment. The bathtubs were not very clean either. Location is very convenient as you can save parking fees by walking to Kings Dominion."
Best Western Kings Quarters,1,Absolutely Disturbing,"I was please to see how close the hotel was to Kings Dominion (across the street) and a Denny's right next door. The good points ended there, however. Upon entering the room, we noticed lots of white hairs on the floor, so we requested that the floor be vacuumed. I requested a rollaway and we started to set it up after we came back from the amusement park. When I opened it, I found a blood stain on the mattress cover. The front desk was alarmed by the finding, but suggested we cover it with sheets (really). I had them take it away, so my little cousin ended up sleeping in the chair. Much later that night, the toilet was stopped up, but maintenance was to busy to fix it, so a plunger was delivered for us to do it. The toilet kept running the entire night. The following morning the toilet overflowed, so we weren't able to shower and we checked out. Each incident was reported to the front desk and we received a 20 discount, which was unsatisfactory given all of the issues encountered. Hotels.com helped to resolve the issue. Thank you Hotels.com! I would never stay at this location again. I would rather drive a few more miles to get the amusement park, than have the convenience of being close yet sacrifice great service."
Best Western Kings Quarters,3,Not handicap facility,We asked for a handicap room. We got a room on the first floor. Not very handicap accessible. No grab bars in the bathroom. Not handicap accessible for wheelchair person. Very little room. Got the first floor. but other than that not very helpful. Front desk did not seem to care either. I undertand you cannot guarantee a room. But this was not a enjoyable experience. The restaurant was good and very accommodating.
Best Western Kings Quarters,5,was a great trip,loved it here will go again

Americana Hotel,2,Scruffy But Clean,"We decided to try the Americana Hotel for a night. Pluses: clean room, comfortable bed, nice TV with lots of cable.

Siena Suites,4,"6 people, 1 room","I have 4 teens. So there were 6 of us in a room. That get cramped! This two bedroom suite had 2 (!) bathrooms and a kitchen. NO one slept on the floor. It was awesome! Tons of room to spread out, we weren't tripping over each other."
Siena Suites,3,Roomy hotel but pretty worn,"The room was not bad, but the couch was so worn we practically sat on the floor. It was also pretty stained. The bedspread was also very worn and starting to get holes in it. The beds were kinda hard. It did have 2 full bathrooms and a full kitchen including dish washer!!! I felt safe and the room was easy to find. Map quest did put us at the back of the hotel though, and it was kind of confusing to get up to the front office. Overall it wasn't bad. It was clean. It just needs a few furniture updates."

Quality Inn Suites,3,Somewhere to lay your head if you only need one night,"First of all, keep in mind that this is a budget hotel. The front desk was very nice and check in was an easy process.

Quality Inn Suites,4,Close enough to Tallahassee,"We stayed here for five nights while looking at properties outside Tallahassee. For the price we paid through Hotels.com, 47 a night, it was a no brainer. It was clean, a free hot breakfast every morning, staff was courteous, and on our downtime one day, we had the whole, well kept pool, all to ourselves for 2 hours."
Quality Inn Suites,4,Return Trip from MS.,"We find this Best Western a pleasant place to stop on our way home from Ms. The room is clean and the bed is comfortable. They enlarged the Breakfast room which made it less crowded to enjoy our breakfast, which is very good and we will stay there again."

Hampton Inn West Palm Beach Central Airport,5,Very nice for the price,"I had no complaints and would stay again. I have stayed at several different Hampton Inns and this was as nice as any others I've I stayed.

Hampton Inn West Palm Beach Central Airport,5,Excellent motel and location,"This motel was close to the airport and only a short drive from a shopping mall and many fine restaurants. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The whole facility was very well kept and having cold, fruit flavored water available in the lobby was very refreshing in hot July. We would certainly stay here again."
Motel 6,4,Convenient with Micro and Fridge,My wife and I have stayed in several Motel 6s this year and this one is mostly average with the exception that it has a microwave and refrigerator which is a big plus.

The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,Location,Location. Difficult to find a bellhop to assist with luggage.
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Great location,"Loved the location - was able to walk to everything in the historical area.  Hotel was very well maintained.  Staff was friendly.  Had some issues with valet but other than that, loved the hotel."

The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Nice hotel with great location,"I was extremely happy with the location of the hotel, it is located in the heart of historic Charleston with everything within walking distance. The hotel was clean, staff was friendly, and the decor was charming."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Great Hotel,The stay was great! Only complaint (not really) was we were too close to King Street where my wife spent a lot of money. Location was very convenient to all the sights and restaurants we targeted. Hotel staff was very helpful in explaining the best way to arrange our trip to Ft. Sumter.
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Great hotel in the center of all the action,We had a great time in Charleston. The location of the Mills House was ideal. We parked our car and walked to all the attractions for the next 3 days. We needed the car once and it was brought to us in a timely manner. The staff was courteous and helpful. We were spoiled by everyone. Looking forward to staying at the Mills House again.
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,Great location in historic district,"I have stayed at this hotel several times. It has a great location 1/12 blocks from Broad Street. The public area are very nice, and the staff is helpful and friendly. The rooms are nicely sized and well furnished. My only complaint is that the walls provide very little barrier to sound. We could easily hear the people in the adjoining room and the hallway. With a number of weddings going on the sound level was probably more than typical, however, be aware that your room could be noisy depending on who you are adjacent to."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,Charleston is a must see,"Everything was great except for the, way too high, parking fee. We walked just about everywhere in the historic district. Great city with history galore."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Great Location & Great Hotel,"This hotel was in a terrific location.  Walking distance from all sights.  The hotel staff was very accommodating. We arrived very early in the morning and they had a room for us.  Our flight out was late in the day, so they held our luggage and also called for our cab service to the airport, which arrived right on schedule."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,Posh but not cheap,"The Mills House is a very old hotel in Charleston that has been nicely updated to the modern age. It is really close to just about everything. If you can stay here during the week it is actually pretty reasonable but it gets really expensive on weekends. Except for the cost however we found little to complain about. The staff is very attentive and the rooms are comfortable and quiet. My only complaint was that the breakfast, though good, was nothing special."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,"Friendly, convenient hotel.","This hotel was a great pic. The staff is very friendly, helpful, and seem to love their jobs. Even the maids had big smiles on their faces. The hotel itself is elegant and cozy, with a great bar and restaurant, nice outdoor courtyard, great pool and outdoor patio area, and small but nice rooms. Comfortable beds. The bathrooms could use more counter space and towel racks, but are clean and updated. Hotel location is great and is within walking distance to everything. The valet parking is expensive (~$29 a day) which is a pet peeve of mine - I think the parking should always be included. However the valet staff is also very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,2,Rude staff,"The lobby was nice, but the room was small and the bathroom was dirty. The room didn't have a small refrigerator which I was shocked to find. So much for my leftovers. The woman when we checked in and out was standoffish. Good things about the hotel: the bed was comfortable and the location was nice. After arriving home I discovered a charge on my card from the hotel. I didn't do anything to incur a charge so I called them to ask about it. The woman on the phone was unbelievably rude! She transferred me to a voicemail where one of my options was to press zero for personal assistance (which is why I called). I was rerouted to the same woman who now seemed incredibly frustrated by me and insisted I leave a voicemail. She transfers me again. I just thought she could have been more polite and accommodating. I did get the issue sorted out, but the attitude of the woman on my initial phone call left a bad taste in my mouth. The location of this hotel is great, but the hotel itself isn't nice enough for the rate and the staff could use a lesson in manners and service."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,"Phantastic Hotel in the ""Holy City""","Phantastic location in Charleston Historic District. The hotel comes along with ""Sothern Comfort"" and a historic 18th Century flair mixed with modern amenities. Shoping and dining locations are a few yards around the corner in King Street and Market Street. Charlestons historic houses start right across the street going south on Meeting Street. Definitely a great destination to stay at for a Charleston visit!!!"
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,Great hotel,"Great hotel all around. Friendly service, very clean and quiet with a convenient location. Highly recommend!"
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Great Location,Me and my 13 yr. old daughter loved the hotel. The staff was great and very freindly.... the were not totally booked and they gave us a cool room overlooking the pool. They also allowed us a later than usual checkout... never know until you ask. We also enjoyed the cute workout room and the excellent breakfast buffet.Thanks Mills House for making my daughters spring break a success!!!
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Stadthotel,"Das Mill's House Hotel ist fr mich ein typisches durchschnittliches Stadthotel. Das Zimmer war eher klein aber mit guten Betten. Die Einrichtung war hbsch, ausreichend und sauber. Da das Zimmer zum Innenhof lag war es sehr ruhig; der Pool war geschlossen, obwohl es zum Baden noch warm genug gewesen wre.Das Restaurant hatte die Grsse einer Bahnhofshalle und hat uns nicht zum Bleiben 'verfhrt'. Gerade nebenan gab es ein wundervolles Restaurant mit guter Bedienung und gutem Essen.Die Bar bzw. die Lobby und auch der Innenhof mit seinem Brunnen sieht gemtlich und einladend aus.Das Hotel liegt ideal fr alle Sehenswrdigkeiten in Fussgnger-Nhe. Empfehlenswert ist der Gang ber die Kingsstreet mit seinen vielfltigen Lden und der Besuch der Villengegend im French-Quarter. Nicht besuchenswert ist der 'Market' - eine reine Touristenfalle.Wer nur kurz in Charleston verweilt, kann dieses Hotel als Ausgangsstation buchen - ich kann es empfehlen.Nebenbei: Savannah ist hnlich wie Charleston aber lebendiger und vielfltiger. Ich wrde vermutlich eher in Savannah ein Hotel suchen und lnger bleiben, und Charleston nur im Vorbeifahren besichtigen."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,3,dissapointing,"elevator broken entire stay, one hour ten minute wait for one hamburger in restaurant, mgr in restaurant quite rude at times."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,2,Book in advance and arrive to no room!,We booked and paid in full a month in advance. We arrived late to be greeted by front desk telling us we had no room available. It was common practice to overbook. We spent 2 of our 3 days moving from hotel to hotel as a result. They did not even call us ahead of time to tell us to check In elsewhere.  Instead of a refund for the inconvienance the Manager gave us 2 free drink tickets and offered a free nights stay later. Horrible custom service and practice!
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Excellent!,"Just stayed at The Mills House with 3 girlfriends, it was wonderful. It is a beautiful hotel and close to the historic district. Didn't want to leave! Couldn't have been more perfect."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,Very pleasant weekend!,"Very pleased with our overall stay. For the most part, staff friendly and helpful especially the concierge. We were disappointed with the menu at the Barbados Room. We were hoping to just enjoy a nice dinner upon our arrival and were not prepared to go searching for a reservation outside the hotel after a day of traveling. After reviewing the menu, we realized there was no real ""dinner"" menu. Just sandwiches and pizza etc. What a waste of such a lovely room. And the drinks leave a lot to be desired. Pool and outside courtyard are lovely. Hotel is very clean. We did encounter some really rude loud guests who decided to continue their party in the hallway at 3 a.m. Easter Sunday. But guess you cannot do a background check of incoming guests."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Weekend in Charleston,"The Mills House is centrally located in the middle of everything we wanted to do during our stay. The staff members were the friendlist I have ever met. The rooms were great. The only down side was the pictures posted were true to the appearance of the hotel, but not the rooms. The rooms were a little more modern than pictured, this did not take away from our enjoyment though. We were on the 5th floor and had a great view. I would stay here again on another visit."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,Great Value,"Staff was awesome, location was great and it was a great value compared to other hotels in downtown Charleston. Parking is so bad in Charleston its worth staying somewhere on the peninsula so you don't have to try and find parking. Hotel offered very convenient valet service too."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,"Mills House, Charleston, SC","The Mills House is in a great location in the heart of Charleston's Historic District. There is a parking garage next door w/a walkway leading right to the Mills House. Once we parked the car, we had no need to move it - everything is w/i walking distance. There are several good restaurants also w/i walking distance of The Mills House.We are very pleased w/the accessibility of Hotels.com, the easy and prompt confirmation, and knowing there is someone at hand should we need them.Thank You!"
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Mills house hotel,"Our hotel room was very comfortably decorated and cozy, with everything we needed. The views were great and the bathroom well appointed. The hotel bar was very classically decorated and comfortable. W thoroughly enjoyed our stay!"
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,Hotel in prima Lage,"Da wir nur eine Nacht in Charleston bleiben konnten, war es uns wichtig m√∂glichst zentral im Herzen des ""Historic Charleston"" zu wohnen. Die Lage ist auch wirklich super. Auch sonst hatten wir nichts an dem Hotel auszusetzen, obwohl die Fotos vielleicht ein bisschen mehr vermuten lassen als tats√§chlich dahinter ist und auch das Wort ""Grand Hotel"" etwas hochgegriffen ist.Das Zimmer war gro√ü und sauber, dasBett bequem, das Personal freundlich und entgegenkommend, die Lage super."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Great Hotel,"My husband and I have been to Charleston multiple times and stayed at a lot of different places in the ""Historic Downtown"". This is out favorite! The staff is amazing! The valet guys actually went to my vehicle to pump up my little girls floaties (I have a tire/air pump to plug into my car). Then they delivered the floaties to the pool!The hotel was also clean and so convenient to everything!"
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,in center of historic Charleston,"everything was great - location, hotel lobby,  pool, The  only negative point was the awful coffee served at breakfast. Breakfast food in and off itself was fine. Loved being able to sit on the patio"
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,We had a great time!,The Mills is located with in walking distance of all of the historic district . My wife and I really enjoyed being able to walk to our dinner dates and see the sites all around us. Thanks do much!
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Nice stay,"We close on our house downtown, and needed a place to stay after the move. I really didn't have that much time at the hotel,because I was in late, and out early. My wife had more time, and really enjoyed it. I wish they served coffee before 6:30"

The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Awesome place to stay!,"Only stayed one night but would have loved to stay more. Great location, everything was within easy walking distance. Beautiful hotel and wonderfully nice and helpful staff. No complaints."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,"Comfortable, Clean and Close to many attractions","We really enjoyed our time at the Mills House. We were impressed when walking in and seeing the elegant chandeliers, marble flooring and elegant decor. The rooms were also decorated nicely and the bed comfortable. My only complaint would be that the walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors watching tv and talking. The location is great - close to many shops and restaurants and a quick walk down to Waterfront Park and other attractions."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Great place for couples.,Nice room overlooking the street and the river. Wonderful breakfasts as well.
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Best Western Portage,"We skiied at nearby Cascade Mountain and stayed at this inn. The breakfast included waffles, hard boiled eggs, muffins, bagels, cereal, apples and plenty of good coffee. The beds were fine with extra pillows, the room had a flat screen TV and was quiet. The pool was medium size and the hot tub was fine. Good hotel."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Great week in Charleston,"We loved the hotel and the staff. The concierges were especially helpful. It is in the best location for sightseeing and restaurants. One criticism - when I booked with your service, you told me a carriage ride and walking tour were included. The hotel staff said they never have included those extras. Hotels.com needs to straighten that out."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,Great Location,Loved the location. Within walking distance of all we wanted to do.
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,Lovely hotel in the heart of old town Charleston,The Mills House is just lovely. The rooms have upgraded bathrooms and wonderful bed linens. Very quiet. The dining room needs some attention when it comes to service and the food is up to the restaurant standards in the area but that is a small complaint.We would go back again.
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Beautiful Hotel,"We found the room very clean, the hotel staff was friendly, the breakfast in the restaurant was excellent. The hotel is in a great location and we were able to walk to many of the tourist attractions. The only thing I'd do different next time is self-park. We used the valet parking, which was wonderful, but we didn't need the car during our stay because everything was so close. We could have saved some money by using the parking deck located behind the hotel."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Historical Home and Garden Tours,Great location for city tours. Comfortable room. LOVE the courtyard for a nice drink after walking all day. Good breakfast buffet.
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,A wonderful Christmas,"My husband and I took my mother to Charleston for three days over Christmas. Mills House was beautifully decorated, perfectly located and staffed by the most helpful people! We were able to walk everywhere and were just across Queen from several fine restaurants. We will be back"
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,3,Charlston,"Compared to our stay in Washington DC and Savannah, both of which were historic buildings, the hotel did not meet our expectations. It was very expensive and although it was an historic hotel, room was dated and needed an update."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,Beautiful hotel!,"The hotel is beautiful, clean and in a great location. The bathrooms need to be larger but that is my only complaint."
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,4,Very Comfortable Hotel in a good area,We enjoyed our stay at the Mills House. It was in a great area and we could walk to everything. We chose this hotel because of the area and the pool. We had two kids who enjoyed the pool very much! The valets at this hotel were very helpful and accommodating!
The Mills House Wyndham Grand Hotel,5,Wonderful Stay,"We could not have had a better stay at the Mills House Hotel. Every detail was managed well. Because of our recent bookings at other hotels in this chain, we were automatically upgraded to their priority club. Great amenities came with the upgrade, which made our stay more enjoyable. The entire staff was friendly, courteous, and professional. The front desk and concierge made dinner suggestions and reservations for us both nights, with which we were very satisfied. We could not have stayed in a better hotel. We will stay there again if we return."
Hyatt Place Milford,4,Quality Experience,Only positives to take away from my stay as short as it was. Regular room was move like a mini-suite. Clean and spacious. Free breakfast was good. Small bar area prevented me from having to leave the hotel. Nice touch.
Hyatt Place Milford,5,Top o the Game,"Have stayed at quite a few of the Hyatt House/Place brand hotels. EAch has a nice sized room, divided up, make it very convenient if sleeping schedules are the same. Nice TV, everything was in the room as needed. A great stay!"
Hyatt Place Milford,5,Great room and staff,When I made this reservation I asked for a low floor because my daughter has a lot of sezuires and we needed to be able to get out quick if need be. The room was huge and very clean and the staff is very friendly. Will definatly be back. Thank you for acomidating us.
Hyatt Place Milford,5,Great place for a quick stop off the highway,"We were just there for one night en route from Ohio to Massachusetts, but the hospitality of the staff after 14 hours on the road was much appreciated. The room was exceptionally clean (I normally am skeeved out by even the moderately clean hotels and felt comfortable here) and there's a full bar and multiple types of actually GOOD food... More"
Hyatt Place Milford,5,5 years and counting,"I have been coming to this hotel for 5 years now. There are several other places in the area, but I come here.

She has sent me to several wonderful restaurants and helped me... More"

Best Western Plus Richmond Inn & Suites-Baton Rouge,3,BEST WESTERN,"I BOOKED THE HOTEL THRU HOTELS.COM. I ASKED FOR A ROOM WITH A BALCONY BUT NOT ON THE GROUND FLOOR. THAT DID NOT HAPPEN. THE MANAGER CALLED THE ROOM AND SAID THEY WOULD CHANGE US TO A 2ND FLOOR ROOM THE NEXT DAY. I ALSO NOTED THAT WE WERE IN TOWN FOR A FUNERAL, SO WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO CHANGE IN AND OUT OF ROOMS. WE WERE THERE FOR 2 NIGHTS. ON THE NEXT DAY OUR ROOM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CLEANED THERE WAS A NOTE LEFT FROM HOUSE KEEPING STATING THAT THEY DID NOT CHANGE THE BED BECAUSE WE LEFT LUGGAGE ON THE BED(THAT WAS NEW FOR ME. WE HAVE STAYED AT RESIDENCE INN AND THAT WAS NEVER AN ISSUE). THE WORSE PART WAS THAT THE HOUSEKEEPING STAFF LEFT THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPEN. WHEN WE ARRIVED BACK FROM THE FUNERAL LATE THAT EVENING THE DOOR WAS OPEN. WE DIDN'T KNOW IF SOMEONE WAS IN THE ROOM CLEANING OR IF IT WAS AN INTRUDER. MY HUSBAND JUST PUSHED IT OPEN AND THERE WAS NO ONE THERE, THE DOOR WAS JUST LEFT OPEN. NOT VERY RESPONSIBLE ON THEIR PART. I HAD SOME JEWELRY AND A LAPTOP IN THE ROOM."
Best Western Plus Richmond Inn & Suites-Baton Rouge,5,What an amazing Hotel!!! A+ in my book!!,"This is a really wonderful hotel! We booked two rooms for our stay. We were there at 3pm and we were able to check into only one of them because the other wasn't finished being cleaned. They were going to call us when the other room was ready. We waited around for about an hour and we finally went back in and asked. We reserved a room with a balcony- well, they didn't have one. Even after waiting for an hour, they didn't have a room for us. We stood up there waiting for about 30-45 more minutes, and they decided to give us a room with a kitchen, living room area and a fireplace in lieu of what we reserved. I have to say, they were very accommodating and we appreciated the extra space. They were very nice and did all they could to make it right- and we were very happy about our room when we finally got it!! Now, on to the free breakfast that is offered....it is amazing!!! Biscuits, white gravy, oatmeal(with all kinds of toppings to put in it!), bacon, grits, eggs, hash browns, cereal, toast, bagels(all types of cream cheese and butter and jellies), coffee, hot chocolate, apple juice, cranberry juice, orange juice and milk...there was sooooo much! This place is really kept up and clean!! We will definitely be staying here again! Thank you for such an awesome trip!!"
Best Western Plus Richmond Inn & Suites-Baton Rouge,5,Friendly and comfortable!,"All was wonderful, courteous staff, good choice of breakfast items, clean and quiet. Was surprised that the room thermostat would not respond to my setting, it was programmed to a pre-set temp which was a little too warm for my liking."
Best Western Plus Richmond Inn & Suites-Baton Rouge,1,1000 and a Soiled SOFA BED....Unprofessional and RUDE,The night front desk attendant Debbie was rude and unprofessional.

I awaited a call from the Front Desk Manager Gary Gillette all day on 2/29/16 he didn't call I had to call the hotel. He didn't care much... More
Best Western Plus Richmond Inn & Suites-Baton Rouge,4,Pretty good place to stay!,"Overall, a pretty good place to stay. The only bad thing I have to say about it is the mold that I found in/around the light box in the bathroom.

Best Western Plus Richmond Inn & Suites-Baton Rouge,3,Business trip,What I needed for a working trip
Best Western Plus Richmond Inn & Suites-Baton Rouge,5,Impressed with Best Western,"This hotel is the best we have stayed at in Baton Rouge -- Large rooms, very nice kitchen with granite and stainless appliances, clean bathroom with plenty of towels and toiletries, very comfortable bed with high quality bedding.

Everything was nice, including the landscaping. We were impressed."

Holiday Inn Express & Suites Carmel-north Indianapolis,5,Awesome!,"Sirea and Sylvia were awesome, both deserve a raise. Both totally went out of their way to help me with anything I needed.

Holiday Inn Express & Suites Carmel-north Indianapolis,5,nice place to stay,"other than the leak in the lobby hallway, it was great. breakfast was well done"
Holiday Inn Express & Suites Carmel-north Indianapolis,1,In no condition to accept guests!,"This place was horrible! They are being completely remodeled so there hasn't been any general maintanance for awhile you can tell. Also, none of the staff we encountered should even be working in the hotel/service industry, no clue about their job. No pool, only a couple floors even have rentable rooms, poor selection for breakfast, all starchy items not even any fruit, and no internet in the so called business center! They could at least have put a sign on the door. We were going to do our air check-in one morning and couldn't, if we had known the night before we could have planned something else. Really awful. We had several other family members there as well. Hotels.com shouldn't even have them on their list. The photos do not portray what it is now. Bottom line-DO NOT STAY HERE!"
Holiday Inn Express & Suites Carmel-north Indianapolis,4,Visiting family,Great value. The beds were very comfortable. Convenient to nearby shops.

Hampton Inn & Suites Dickinson,5,"Hampton Inn Suites Dickinson, ND","The Dickinson Hampton Inn Suites is the best Hampton hotel I have stayed in.

This hotel deserves your business if you are traveling to Dickinson ND."
Courtyard Scranton Wilkes-Barre,5,Nice remodel,I have not stayed here is a year but what a nice surprise! everything is new all of the rooms have been remodeled and are very comfortable. Service is always good and friendly. Food service and bar are nice and convenient.
Courtyard Scranton Wilkes-Barre,5,Very pleasant stay.,"The hotel was centrally located to where I needed to be. It is about 10-15 minutes from the Scranton Wilkes-Barre airport. The hotel entrance is a bit hidden from the main road. You must make a sharp turn then go up an incline before you see the main building and parking lot. Leaving, use caution as you must turn onto...

Courtyard Scranton Wilkes-Barre,1,Poor Customer Service,"Spoke with someone in the group reservations department about blocking rooms for a wedding was told I'd get a call back with answers to my questions by the end of the day! Up until that point, the person I spoke with was great.. Then thats where the greatness stopped... We're now 2+ weeks later with no call back, I've... More"
Courtyard Scranton Wilkes-Barre,5,Great Stay,The staff was very friendly and helpful. We arrived early and we're check-in with zero issues. The room was bigger than expected and clean. They even shuttled my friends and I around the area. We couldn't ask for a better stay.
Courtyard Scranton Wilkes-Barre,4,Good place to stay outside of Scranton,"Stayed for three nights for the FIRST Robotics FTC regional competition in March. Room was OK, with large flat TV, refrigerator and microwave. There was a coffee maker, but no coffee or creamers (I asked at the front desk and they sent some up, but it was never replaced after that). Bed was comfortable with a selection of pillows and... More"
Best Western Twin Islands,2,Not what I expected from the Best Western Brand,"We rarely were able to park near our room, and the one time we did another guest slammed their car door into our motorcycle. There was no real enforcement of any of the rules or common courtesies. The pool was only open until 1000 each night even though it is in a resort town were most activities run well into the evening. We were only able to use the pool once our entire stay. We used the laundry our last day there before our trip home and some of our clothes were stolen from the dryer. There was supposedly cameras there but we were told they could not access the video from them. Out of the entire 5 nights we were there the maid only serviced our room twice, but they were sure to leave a tip card in the room. If the service was exemplary we would have tipped them on our own. The balconies were covered with spiders. We told the front desk twice about it and their reply was to have the maid sweep it off. They then turned the lights off for the rest of our stay. Now we could not see the spiders on the chairs, the railings, and the doorways. Needless to say, no one used the balconies. Refridgerator in the room was not turned on, and when we did turn it on it was noisy and ineffective. The hotel itself looks like it needs updated badly. The beds were lumpy and the pillows uncomfortable. The walkway around the hotel along the water was dirty and in poor repair as well."
Best Western Twin Islands,5,EXCELLENT BEAUTIFUL SCENERY,"This was by far, the nicest property we have stayed at within the Gatlinburg/Pigeon Forge area. The scenery is beautiful with the river flowing all around the entire property. The atmosphere and ambiance is excellent. It is definitely within walking distance of all trollies just around the corner. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BEST WESTERN AND WE WILL STAY HERE EVERY... More"
Best Western Twin Islands,5,AWESOME,"This stay was one of the BEST stays i have ever had at a hotel. The scenery was very beautiful and sitting on the balcony was very relaxing and enjoyable. My daughter loved swimming in the pool, however i feel the hot tub could have been a little bit cleaner."
Best Western Twin Islands,5,Awesome place,"We had a 1 night stay this weekend on Honeymoon island with our 2 children. The hotel staff was super friendly, the room was clean, beds were super comfortable and the breakfast was great. We will come again. Would love to come during spring break!! :)"
Best Western Twin Islands,2,Would be great...,"Once you get into Gatlinburg you soon realize you'll be walking everywhere so location is key. This hotel has the perfect location to everything, huge plus. Upon checking in during our first stay, the front desk staff was not bad, not very welcoming though. Upon stay 2, 4 days later we were very appalled by the front desk staff. The... More"
Best Western Twin Islands,4,Very satisfied,"As a last minute option, we decided to stop in Gatlinburg for the night while traveling. We saw the proximity of the hotel to where we wanted to be and it was a perfect option. We registered quickly and were on the way to enjoy our evening without delay."
Best Western Twin Islands,5,Weekend,My wife and I stayed feb 13-14 for our 31st wedding anniversary. Had a very enjoyable stay. Close to everything. Rooms were very clean and the bed was comfortable.

Best Western Twin Islands,4,Just ducky,Very clean room and comfortable bed. Was disappointed that we did not have a river view room and/or a balcony.

No guests above or... More

Best Western Twin Islands,4,Great value and location,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Best Western Twin Islands. The room was comfortable and at a great location within Gatlinburg. I would have enjoyed more breakfast options like bagels or made already made oatmeal with additional add-ins.
Best Western Twin Islands,3,Good motel for the cost,It wasn't our first time at this motel. We like it because it is in a good centrally located spot and is reasonably priced. They have added a complimentary breakfast room since our last time there. The staff is nice. The facility for the most part is in good shape for its age. The only thing I didn't like was that the mattresses are too soft for my back. When we return to Gatlinburg again we will try to stay there again and hope for a new firmer mattress.
Best Western Twin Islands,5,Great,"This hotel was wonderful. The views were amazing and everyone was so nice. We even had one of the maintenance men stop traffic to let us out of the parking lot (Gatlinburg traffic is not fun). This hotel was a great location to everything.

Best Western Twin Islands,3,Trip to Gatlinburg,A little pricey for very average accommodations. House cleaning out in front of our door - very noisy - there for hours. Otherwise a decent place to stay. Very tight parking. Nice picnic table in back of motel.

Best Western Twin Islands,4,Quirky Gatlinburg,"The hotel is old, which makes it quirky. But was in a great location at the end of the strip which made it quite."
Best Western Twin Islands,4,Overall decent stay,My girlfriend and I liked our room. It was very clean and perfect size for just the two of us. The only thing we were disappointed about was the location of the room itself. We booked the room thinking that it had a view of the creek. We were really wanting to see and hear it from our room. The title of creek side was very misleading. One other issue we had was that we weren't given the information to use the wifi.

Best Western Twin Islands,5,Humble old motel in great location,"Came up quickly upon the alternate entrance on the road from Pigeon Forge. It is an old but decent property.

Someone turned off the fridge... More"
Best Western Twin Islands,2,disappointing,The location and view were very impressive with very large pool and playground. The stream flowing around the facility was spectacular. The staff was very friendly. The rooms were very run down and gloomy. Our sink stopper was broke which was taken care of right away but carpet was very nasty. For what I paid I expected much more.
Best Western Twin Islands,4,"Clean, Quiet and in a Great Location","The best part of this hotel is the location. It's within walking distance of everything. The breakfast was severely lacking and crowded, but we'd rather go out and eat at the local places anyway. The hotel is right on the river, which is gorgeous. Bring extra bread to feed the ducks!

Morongo Casino Resort & Spa,4,Nice large quiet room,The hotel was nice. Beds were very comfy! Elevators wre fast. My only negative would be the smoke in the casino was pretty bad. And there was not a no smoking area which I found odd.
Aloft Detroit at The David Whitney,4,Great for Business or Pleasure,"The lower floors of this beautiful office building have been re-purposed as the Aloft Detroit.

Fairfield Inn & Suites Indianapolis Downtown,5,Great Hotel,Stayed for conference at the JW Marriott. It was a great location and easily within walking distance to my conference.

Fairfield Inn & Suites Indianapolis Downtown,4,Good Visit,"My stay here was very nice, the staff were nice, the hotel was in great condition and had great views to downtown. Very reasonable pricing also. My only complaint is that we did not know ahead of time that all rooms do not have a refrigerator. I was informed that only the executive king suites have refrigerators. Lucky enough for us we brought along an icebox and was able to keep everything cold. All in all I would recommend this hotel!"
Fairfield Inn & Suites Indianapolis Downtown,5,Great Hotel in a Great Location with Great Service,"We stayed in Room 426. The check-in was easy and fast.

Fairfield Inn & Suites Indianapolis Downtown,4,Grat location,Great location. There was a lot of things going on downtown and the only complaint was parking lot was full and had to use the valet.
Fairfield Inn & Suites Indianapolis Downtown,5,Beyond expectations!,"We had a wonderful time. We planned this stay as a Christmas gift to our children, 7 and 8 yr olds tk watch their first Colts game.I was so happy to not have to walk outside to get to the stadium s ok we didn't have to pack their winter coats all day. We had dinner right down stairs at TGI Fridays and walked to the mall the night before.parking was easy and worth the money to know that my car was ok until after the game. We will definitely be staying again for games and just family time."
Fairfield Inn & Suites Indianapolis Downtown,2,Don't stay here if there is a stadium event.,"When there is a Colts game, parking commitments to guests are abandoned in favor of game day parking. The debacle caused us to miss a planned event. Had to check out early because the valets could not promise to bring my car on time, even though I gave them an hour's notice. 25 daily parking fee should ensure better service."

Best Western Wapakoneta Inn,5,One of the Top Best Westerns,"I have stayed a number of Best Westerns over the last 30 years in Canada the USA and this one at Wapakoneta, OHIO rates right up there with the best of them.

Rodeway Inn Suites Downtowner-Rte 66,5,High Desert Jewel,A frequent stop for us. Difficult to keep the temperature constant. Older but wellmaintained motel. Beds were comfortable and clean. Small rooms so stay with people you like. Quiet even with a train running through town.
Rodeway Inn Suites Downtowner-Rte 66,4,Good location.,"Good, quiet location. Away from the shops but still in the heart of it all. Within walking distance of everything including Grand Canyon railway. The usual noise from neighbors -- running water, doors closing and mumbled voices through the walls. I'd stay here again."
Rodeway Inn Suites Downtowner-Rte 66,3,Perfect!,"Loved this little town! The hotel was very comfortable and quiet. Older hotel but nicely refurbished with funky decor and good quality furniture and bedding. Staff was very friendly, efficient and helpful.

Ramada Oklahoma City Near Bricktown,2,not what we expected,"The hotel is listed as near Bricktown. I guess that would depend on your definition of near. Near to me would be near the Pilot truckstop as it was next door. Our room was clean, but you could walk to the pool an see other rooms that were not. Many had mattresses propped up against the wall, and almost all the second floor rooms had pillows stuffed in the a/c units. You could see all this through the windows of the parking lot because lots of the sliding glass door curtains were open or missing pieces. It honestly looked like they were fixing it one room at a time. I don't know how old the hotel is, but it is far from being completely renovated. I think hotels.com should do more research on the hotels they show with a 4 star rating. The two star the hotel showed was more accurate."
Ramada Oklahoma City Near Bricktown,5,"Great staff, good price","We arrived at the Bricktown Hotel but they had no record of our booking which was made through bookings.com.

Ramada Oklahoma City Near Bricktown,4,Exceeded expectations,"Rooms greatly exceeded expectations. Nice and clean.

Ramada Oklahoma City Near Bricktown,2,3 Stars should be much better than this..,"Very disappointed...this is a 3 star It is a 40+ year old hotel they are trying to bring up to date. I commend them for trying to make improvements, but the workmanship was very shoddy and unprofessional. The tile in the bathroom was only 1/2 grouted. The shower faucet was hanging by a screw coming out of the wall. Dried paint was all over the bathroom floor where they painted the walls after laying the tile--without covering it--or cleaning up after. Ceiling texture was all over the light fixtures and mirrors. Lighting in hallways was dark and scary."

When we arrived, three 20-something workers were behind the desk, but their customer service orientation was fairly low. I needed to ask questions to get any information about the stay.

Silverstone Inn & Suites,4,Surprisingly nice with better than most breakfast.,"Very nice place, the room zone heating and cooling was either to hot or when OFF to cold with the outside temp at 30, the room cooled down pretty quick and got cold. This place is a very good value at 50 per night compared with what is in the area. YES, Id stay here again in a heart beat."
Silverstone Inn & Suites,4,Good overall experience,Great room and nice to have complimentary breakfast and coffee/tea most of the day. Facilities were clean and well maintained. It is located in a nice quiet area of Post Falls but is somewhat removed from most of the dining and activities. It's only a short drive away so only a minor inconvenience. Overall it was a great stay and we would not hesitate to stay again!
Silverstone Inn & Suites,3,"Nice, but not baby friendly",We booked our room through expedia and it lists cribs as available. When we checked in however we were told they don't have cribs. Super disappointing when traveling with a 1 year old.

Silverstone Inn & Suites,2,The dark rooms and ancient furnishings were a turnoff.,"This seems like a great value when compared with other area hotels, but it's worth the extra drive to Spokane Valley or Coeur d'alene.

Silverstone Inn & Suites,5,A Great Stay-,"Stayed 3 Nights. Hotel Ruby of Ponderay has a great appearance. There are many wide parking spots. It is nicely kept with a very open and modern looking lobby that includes a common area TV and dinning facility. The Staff is friendly and kind. Breakfast, though basic was good and satisfying with the bonus of a waffle maker (Which I always like). The room was very clean and the bed was soft and comfortable. Temperature control worked great. The room was not as spacious as other hotels rooms can be, but there is also no wasted space. Wifi worked very well and has several routers depending on what section of the hotel you are in. The pool and sauna were nice too. And did I mention the price. Best deal in town price wise. If I ever return to Ponderay, this Hotel would be my first choice."

And, the breakfast is always a plus, especially when you have kids. You can sit down and enjoy yourself, then go to destinations."
Hampton Inn Hilton Head,3,Slightly disappointed,This was our first stay at this hotel though we generally stay at a Hampton Inn when travelling. This was by far the worst condition we've ever found a Hampton in. I believe a renovation and upgrade throughout the hotel would benefit this location greatly.
Hampton Inn Hilton Head,4,Family Vacation,Stay was overall wonderful. Bathrooms could use a little maintenance. We would stay here again. This was an affordable convenient option when you cannot afford to stay waterfront.

We enjoyed our stay."
Hampton Inn Hilton Head,5,Great Choice!,"Centrally located hotel on Hilton Head. This is a lovely, safe facility for the single female traveler. If only they offered small bottles of wine in their snack purchase area (other Hampton Inns have the license), I would say this was perfection :)"

Hampton Inn Indianapolis/carmel,5,Great hotel,"This Hampton Inn is located within 5 minutes of the freeway, but has very little traffic noise.

Suburban Extended Stay Hotel,5,Awesome ;),Room and hotel was better than expected and employees could have not been more friendly!!!
Suburban Extended Stay Hotel,5,Great value,"Pleasantly surprised. Decently priced, clean, and super friendly staff.

I mentioned it to the front desk on check out and they seemed surprised even though many comments state the same thing."
Norfolk Country Inn & Suites,2,Not Again,Hotel is dated and needs updating. Free continental breakfast was a disappointment. Will not stay here again.
Norfolk Country Inn & Suites,2,Don't expect a good nights sleep.,"A lot of noise street noise, very loud in the room. The bed was horrible. We only got a few hours sleep. The room was clean enough but not great. The staff was okay but the room was a disappointment."
Norfolk Country Inn & Suites,3,Good -0 but not best place,We were here three nights. there were some kids playing with fire bombs the first coupe nights and there were some smokers right above us that kept throwing their butts over the railing and one night there was a car in the handicapped place right outside our door. The gardener kept trying to keep the butts picked up and did a pretty good job of it!
Norfolk Country Inn & Suites,1,Very disappointed,"We were very disappointed in this hotel. The cable was out our entire stay, the pool was not filled (in july) and the bar/restaurant was closed. We wernt told about any of this. Was not worth the amount we paid. Very disappointed!"
Norfolk Country Inn & Suites,5,Will stay here again,"The hotel is fully functional. I like the fact there are no hallways, as you enter the rooms from the outside. Parking is plentiful. The pool wasn't filled and that was a bummer. The lady at the desk upon check in was pretty snippy. The gal working the desk the next morning was awesome. The restaurant, Bailey's, was worth the stay alone. The food was amazing. The room wasn't perfect. But there were plenty of channels to watch, and the soft water was nice. The bed was big and comfy. There were a couple parts of the room that weren't the cleanest and the exhaust fan in the bathroom didn't work. All in all I stand behind this place being a good choice if you're looking to stay in Norfolk. Don't give the Hampton all your money. Stay here instead."
Norfolk Country Inn & Suites,4,Clean Hotel,Looks old from the outside but not bad on the inside. The breakfast and breakfast area was good. Baily's the restaurant was nice looking but understaffed at the time. The night shift lady messed up our room reservation but was quick to correct the mistake. The afternoon ladies were unpleasant and not quick to help. Not a bad stay if you don't need much help from the front desk.

Hampton Inn Kingsland,5,Very Comfortable Accommodations,"Our total experience was excellent. The staff was very friendly, the beds were soft and cozy, and the room was very clean and quiet.

Hampton Inn Kingsland,2,Cheap and unresponsive,"I'm a Hilton Gold member and was told on check in I could have a bottle of water each day during a busy two week stay.

Overall the stay was great. Would do it again just to get away for a couple days."

Super 8 Augusta,1,Free Lyme Disease!!,"I gave this a 'this room is great for free wifi and sightseeing' review because there wasn't an option for absolutely nothing. We did have wifi, and we got to see a few drug deals in the parking lot, so that could qualify as sightseeing. The room itself was acceptable, the beds were clean, however, they should rethink their free pet policy as our room had ticks, and so we left, after being there two hours. The pictures on hotels.com are NOT pictures of this hotel. The staff was amazing...refunded our money, very apologetic, absolutely outstanding customer service."

Aqua Waikiki Pearl,5,Best service,Best service all round For the price you pay the rooms are clean and spacious. Facilities could be improved within apartments but nothing that was un comfortable. The receptionist were helpful and friendly. Would recommend to anyone
Aqua Waikiki Pearl,3,Great location in heart of Waikiki!,"Too much construction all around Jan. 2016--the street, two hotel buildings behind and adjacent made it very noisy!!

Super 8 Port Royal/beaufort,3,"Needs updated, staff were very nice.OK for a night","The hotel is a bit shabby and needs updating. Outdoor pool was decent, but the pool furniture was falling apart, and there was very little of it. On the sides of the pool, was a ton of trash, garbage, debris, and an old mattress propped up behind the dumpster. They really should see these things and clean it up. The room was like a small suite, with a new flat screen. The couch however was filthy. The couches in the rooms that I saw when doors were open, all need cleaned big time. Bed was OK, comfortable enough. I asked for an unstained comforter when I got there extra pillows, and my requests were pleasantly handled right away. I must say, the staff were all very nice. Maids forgot to replenish the coffee in the room, and I had to go for it 3 times. But they were always nice and brought anything we needed. It would never be my first choice in Beaufort, but not my last, either. They just need to pay attention to DEEPER cleaning and updating. Well-intentioned OK for a night or two."
Super 8 Port Royal/beaufort,2,It is what it is.,"The facility was not bad for the price the room was clean, beds were good and everything worked. The people that stay there however were unpleasant to be around.On day1my girlfriend could not walk out of her room without getting harassed by a gentlemen with his pants on the ground so she had to be escorted every time she left the room. The same group partied till 5a.m. and our room wreaked of the weed smoke from the room next door. Day 2 there were several ferral children running around some naked all unattended while parents chain smoked Pall Malls on the steps. Again the facility was nice ,it was clean and was not bad except for the other guests."
Red Roof Inn Hardeeville,1,Will never stay in a RED Roof Inn again,"Absolutely the worse motel/hotel we had ever stayed in. No elevator. Steep unkept stairs. First impression upon entering, was very poor. Walls dirty, light switches dirty, dirty torn lampshades with mold in neighboring room. Sheets appeared clean. Bathroom the worse. Bathmat appeared dirty, when lifted it was mold from the underside. Floor, wall, corners, ceiling all needed cleaned and renewed.... More"
Red Roof Inn Hardeeville,4,We were surprised,"We were very surprised at how the place had been updated. The service was very efficient and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable - the bed itself could have been better, but then the rates would probably been higher. The neighborhood was not the best and there were very few places to eat or pick up needed food or sundries. They are a pet friendly chain, which we liked if we choose to travel with our in the future. All in all, we liked the Red Roof and found it to be better than we expected."
Red Roof Inn Hardeeville,3,Stopover to Florida,nice quiet comfortable room
Red Roof Inn Hardeeville,2,Not clean,"Room and bathroom smelled like urine. Breakfast area was dirty, and food was handled with bare hands by attendant instead of using utensils. Overall hotel is severely run down, and in dire need of renovations and updates. At least the sheets were clean and the staff was friendly."
Red Roof Inn Hardeeville,4,Good experience,"Arrived late. Room was clean, very nice linens, good Wi-Fi connection. Left early the next day and six hours later, discovered I left a vest there. I called the hotel and spoke to Nash. He contacted housekeeping and found it. Shipped it out to my next destination. Excellent service!"
Red Roof Inn Hardeeville,2,A bit scary at night.,"Stayed here for one night. Saw suspicious people hanging out in the parking lot by the pool area. We arrived late at night. They were dressed with baggy clothes with pants hanging down their bottom. A car picked them up, then dropped them off minutes later. As I peaked out the window, I saw that this went on all night....

Red Roof Inn Hardeeville,2,Property Needs cleaning and maintenance,"Front desk reception staff very welcoming. Lobby comfortable and inviting . Room was dark and damp . Bathroom had mold in corners, needs a good scrubbing with bleach. Laminate floor needs cleaning, it was scuff marked and had nail polish drops on it. Breakfast bad, dried out biscuits ,no jam or peanut butter for toast, no yogurt."
Red Roof Inn Hardeeville,4,Best spot on the way south,"We have stayed at this Red Roof Inn a half a dozen times or more because it is convenient, clean, and comfortable. The staff is friendly and they are pet friendly. The breakfast is what you get everywhere else...quick and enough to get you on the road quickly."
Red Roof Inn Hardeeville,5,Great price and great place to stay,"For the location, right outside of Savannah, the price can't be beat. The staff is very polite and accommodating, the motel is always busy with travelers, so you can assume it's a decent place to stay. The breakfast the following morning is better than most, they actually have pretty decent food. I enjoy staying here, and will come back"
Days Inn-jfk Airport,4,great for airport access,"Clean and well maintained, convenient to the airport, a half mile walk to any stores, staff friendly. Would stay again for airport access but it's definitely not quiet with all the highway noise."
Days Inn-jfk Airport,3,Staff was friendly and helpful but hotel wasn't much,"The front desk staff was very helpful, called a cab and helped with questions. The shuttle to/from the airport was good. The hotel was very cramped in all ways including the rooms. Had to pay for just about everything including printing and even coffee. Walls were thin. Location was pretty ugly, looking out on a yard full of parked buses.... More"

Holiday Inn Express Marietta - Atlanta Northwest,4,Christmas Eve overnight,The hotel was nice but unfortunately something was wrong with our air. We turned it in at checkin around 6 and was hoping by bedtime it would be better. We just decided to suck it up so we could try to get some rest in hopes of waking up cooler
Holiday Inn Express Marietta - Atlanta Northwest,1,Room billed and no room available,"Expedia charged me for the room, but Hotel did not honor the reservation. HJotel sent me to expedia and expedia to hotel TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE with Expedia"
Holiday Inn Express Marietta - Atlanta Northwest,2,Disappointed 2nd visit did not match prior visit,The rooms had 2 double beds instead of 2 queen beds and there were no available cribs or cots for our room. The TV in our room did not work. Other guests were quite loud into the night.
Days Inn Suites Big Spring,5,Visited Family,"Newly remodeled, very clean, and wait staff was the best. I will diffently stay again. Highly recommended. Traveled to Big Spring to visit family and attend the Fantastic Forth to see Ronnie Millsap, Great White and Quit Riot. Great place great show."
Days Inn Suites Big Spring,5,Clean and well maintained,"I was pretty impressed with how clean the hotel was. It seemed to have recently been remodeled, and it made my stay quite pleasant."
Extended Stay America Fort Worth - Southwest,1,DON'T EVER STAY HERE.,"I don't normally write bad reviews unless I was extremely unhappy with the experience hence this rating. This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The previous guest had left the toilet clogged and the hotel never bothered to unclog and clean it. When we arrived at the room and notified the front desk, the maintenance guy blamed it... More"
Extended Stay America Fort Worth - Southwest,4,We were pleased!,"If I wanted to be nitpicky, there might be some stuff to improve. But I am not and we were very pleased with our room, especially for the Priceline special price we paid. It was large and roomy and great for me and 2 energetic older kids. We had many tv channels to choose from, including 2 Showtime channels. I... More"
Hampton Inn Houston Deer Park Ship Area,4,Deer Park Hamption,"Good experience with one exception. Room 123 is not good due to close proximity to exercise room, and should perhaps be considered as not a guest room. Each morning as people would exercise, perhaps at 5am, I awoke and could not return to sleep because the running on the machine was very loud."
Hampton Inn Houston Deer Park Ship Area,3,Hampton Deer Park,"Decently clean room, but beware if you have allergies. Hotels should offer an alternative to goose down pillows. Hypoallergenic pillows would have been nice instead of having to buy my own. Also, a/c unit in room was quite loud."
Hampton Inn Houston Deer Park Ship Area,1,Nothing went well,Power went out at only this property for several hours. Staff was not equipped to deal with it. Breakfast in the morning the worst ever at a Hampton Inn. Total cut corners property. Will not stay again
Sound Board,5,fantastic,"We came for one night to go to a Lions game, the staff were great and very friendly, the rooms were spacious, renovated and amazing.

Sound Board,4,Good for a few hours of fun,Stopped in at this casino on the way back from Birchrun MI shopping. Not to fond of trying to find our way in and the area. But all went well. Found the money wen quick so the visit was not long. Did not hear a lot of winners going off. Could of been just the Sunday we were there.
Sound Board,5,Nice room,"I liked the big, clean room. The deep tub was a plus. Friendly staff, check in was fast. The bed was comfortable. There were plenty of pillows and towels. The room was quiet even though there were people in the nearby rooms."
Sound Board,5,A great stay in Detroit,"We had a great visit to MotorCity casino and Detroit in general. We were in town to see the Tigers and White Sox play, and the hotel shuttled us all around Detroit so that we didn't have to get in our car at all. They let us check in 3 hours early, the staff was super friendly and accommodating, and... More"
Flamingo Suites,1,Absolute Nightmare!,"This place is the worst ever!! First of all, we had to pay for our entire stay up front (before we saw the room). Then when we got to the room, it reeked of cigarettes and had cigarette burns on everything. There were roaches coming in under the door and smashed bugs on the wall! There was no hot water... More"
Redwood Motel,4,"Good, clean motel for the price","We stayed at the Redwood when we were looking for a reasonably priced motel for the SuperBowl weekend. (It is quite a ways from the Super Bowl site.) Considering the price, the Redwood was a good motel and was very clean. It's older, but managment seems to be working hard to maintain a reasonble place to stay."
Motel 6 Scottsdale,4,The Perfect Spring Training Hotel for those on a Budget,"It's not a 5-star hotel. It's a Motel 6. But it's a Motel 6 right in the heart of Scottsdale, next to the mall, breakfast places, bars, restaurants and clubs with an easy walk anywhere on Scottsdale Road all the way to the ballpark. You know it's a Motel 6 going in. You will get what Tom Bodett says, A... More"
Northwoods Resort,4,Very Relaxing,"Loved the fireplace and full kitchen. WiFi could have been better. Loved the view from the living room. I will come back for special occasions in the future. Very cozy, but bedroom was not heated. We had to leave the bedroom door open and leave the gas fireplace on to heat the bedroom, but it still was a little cool."
Best Western Grandma's Feather Bed,5,great BB,"This is the second time staying here with my wife. Just like before, it was a great time. the rooms have plenty of space, the are clean and comfy, and carry the Victorian era theme in them. The whirpool bath tub is always a nice touch.

Hampton Inn Oxford-West,4,Excellent staff,"We stayed three nights here recently and found the accommodations satisfactory. Clean room, quiet, everything worked well.

Hampton Inn Oxford-West,4,Good hotel,"While generally speaking I believe that most next-tier hotels are overpriced, I have been satisfied with this Hampton. The staff is kind and caring for a college town, where mostly I see college-age kids running the desks. The ones at this location, for the most part, seem interested in parent-age people, and they respect that business travel isn't the same... More"
Best Western Manhattan Inn,4,Manhattan Best Western,"This is the 2nd time we stayed at this motel, we travel for Craft Shows. Like the fact that you park off to the side and are on a service road.

Best Western Manhattan Inn,2,Clueless Employees,"What major chain has only one employee on staff at 3:00 on a Friday afternoon While the gal at check in was very friendly she was clueless.

Quality Inn,3,Nice property but the breakfast was poor,This is a nice looking property so we decided to stay here. The staff was friendly at check-in. I got an AARP discount after asking for it. They were also pet friendly and allowed our small dog to stay for only 15. The rooms were comfortable and quiet. Everything worked and was clean. Check-out was pleasant. They gave us coupons... More
Quality Inn,3,"Nothing fancy, but a good night's sleep","While traveling with 3 small kids, we booked this room for a quick stopover on a drive from Colorado to Iowa.

Quality Inn,2,Crazy over priced!,"This is an old style motel with external doors that has had the rooms redone.

Hampton Inn Suites Kansas City-Country Club Plaza,5,Great review,"Jenell and Micheal and the overnight guy we re extremely welcoming and informative.

Hampton Inn Suites Kansas City-Country Club Plaza,5,Clean and well staffed,easy check in with staff that was responsive with suggestions to my restaurant questions making a great recommendation.

Hampton Inn Suites Kansas City-Country Club Plaza,4,Good option,"We came for the weekend. The room was clean and the beds comfortable enough.

Hampton Inn Suites Kansas City-Country Club Plaza,3,Not the typical Hampton Inn experience.,"Hampton Inns are my first choice wherever we go. I've reviewed other locations very favorably but this is the first time I have a slightly negative experience. The walls are VERY thin.

Hampton Inn Suites Kansas City-Country Club Plaza,4,Convenient and comfortable,"This was a good choice. It was on the edge of the plaza so we were able to walk. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was immaculate and well appointed. Though we only took advantage of the complimentary breakfast one morning, it was very good. We will use this hotel again when we go back this spring."
Comfort Suites Kansas City-Liberty,4,Good,The room had trash in the trash can and there was quite a bit of debris along the edge of the walls. Bed was comfortable.
Alicia's Eagle Rock Lodge,3,"Room was fine, but VERY small...","The room was fine, but was very small. You could not walk around the room with a suitcase on the floor. The bags had to be on the bed to walk around and on the floor to sleep. I think the room was approximately 14 X 14 with 2 beds. Decorating and cleanliness were fine, just small."
Sleep Inn,5,"Clean and friendly, nice place to stay",Easy to get to. Room was clean and the staff was friendly. About the only Hiccups were a malfunctioning fire alarm that was silenced after a few seconds and some inconsiderate guest slamming their door. Can't blame the Inn for that. Breakfast is provided in the morning and the area is kept well maintained by staff. Room has a wall... More

Quality Inn Suites,2,Ants,"The staff was very friendly and nice, the bed was comfortable, but there were ants on the walls, in the bathroom - we kept our suitcases zipped to make sure we didn't take any with us! Fortunately the bed was clean and ant-free. The room was clean - they just had a problem with ants which should have been taken care of. The front desk guy, a very friendly young man, did tell s when we left that the were doing complete renovations in the next few months, so this problem might soon be solved."
Quality Inn Suites,2,Flee infested!,"The room looked clean from first impression, but there were flees everywhere. Our room was supposed to be no let's allowed. If no pets are allowed there should not have been flees. We only stayed one night, but by the time we left, my husband and I both had flee bites all over our legs."
Rodeway Inn,1,Dump,"Do not stay here. Filthy. Sleep in your car if you need an alternative. The board of health should close this hotel down. The manager was rude, the rooms were filthy, smelled like smoke. Would not even sleep under covers."

Travelodge Cortez,3,"Good enough, good sleep","The bed was good in room 110. The bathroom was massive without shelving, and thus there was no place to set things. Outlets were in short supply. Room was spacious and clean. Overall for the price it was good. But seriously put some shelves in the bathroom for my wife. And have a wheat free breakfast option."
Comfort Inn,1,Disappointing to say the least,"The Pros... Cheap, clean, quiet The Cons... We were supposed to be in adjoining rooms with the rest of our family for a graduation trip/celebration.

Best Western Pioneer Inn,5,Best Mai Tai on the island of Maui.,I have been all over the island and no one does a better Mai tai. I stopped at a exclusive resort restaurant that charged 16.00 for thier Mai tai's and they were a little weak. They have great happy hour prices and maintain a tasty Mai tai with a punch.
Best Western Pioneer Inn,5,Great time,"For basic accommodations, this place is perfect. Right in the center of town, welcoming staff, clean room, couldn't ask for more. With a restaurant on-premises, it was perfect for breakfast and great for sunset in the afternoon."

Best Western Pioneer Inn,4,Great Down town Location,"Located right in the heart of historic Lahaina, you can't get a more convenient hotel for the price.

Best Western Pioneer Inn,4,Historic and quirky with the best location,Don't expect a resort property like so many on this beautiful island.

Best Western Pioneer Inn,4,Great location,"This is a old hotel so the rooms are a little crowded but it all seems to fit.

Best Western Pioneer Inn,4,Pioneer Inn has Character.,What a lovely old hotel with so much character. The rooms are small but the Lanai's are really big.

Yes the air conditioners are noisy but we were so tired from... More
Best Western Pioneer Inn,4,Super Convenient,"I would highly recommend this hotel for its convenience to the Lahaina wharf.

Best Western Ramkota Hotel,4,Great Stay,We enjoyed our stay. The bed was very comfortable. Staff very pleasant!
Best Western Ramkota Hotel,4,Good for one night,"We stayed for one night while attending a wedding. Cons: The AC in the room had to be set to 62* from the air to work at all. Even set at 62*, the room felt 70-72*. The bathroom is very dated. The shower/tub didn't work properly. And there is no light specifically for the shower room. There is one switch that controls both the vanity and the shower. No continental breakfast. You're only option is (overpriced) Minerva's. Pros: Very nice staff. The rooms are very clean. It's near Thunder Road."
Best Western Ramkota Hotel,5,Overnight stay with friends,"We enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Although the pool hours didn't accommodate our after 10 P.M. arrival, the bartender still served us the length of time we needed to relax after our long journey. Rooms were great, although we wished for an exhaust fan in the bath. 3 people needing showers in the morning necessitated this feature. Overall, we were pleased with our experience."
Best Western Ramkota Hotel,3,nice... a couple of problems,"The hotel was nice. The hallways were nasty though. The floor looked like they hadn't been vacuumed in months. The pool room was freezing. Couldn't take our 18 month swimming for very long. The hot tub stopped working our second day there. Was the same temperature as the pool. Otherwise, very nice, spacious hotel. Friendly staff. Just a couple of things to work on."
Best Western Ramkota Hotel,3,It was just okay,"In town for a funeral. The hotel was okay. Heat/AC was noisy. Wires across floor in common area a trip hazard. Employees were pleasant. The room was a little suite, but was oddly set up. Some of the furniture was too big for the room, almost totally blocking the small closet. But overall no major complaints."
Primrose Motel,5,Excellent !!!!,"I was there with a little worry. Buy I enjoyed so much . It has been remodeled and find no problem . With new management and outstanding quality control, I enjoyed so much. Free WiFi and cable TV, Etc.... moderated rate,, Perfect !!! Good experience...."
Ramada Mesa Phoenix East Area,5,Highly Recommend,"Loved this hotel so much we decided to stay an extra night. Customer service was on point, and the area was quiet regardless of how many family's were there."
Ramada Mesa Phoenix East Area,4,Convenient and good hotel,Nice comfortable place to stay. Enjoyed the pool. Breakfast was ok just needed something else instead of just eggs. Cereals and waffles were good.
Ramada Mesa Phoenix East Area,2,Less than average,"3 stars is a bit over what I would call this hotel. The rooms are old and the walls are thin. Hopefully you can find a silent corner of the hotel because if you neighbors or anyone outside is talking in a regular voice, it sounds like they're in the room. Parking and location is convenient. Nice waterway next door to walk around. With the availability in the area, I would look at other options"

Ramada Mesa Phoenix East Area,1,Horrible customer service!!,"The individual by the name of John who worked the front desk was very rude on May 17, 2016.I would never recommend or stay at this hotel.

Ramada Mesa Phoenix East Area,2,So old and the smell was horrible,I went into the dark room and the lights did nothing to brighten it up. Also when I drove up I thought the place was deserted and shut down. I turned around and left...even though I was losing over 100.
Hilton Garden Inn Wichita,4,"Hilton Garden Inn, Wichita","Great staff, nice facilities, clean rooms, great service and good breakfast.

Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites Defiance,3,The hotel did what was needed,"The Holiday Inn Express is on the north side of town in an area with other hotels, some restaurants and some box stores. The receptionist was friendly, the room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Rooms have fridges, irons and TVs with a good selection of channels. Breakfast is included in the price. The bedroom was attractively furnished. The bathroom was a bit dowdy. But the hotel did what was needed - provide a safe and comfortable place to spend the night while on the road."

Fairfield Inn & Suites Louisville Downtown,4,Visiting Louisville Slugger,"Hotel was great, easy to find and close to Louisville Slugger. The only thing I didn't like about this hotel was the parking. The parking garage is on the other side of another hotel."
Fairfield Inn & Suites Louisville Downtown,4,Great for a quick stay,Great service and ease in location - it didn't seem walkable to restaurants though but it was easy enough to drive. Good breakfast bar!
Fairfield Inn & Suites Louisville Downtown,5,Perfect Location. Friendly Staff. Ideal Room.,"Went for Thunder Over Louisville 2015. VERY polite and friendly staff and desk crew. Ice makers were broken on 2nd and 3rd floors, but there were personnel on site actively working the problem, so it wasn't so bad. Perfect location in the heart of Downtown Louisville. Would certainly stay again next year!"

Fairfield Inn & Suites Louisville Downtown,5,Nice Hotel,"The hotel was excellent and the staff were great!

The room had a small refrigerator which was a nice surprise, and the gym was surprisingly well-stocked with equipment."
Fairfield Inn & Suites Louisville Downtown,1,Horrible!,I called the manager Matt for two straight weeks and left multiple messages. He felt it was unnecessary to return any of phone calls so my stay was ruined. I would never stay here again.
Fairfield Inn & Suites Louisville Downtown,2,"Bad area, wouldn't go back",Went down for breakfast and there was none left. What they did have was terrible. Comforter on bed was dirty.

TownePlace Suites Omaha West,5,Really Liked It,"We used 10,000 Marriott points for our stay in room 117. It was roomy, and had a massive closet.

TownePlace Suites Omaha West,5,Everything is Good Here,From the front desk to the room and next day breakfast this place is first class. It is crowded due to being the homebase of Cox Cable employees - so book ahead! Just off 680 on the west side - you can get to anywhere in Omaha from here quick.
TownePlace Suites Omaha West,4,"Great location, quiet.","Stayed two nights here while attending a sporting event at Centurylink Center.

Hampton Baltimore/White Marsh,2,Not what I paid for or expected.,"Well first off, I paid for a King with a sofa bed Non-smoking. When I arrived and checked in, once in the room I discovered I had been given a full size bed. I immediately called down to the front-desk and the manager said she was all out of Non-smoking King rooms and that she didn't know why Hotels.com booked me and charged me for that room. I told her I had paid for it already and was told that I would have to take it up with Hotels.com. I was extremely upset and she offered me a Smoking King room. I wasn't comfortable with that but because my two small boys wanted to stay in the hotel (just for the pool) I agreed to the king room smoking. We all have allergies so I was a bit uncomfortable staying there but did it to please my boys."
Hampton Baltimore/White Marsh,5,Positive experience.,Wonderful woman at front desk and man working as general maintenance.
Hampton Baltimore/White Marsh,4,"Good hotel, worth the price.","Nice clean hotel. Check in friendly and easy. Rooms very nice, clean and well appointed.

Free breakfast really nice with eggs, sausage and cook your own waffles!"

Americas Best Value Inn Suites Carrollton,3,Utilitarian choice,"So you're on the road and reach Carrollton in early evening.

Fairfield Inn Saginaw,5,great stay,"Only regret I have is the breakfast, could add bacon and sausage and make the breakfast a true hot breakfast."
Quality Inn North,1,Terrible hotel,The walls had unpainted spackle. There was a loose bulb hanging from bare wires in the bathroom. I told the front desk the bulb was a safety hazard and should be replaced but they didn't bother to fix it. I got the impression that they don't care about the condition of their own hotel.
Quality Inn North,1,We will NEVER stay in Quality Inn again!!!,"We will NEVER stay in Quality Inn again!!! My wife and I arrived at 11:20PM and no one was in the front desk. We waited for 20 minutes unattended and finally someone came to check us in. While we were in the room, we found one of the twin bed did not have blanket/comforter. We called 3 times and the last answer was the house keeper left and he would send us one TOMORROW MORNING. It was 1:30AM by then and we were all exhausted and decided to give up and sleep with A/C off."

Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,Siisti hotelli hyvll paikalla,Aamiaisen puuttuminen ihmetytt ?
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,Nice spot downtown,"Overall, this was a nice hotel in a convenient location. The room was clean and comfortable. It is a little expensive considering parking, Wifi, and breakfast aren't even included. We didn't have time to check out any of the restaurants or amenities. We enjoyed our stay."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,Weekend Getaway,"Weekend getaway with children.  Hotel is very nice and clean.  Easy access to shopping and activities, especially when weather is not best - love having the ""link"" walkway to Union Station and Crown Center shopping."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,"Nice pool, comfy beds and pillows.","Awesome pool, comfy beds, pillows. Great view of downtown, and easy to get to plaza or to crown center."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,2,Stayed at economy motels better than this one.,"The grout in the bathroom was filthy,  the rooms are out dated.  The noise we got being on the 39th floor must have been from poor insulated glass.  We could hear the cars driving.  The bed wall was aginst the two elevators running up and down all night.  The breeze way running to the vehicle garage was being used as the smoking area buy the staff.  It was suffocating coming in and out of the building.  The only time we ate there was first day in the morning.   The buffet was horrible.  The bacon was rock hard,  the powdered eggs tasted like caulk, the ham was nothing but grease.  Very unhappy with the meal.  And to top it off it cost $35.00 for two of us.  I had continental breakfast that had more to offer, and alot better taste. Adding the 34.00 for car parking,  the horrible breakfast,  and two nights of restless sleep.   It cost me 700.00.  This is a very unsatisfied customer that will post to other trends to let people know that this is hotel shouldn't even have a rating."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,Great stay,They are very accommodating and friendly!!-The only downside is there is no free parking at the hotel but besides that...it was great

Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,2,"Hotel is nice, you don't get what you're promised","We made reservations well over a month prior. However, after a long drive a two tired kids we were informed at check in that they were out of double beds. I get they made a lot of $ from a large group but we paid too! Could not care less either. Lier would be one word to describe this service"
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,great stay,"The staff was excellent! The only frustration I had was the cost of parking, very expensive."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,Kc weekend,"We have stayed here several times.  Always enjoyable.  Clean rooms, great staff.  Love the glass walkways to crown center."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,3,"great stay with hotel, Horrible 3rd party for park","The hotel stay was great. Stayed for a conference located at the hotel which was great as well. The only complaint I have is the parking. You can park in their parking garage connected to the hotel for a $16 charge, which is a little ridiculous. The hotel was good at compensating me for this as I was uninformed and unaware, but the third party company that rubs the toll through the garage was absolutely horrid!!! I was I could give negative reviews on them alone they one young lady in particular made my great weekend end in absolute anger while leaving. Tried to charge me almost $40 in charges for parking with the receipt from the hotel, staying that they had covered it for me."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,21st birthday party.,Definitely went above and beyond for our occasion. Even sent up a special dessert. We have many fond memories of staying when it was the Hyatt and was not disappointed. Great job. Especially at check in..our clerk was amazing. He made all details of our stay comfortable. Thanks.
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,2 night business trip,Great hotel! I enjoyed the city views from this high rise building.
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,2,Dissappointed!,"We took our two kids to stay at this hotel and we had so many undesireable problems during our one night stay, it really ruined the trip. My kids and I got stuck in the elevator which scared my kids to death and they were afraid to get back on the elevator. This was a problem since our room was on the 27th floor. We ordered desert from room service and only got half of what was supposed to come with it and the guy acted put out when I asked him to go and get the rest of the order. The jets on the hot tub were not working, the steam room was not working, and the room with the pool was all gross and really worn down. Our blankets had stains on them in the room and the toilet ran for 45 minutes after flushing which was really loud throughout the room. Housekeeping came and knocked on the door at 8am even though we had the do not disturb sign out. For a four star hotel it lacks the amenities you would expect. Internet was extra and we had to pay $15/day to park. The only good thing was the location and the view was great! Other than that, a huge dissappointment and not worth the money! The worst part was that no one even cared to ask about my stay when we checked out..."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,"Great location, great hotel.","The lobby was under construction on our visit (May 2012) and this made it very difficult to get around the hotel. Otherwise, it was great."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,2,Disappointed,"We we checked into the hotel, the lady was not very friendly and seemed to be lacking some customer service training. We had to let the water run for, at leas,t 5 minutes before taking a warm (not hot) shower. Also,the t.v. reception kept going in and out. The hotel was not kid/family friendly at all. The only restaurant available for breakfast was a ""sports bar"" that either sat 2 or 6 people and all the tables were the pub style which does not work very well for a 1 and 3 year old. The only option the staff gave us was to eat at another hotel restaurant."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,Scottsdale girl,Great stay very nice
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,concert venue,Good except there was only a breakfast buffet on Saturday morning.
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,Clean,"Very clean, nice updated rooms. Felt so comfortable in there I walked around barefoot and sat on the floor."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,Very easy access to historic sights and shopping,"We loved the hotel. We came for the Kansas City Marathon, and found the hotel centrally located for everything. We had no reason to even get into our car to go out, except for our friends wanted to go to a restaurant that was not near by. Had we chosen what restaurant we would have just stayed at the hotel and ate there. We did the Link, and went to the Crown Shopping Center it was pretty awesome. We also walked through Washington Park to go to Union Station. It was a beautiful hotel, and we loved the view from our room on the 38th floor. We also loved the hotel was so close to the Marathon event. We definitely will return, and stay at this hotel again."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,3,Sheraton not exactly the Hyatt,"I booked my trip with the understanding that I would be staying at a Hyatt Regency Hotel. I did not find out until I arrived that the hotel had changed hands as of Dec 1st and under construction.We arrived Christmas day. It was a mad house, a Chinesse Christian Convenetion was in progress, not a problem. The problem was that was the convention was the main focus of the hotel staff - no Coffee kiosk, no hotel shop and limited staff. We were able to get food from the Sports bar - not a very good experience, again no staff.The construction began at 8:00 AM and ended at 3:30 Mon through Friday.So loud we were moved 6 floors."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,Ok for famiky,The walls are very thin and the pipes are very noisy
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,Great location,We loved our stay. It was right by the Crown Plaza. We took the sky bridge to the crown plaza. The hotel was right beside the aquarium and Lego land. It was very clean and pleasant.
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,A Great Hotel!!,"The only negative thing I have to say is that when our room was cleaned & new condiments where left for us, not everything was replenished. But that is a very minor thing so I would say the overall stay/service was exceptional."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,Great rooms and service. Awful Spectators bar/food,"The hotel has lovely quiet rooms always cleaned and polished. The staff are friendly and efficient. Even on busy memorial weekend the place did not feel too crapped or rushed. It's sad to see their luxury 'Skies' rooftop revolving restaurant has gone bust.We had to eat dinner the first night at the 'Spectator's' bar which was awful. We went back for drinks later at night and the main bartender was rude, he fitted right into the ambiance of this nasty little nugget.The breakfast buffet is always one of the highlights of my stay at this establishment. It's reasonably priced with top quality selection and service. The terrace view is calming with all the trees and water fountains babbling in the background.The pool was just 'remodeled' for memorial weekend but as always it was over packed and there were about 15 chaise lounge chairs for a large hotel. The hotel must buy some chairs for the clients. We had to sit on the concrete both days with our 2 year old. Next time we will bring our own chairs.I talked to the staff who said the entire hotel is in a remodel phase and I'm sure they will address these minor details. I may have griped a bit that I still love the hotel it just needs some minor adjustments. If your with family and need a dinner just go down to the Westin through The Link they have a bar/restaurant that actually has main courses and cooked food with vegetables."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,Nice hotel with conference facilities,I was staying for a conference that was hosted at the hotel.
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,Great stay!,We stayed at this hotel when it was a Hyatt sot that was some time ago.  I would say that everything has improved since Sheraton took over.  The Staff is excellent as well as the restaurant and bar.  The room was very comfortable and quiet.
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,2,Expected more for the price.,"Location not as convenient as originally thought.  Still had to drive to dinner.  Pool is fairly small and seems a long hike from most rooms.  Very nice lobby, only two clerks for check in at 5:00 on a Saturday.  In the future I'll stay downtown or somewhere else.  Disappointed that Wi-Fi and parking were so expensive.  The parking garage two blocks away was free though."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,3,Location,"Location, Location, Location.... yes. But facility definately showing aging. Parking should be included in the cost of stay. It is kind of like saying rooms are $/ night, but you have to pay to use the toilet. But with that said location could not be better."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,Stay here,"This hotel was everything you you want in a hotel, staff was quick to point out how to avoid additional charges, volunteering services and assistance. Beds were nice, clean and the pillows were almost comicly fluffy. Close to everywhere in KC we wanted to go"
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,"Classy Hotel, Vibrant Area","We were in Kansas City to see ""Once"" at the Kaufmann Performing Arts Center and decided on this hotel for a good location, near the venue. We were beyond pleased with our stay in the Sheraton. The hotel is classy and the area is vibrant. So much to take in and appreciate. Our stay was a ""5"" across the board."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,2,My Stay!,"the hotel was beautiful! the staff friendly but the room was missing a few amenities such as no cream or sugar for coffee. Bell man left me in the hotel lobby with a full cart, 2 kids and a small dog in crate, after i had tipped him to take me upstairs. I had to manage by myself. Manager was very nice and gave us a comp breakfast buffet."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,Prom Pizzaz,"We didn't stay overnight, but rented the room so that my daughter and her friends could get ready for prom a few blocks away. Just so everybody knows...her dad and I were in the room at ALL times; no kids were left unsupervised. Her date needed a place to get ready because he had performed at a nearby arts event that ran right into Prom time, so he needed someplace close. The staff was wonderful and very accommodating. We got some really wonderful pictures; my favorite was when the kids were reaching for the chandelier and it looked like they were reaching for falling stars. The staff helped us stage some really cool shots, and were just fantastic. The room was very clean and comfortable with plenty of mirror space and plug ins for curling irons; the window added lots of good, natural light. Lots of closet space let the kids get ready for after prom without too much problem.The only negative I have is that the hotel shuttle was not available, although when I called earlier in the week to make sure it was, I was assured that it would be available and that I didn't need a reservation. We had to scramble for rides to prom, which worked, but was a last minute stress we hadn't planned on having."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,Great Hotel!!,We truly enjoyed our stay. The room was great and we definitely appreciated the hotel shuttle service to near by attractions and resturants. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,In Memory of ......,"This hotel has changed a bit in the lobby since that day in July 1981 when the skywalks collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring others.I was working at The Kansas City Star then and remember that disaster very well. The newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the Hyatt and the aftermath.I think it would be appropriate and in good taste for there to be a small plaque in the lobby noting the deaths and injuries of so many people and how building design has changed since.Today, the lobby looks quite safe, and I am sure it is. The Hyatt Regency disaster has gone down as one that has raised building safety to a much higher standard."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,Stop Over for Dance,"We were here for a three-day dance convention. We travel a lot, and this hotel was very excellent. The room was very clean and comfortable. The only complaint I have is the service in the restaurant was lacking. When I went for dinner, I had to pour my own glass of water and waited almost 20 minutes for a server to finally come to my table. Otherwise, the hotel was great."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,Very convenient to Sprint Center for concert,"The shuttle service was very convenient for concert goers, although the late return must have irritated to driver. He ran red lights, speedings, a little reckless. The hotel could use a coffee shop in the afternoons there only the bar open. It was a good location, Crown Center a block away. The Sheraton needs to get their name on the directories at the Crown Center to find the walkway."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,Overall good stay,Hotel room had great view. Was clean. Chic. And accommodating. However the air conditioning kept my partner from sleeping well that night. We stayed on 20 floor and in July Kansan heat he got hot. When we arrived the fridge was warm and barely cooled off our food.
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,nice hotel,we had a unknown visitor come into our room at 4:30am. it was strange. how she got in is unknown but when she tryed to get in bed with us my wife escorted her out of our room. very weird experience indeed.
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,3,Costs to much,"After paying $150-160 dollars for one night I was totally disappointed that there was no free breakfast or free WiFi and on top of that you had to pay $16 a night to park, totally outrageous!  I have had all of the above plus free parking at cheaper but nice hotels."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,4,Convenient Location,"Conveniently located, and the Link walkway was especially helpful."
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,5,Very nice hotel...close to WWI Museum,Very nice hotel...close to WWI Museum which we visited. Parking garage was close and secure. Room service was very nice and staff were quite courteous. Great view from upper floor (we were on floor 34 I think). Bed was quite comfortable. Price was reasonable for a Kansas City hotel in the middle of everything. Fridge in the room which is great. No free WiFi which REALLY chaps me for as much as one pays for hotels now...but overall a nice stay.
Sheraton Kansas City Hotel at Crown Center,2,Ok...,"Hotel was fine, big room, great view...but having to pay for WiFi, after paying so much for a room, as well as free WiFi for non-residents in the lobby? Over priced restaurant and bar, the top view is only for VIP guests, loads of people attending a conference over everywhere.....wouldn't stay here again. Disappointed after paying so much money then being asked to pay more for the basics...especially with the more attractive alternatives nearby."

Wyndham Houston - Medical Center Hotel and Suites,4,Poor Management,"Stayed two nights. Very noisy next door till after 11 each night. Ask if I could be moved. Was told when reported the next morning after the first night, that I should have called the Front Desk. Told her I did not wish to make anyone angry. I was by myself I am over 70. Breakfast was great. The hotel's shuttle was very accommodating."
Red Lion Inn & Suites McMinnville,2,Won't stay here again.,"Only staff that was friendly was the evening desk person. The Red Lion Inn Suites Manager McMinnville, OR is very VERY rude! Crystal!! We attempted to cancel our second night due to changes in our travel plans. A few hours after we checked in we were told checking out a day early was no problem so we made a reservation at another hotel a few hours further south in OR. When we went to check out we were told by Crystal that we would not be getting a refund for the second night because we were a pre-pay. She insisted that it was Expedia that would not permit the refund. She also said it was hotel policy that since it was a prepay the second night could not be refunded!! I called Expedia, and they tried to get the Crystal to release us from the second night and they were told NO, and Expedia had no choice but to honor the hotel policy. So now we had two hotel reservations. Fortunately Expedia was able to cancel the reservation we had made at the other hotel (without penalty). We later checked the hotel policy on-line and it did not say anything regarding no refund for cancelling a second night, only first night or no shows!! We brought this to Crystals attention, and she just said hmmm, Ill check into that. No apologies, no managerial flexibility in resolving our customer dissatisfaction, and she talked to us as if we were children. Red Lion did not care about our needs, only about selling out the hotel!! We doubt we will never stay at another Red Lion."

The staff was very nice and our room was comfortable. They provide a free breakfast and have a pool.
Red Lion Inn & Suites McMinnville,2,Probably won't return,"Room/hotel was not in great condition. Housekeeping left a note on first morning saying they had not cleaned the room because they were protecting our privacy - and we did not have a DND sign out, nor were we in our room late. Free WiFi was only free because it never worked. Breakfast food wasn't refilled - and there was still 30 min remaining."
Red Lion Inn & Suites McMinnville,4,Perfectly adequate,"The Red Lion is owned by the same corporation that owns the Vineyard Inn, also in McMinnville. The Red Lion is a perfectly adequate hotel.

Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,4,In town for a wedding,Stayed there well in town for a wedding. The front desk people were helpful. The little Lounge stayed open quite late which was a nice surprise. I would stay there again.
Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,2,Needs improvement,"My daughter and I checked in late after driving all day. The room we were originally set to be in was marked as not ready in the system, so we were assigned to a larger room. When we got into the room, overall, everything appeared to be clean. However, when we went to the bathroom to turn on the shower, we noticed that the shower/tub had not been cleaned (or if it had, it was not done well). There were several dark hairs still in the bathtub, as well as small stumbles from a man. This was quite disgusting and not what we wanted to deal with at the late hour. I did my best to wash out and wipe down the tub, but we quickly showered with our flip flops on and went to bed. In the morning, we woke up and checked out quickly because it just felt dirty in the room. I did let the clerk know about our room upon checkout, and she stated that she would let the head of cleaning know."
Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,5,Great place to stay,I was surprised when I arrived at this hotel. The staff are all very nice and helpful. The hotel is easy to find and is very close to the downtown area and sports arenas. The hotel has a nice restaurant and a nice sports bar. My hotel room was clean and seemed to have been recently updated.
Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,5,Great experience.,"A quick, overnight stay. This was our first experience with a Best Western and if they're all this good, we'll definitely look at Best Westerns in the future."
Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,5,Glad We Stayed at Cooper's Mill,"We were in Cedar Rapids for an event at the convention center, and I originally had made a reservation at the adjoining Double Tree. However, my wife searched on Hotels.com and instead booked a room at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel in order to save almost 100. It was a good choice. The Best Western is located just off I-380 and was only a short jaunt (.5 miles) to the convention center. While there was a bit of a funky smell in the first floor hallway, our room on the second floor was large and clean (my wife in particular noted how immaculately clean the bathroom was). We had a microwave and refrigerator in our room, and we also used the free WiFi. The indoor swimming pool was also on the 2nd floor, although we did not have time to take a dip on this trip. There is a bar and restaurant that adjoins the hotel, and we took advantage of their 1.25 frosty mug special (daily until 6 pm). As the event that brought us to town kept us up quite a bit later than our usual bedtime, we were glad for the noon check-out time. We would definitely stay again at the Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel the next time we overnight in Cedar Rapids."
Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,4,Best Western Cooper's Mill,"This is a great hotel in a quite spot, walking distance to downtown Cedar Rapids. The interior is dated but clean, same with the rooms. Plenty of free parking."
Best Western Cooper's Mill Hotel,5,Good place to stay near downtown!,"We were there for a youth wrestling tournament so we stayed for just 1 night. It was close to the events center, but it wasn't right in the downtown area where you'd have parking hassles. It was close to the interstate so we could easily get to other parts of the city."

Mohican Motel,3,We were just thrilled to get an inexpensive availability in Cooperstown!,"If you haven't been to Cooperstown before - especially during summer tourist season - you need to know that lodging within the village itself is at a premium - very limited availability, and what is available is very pricey. This was my 3rd visit to the area and the first time that I've actually been able to get a room... More"

Hilton Garden Inn Columbus/Grove City,5,Can we stay longer,Perfect accommodations with friendly service at a great value.

Hilton Garden Inn Columbus/Grove City,1,Not what I expected...,"We came here for our anniversary and booked a spa suite, it took the water 15 minutes to get warm and once it was warm 10 minutes later you were blasted with cold water.

Hilton Garden Inn Columbus/Grove City,5,Good choice,very nice staff. clean comfortable room. excellent cook to order breakfast 10 buck extra but worth it. They also offer cooked to order diners.
Hilton Garden Inn Columbus/Grove City,1,Very loud and Unsecured,"Hotel was filled with loud softball teams who ran up and down the hotel hallways until 1:30 am. Also, check your door when you leave your room. Our door did not shut completely and the outside exterior doors remained unlocked 24/7. This hotel needs better security."
Hilton Garden Inn Columbus/Grove City,5,5 stars!!,Everything was great!! We will definitely stay here the next time we come to Grove City!!

Best Western Adena Inn,3,Average Stay,"This motel is located close to where the Tecumseh drama is presented, so it is definitely convenient for those people in town for that purpose.

Red Roof Inn Tallahassee,4,No iron,I check in late so I didn't spend much time there but it was minus I could not get a iron
Red Roof Inn Tallahassee,1,not worth the over night stay.,"Just needed a place to stay for the night. Nothing fancy. When I arrived took 45 min to check in. There was another person and I trying to check in only. The man at the desk keep stopping to help everyone who would walk in leaving us just standing there. Even if it was just talking to the random that were walking in. When we finally checked in, there was nowhere to park. People who had rooms on the other side of the hotel was parked on our side so we had no place to park. My husband had to pull behind someone to get our stuff out then drove it to the gasstation and asked if we could park there for the night and he had to walk back to the room. Also, there was a party going on in the next room which wasn't that big of a deal cuz they weren't loud or disturbing us but because of the party they had this man that stood in front of our door trying to sell us drugs as soon as we walked up. Everytime we walked out he kept on. I have a 10 year old daughter that was with us. Called the front to let them know of this man and the guy at the desk just laughed and said oh yea he's here often, he won't bother you. UM I'M CALLING BECAUSE HE IS BOTHERING ME. Worst hotel I ever stayed at.. and I've stayed at some terrible hotels."

Red Roof Inn Tallahassee,2,Trip home from Disneyworld,"Don't know how this place has some many high reviews. The rooms were not well maintained or cleaned. The management photos are very misleading.

Viking Motel,4,"Great, Clean Hotel for the Value","We were traveling through here on a pretty tight budget. I searched for cheap hotels and found this. It looked good enough for what we were looking for, so I booked it. When we arrived, we noticed the outside was manicured beautifully. We checked in easily. The room was very nice. Had a bit of a musty smell when we... More"
Travel Inn,3,Dated but just about ok,"A basic, dated motel. On the positive side, it was very welcoming when I arrived and the room was clean and tidy. I can see the (newish) owner have made an effort, but really the property is in need of more upgrading than it's received."
Econo Lodge,4,Good for a night,I stayed here for one night while passing through Virginia. I had a comfortable second-floor room in which I slept well. Despite being close to the highway the place was quiet. In the morning a basic breakfast was available. On arrival I found that the ac in my room did not work but it was quickly fixed. I was not...

Quality Inn,3,Needs work,Place needs work. Staff was not friendly other then head housekeeping and Paul the bartender . Bed was comfortable. For having not much in the area the prices were high for a budget hotel. out dated only good for one night if that
Quality Inn,4,"Great room, friendly staff","Great room, very clean, comfortable bed, fridge in room, front desk staff are very helpful and friendly. I would've given 5 stars however the elevator to my floor has been broken since I got here and the stairwell does not smell very clean."
Quality Inn,3,Just passing through,"This was a nice place to stay. Other than the lady at the front desk being a little grouchy, I have not complaints. The room was clean. Bed was very comfortable. There were not noise issues, it was amazingly quiet. I would stay there again."
Economy Inn,2,Just plain cheap,Sorry..guess you get what you pay for...but a: NO hangers in room b. 1 chair (2 adults) c. No continental breakfast d. No pool It was 100 degrees when we checked in...at least the air-cond worked. Internet pass word was long enough to be aq security code for an IBM missile..
Red Roof Inn Salem,4,clean and you can't beat the price,"Although there's no special amenities, it is clean and more than affordable. Typically we are out shopping when visiting the area so we spend little time in the room. If you are just looking for a place to lay your head and use the money you save for shopping, this is your place!! :)"

Courtyard By Marriott Montvale,4,"Comfortable, Quier and near headquarter officess","If you are looking for a nearby hotel your headquarter offices, specially Mercedes Benz, this would be a perfect choice. It has all the needed services, nice restaurant and they offer you a shuttle service to and from office without charge."
Courtyard By Marriott Montvale,1,Underwhelming and COLD,"When I first got in the room I didn't remove my jacket because it was so cold. The room takes forever to heat up. The blankets are very thin. They are actual blankets, not your typical hotel comforter. This would be okay IF the room wasn't a freezer. - This hotel does not care when you have issues with things which is unusual but at least other hotels try to improve your experience. - I got sick because the room was so COLD and since I had a sore throat the next morning I called for a late checkout and of course they couldn't do it. Other less important things: TV movie ordering did not work and when I called the front desk they said they would send someone and never did"

Days Inn Wheelersburg Portsmouth,1,If I could give less than one star I would.,"Horrible. Never stay here. I would not have stayed if it wasn't non-refundable.

Hotel Nichols,5,Great stay,Stay in the Blue Room. It was really cute. The Inn was located right in town so we were able to walk everywhere. The cutest little lady owns the place. We had stawberry shortcake for breakfast and spent the whole time at the beach. the price was very reasonable as well. The owner even let us borrow her beach chairs. We are coming back for their blueberry festival. it is supposed to be HUGE.
Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Tampa North-busch Gardens Area,5,"Great Hotel, Great Value","We stayed at the hotel while visiting the USF campus.

Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Tampa North-busch Gardens Area,1,"If you want to be falsely charged, stay here.",To say that the hotel was sub-par would be an understatment.

When we were going to our room we had to go through the pool area. The pool was alright... More
Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Tampa North-busch Gardens Area,3,One night layover,We stopped here because of severe weather on our way to clearwater.

Orcas Suites At Rosario,5,Awesome place!,"If there is one piece of travel advice I feel most strongly about it would be GO TO ORCAS ISLAND!!. It's one of the most spectacular places I've ever seen!

Red Roof Inn Rockford,4,Best Deal for the Price!,"Looked for an overnight on a long journey so just wanted a clean, quiet, comfortable room at the cheapest price available and this establishment met those requirements for us. It's an excellent deal at a very excellent room rate. Loved our king size bed and tv and robust wifi. Very quiet,quick check in, clean surroundings. Obviously the management is quite particular about appearances as this is unusual compared to other Red Roof Inns we have seen. We picked it because of the other reviews and are impressed that the management responds to each review. That's personal attention! Our check in person was just neutral until I began a conversation. I think a welcome smile and greeting should be a given, but that is my only recommendation. Overall, for the price this hotel is exceptional."
Red Roof Inn Rockford,4,Positive...but had to clean,"One night stay, just needed a place to sleep and we have cat. Overall...very positive experience for price. One negative, we had to clean under bed (not pretty) to make sure our cat had a clean environment."
Red Roof Inn Rockford,4,A Dream Come True,This was an RR retreat for me and I enjoyed the peace and quiet and relaxing at Starbucks.
Red Roof Inn Rockford,3,Ok for a cheap one night stay,"I stayed for one night on my way to Indiana. Let's just say that you get what you pay for. It's was an ok stay. The room was kinda small, it needed several touch ups on the furniture/bathroom fixtures, the pillows were not good for the neck, and the bathroom was tiny. The good things were that the customer service was good and it was a nice location for exploring around town."
Red Roof Inn Rockford,3,Conveniently located on East State,Front hallway light was out when we first walked into our room. Super tiny bathroom but that was expected for the price. Only half the floor was carpeted and the remaining was super cold and hard on the feet. I had my house slippers but my husband had forgotten his. Great location in Rockford if you just need an inexpensive but convenient room for the night.
Red Roof Inn Rockford,4,"comfy, clean & affordable","Great, look foward to staying there in near future. Affordable, spacious rooms."
Red Roof Inn Rockford,3,Not the Greatest Red Roof,"This was a convenient stop on our road trip along route 90, but the quality was not as good as other Red Roofs. We had to request soap for the shower, and the sheets were worn out. There was a hole in the top sheet.Thank you for sharing your guest experience. We are sorry your guest experience was not everything you expected or deserve. We truly hope you give us another shot in the future."

We booked from hotels.com but the motel employee did not update the status of the room and we got the room didnot have hot water for shower.w hen we call to front desk they said they knew it and still they have us the room. No responsibility at all.
Motel 6 Mason,3,Our Sfay,The room on the ground floor smelled smoke even though it was a non smoking room. The carpets need fo be replaced. The staff were courteous. Breakfast had various choices and was well stocked.
Motel 6 Mason,4,Just in for tennis,"The people at front desk were very helpful when I couldn't get my wifi to work. It's nothing special, but sufficed. I was there for the tennis tournament, so just needed a safe place to stay and it worked. There was a shuttle to the tennis venue which was great."
Motel 6 Mason,5,in close proximity to family,comfortable and hospitable...would definitely stay here again....a great value!
Motel 6 Mason,2,You get what you pay for!!,Very disappointed in my visit! There was no iron or ironing board so I went wrinkled. They false advertised free breakfast in morning because they just switched from Days inn to home stay so they didn't have license to serve food yet. I will not be back
Motel 6 Mason,1,Disgustingly dirty,"There were dead bugs on the floor of the bathroom and carpet. There was dog fur or some sort of animal fur on the furniture. There was a cigarette burn on the sheets. The room smelled like mold. The comforter smelled bad. I didn't see any bed bugs but I was paranoid about it all night. The bed was lumpy and felt like it was going to tip off of the platform. I could not believe I paid 100 to stay in this room for a night, but everything was sold out."
Motel 6 Mason,2,Disappointed,False advertisement. No breakfast and no iron like quoted in description
Comfort Inn Suites,4,"Overall very good, would stay here again","The hotel is well maintained and kept clean. The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean.

The inn keeper gave us coupons for wine at the Grafton Winery and Restaurant where we enjoyed the sunset over the Mississippi. Breakfast was wonderful. I wish we could have stayed another night!
The Green Tree Inn,5,Looking Forward To Our Sixth Visit!,This was the fifth time that we've stayed at this BB and it was just as charming as the first. Connie and Gary are such gracious hosts!

Hampton Inn Bedford,4,Trip through Pennsylvania,The hotel was very conviently located and close to several restaurants. It was also close to the highway and an historical village. The staff was very nice and helpful and called our room to verify our comfort.
Hampton Inn Bedford,4,Great Views of the Mountains,"The hotel sits nicely high on a hill off the interstate overlooking the mountains. It's one of only 2 commercially known hotels in Bedford that I saw (the other was a Fairfield Inn). It was a bit pricy for a Hampton but the room was very nice. Our room had two windows facing the mountains, king bed, couch, 2 chairs,... More"

Ramada Platte City KCI Airport,1,Disgusting,"This hotel is absolute garbage. From the quality of the rooms to the entire staff,absolutely nothing held up to standards you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Good luck if you want to actually make it to the airport on time, their shuttle service was a complete joke."
Ramada Platte City KCI Airport,3,Good place to stay if you park fly,Staff was friendly and efficient especially when transporting to and from the airport. Service was quicker than using the long term parking at the airport. We will definitely stay here again when flying out of KC airport. Bed was comfortable and for the price it was nicer than other places we have stayed. Our only complaint was the bathroom floor... More
Ramada Platte City KCI Airport,4,Our stay,The hotel is very clean and the only problem we had was the TV would not reach a volume that we could hear.

Ramada Platte City KCI Airport,2,Very Disappointed,"This was my second stay with a Ramada branded hotel. I had such high hopes for our stay since the previous Ramada we stayed with was such a good experience, unfortunately I cannot say the same for this stay. At check in the desk clerk was in my opinion very ill mannered almost rude like she wanted to hurry us... More"

Hampton Inn & Suites Woodstock Va,5,Nothing Short of Amazing,"Stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during our visit to Virginia last year.

This hotel was such that as we planned our winter vacation for 2016,... More"
Theater Motel,3,"Comfortable bed, but motel needs a lot of help.","The reason I choose this motel was it was the least expensive motel in the area with a total cost with all taxes and fees of about 70.00 a night. Though not expensive, it is a higher end price especially for a motel and for that you would expect to have a very decent to excellent motel room. That was... More"
Theater Motel,3,A basic stopover with an good price,This motel looks like it was once a family gathering place. There is an old swing set and gazebo. The theatre theme in the rooms is giving way to an update of the decor. The motel was our stopover between dives on the Osprey. There is not much choice in town unless you look to a bed and breakfast or... More
Theater Motel,4,Just what we needed.,"Was looking for a place to sleep that was clean and easy to get on and off Interstate 90, that didn't cost and arm and a leg.

"The Siena Hotel, Autograph Collection",5,Great spot for a getaway,"You really don't need to leave this hotel between check-in and check-out, except of course we did.

Baymont Inn & Suites Boone,2,"Hotel was alright, but needs some help....","We stayed at this hotel because it was in Boone (Iowa) and we had a visitation there and a funeral the next morning. It was clean, but we did have some issues. The smaller coffee pot (5 cup) was nice to have in the room, but it didn't work correctly. The bathroom was clean, but the tub had a really slow drain. There was a clock radio in the room, but it wasn't set to the correct time (a personal pet peeve) so I had to set it - and it was really difficult to figure out and then it was bolted down to the table with only about 3/4 leeway on the cord, so we also couldn't move it out a little bit to be able to see the time if either of us woke up during the night (again, a personal issue). However, the breakfast in the morning was really well stocked...basic continental breakfast foods with 2 waffle makers...so not very varied, but was good. Staff was in and out making certain that there was enough food out and cleaning off tables that had been used. If you need to stay in Boone, it would be alright - as long as that is all that you are expecting. Otherwise, I would suggest staying in Ames and driving over since it isn't all that far away."
Red Roof Inn Flint-bishop Airport,2,Clean Room.,Clean room. No frills.
Red Roof Inn Flint-bishop Airport,1,Hellbilly travels,"Only had to change rooms once( no a/c) Here is a few other issues no tv ,wifi broken bathroom door, dripping water, toilet running. Employees were nice They told me I would get a good discount if I stayed. Still waiting!"
Red Roof Inn Flint-bishop Airport,1,Worst Experience with a Hotel Ever,"We got to the hotel about an hour or two early and asked if we could check in early and the receptionist said no, not until check in time. Understood so me and my friend grabbed food. We got back to the hotel and checked in. We walked into our first room and it was a disaster. There were holes in the bed sheets and they had a rank smelled. We went back to the front desk and changed our room. In the second room, the bed sheets had black stains and rips in them. So I went back to the front desk and changed again. The third room - one of the beds had holes and rips in the bed sheets. I went back to the front desk and expressed my frustration. She said she would have a house maid change the bed sheets. The next morning when we went to shower there was only 1 bath towel in the shower. We called the front desk and they said they would have towels to our room quickly. About 30-40 mins later, a hotel maid comes to our door and hands us a small face/hand towel saying all the other towels are getting washed right now. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had."
Red Roof Inn Flint-bishop Airport,5,Happy overnight stay,I was happy considering I used to live in Flint and I'm wary about the hotels there. Everything was clean and in good condition. Shower was hot and staff was nice. Area is very convenient.

Econo Lodge,2,Decent but nothing exciting,"The hotel is decent but lacks pizazz. Its kind of stuck in the 70's. However its still clean, functional, and a budget friendly place to lay your head for a night or two. Dont expect a lot for what your paying. Your not going to pay much so your not going to get much."
Econo Lodge,1,Called to Cancel,I called to cancel my reservation because I booked in the wrong place.

Ramada Costa Mesa/Newport Beach,5,Good location,Nice hotel with a lovely pool. Near to Newport Beach. It is on a busy intersection and is hard to get in and out of.

Americas Best Value Inn - Greeley/Evans,1,Excellent place to stay...if you are desperate!,"Lets see...where to begin. Perhaps it was the dust storm created on a windy day by the unpaved lot next door that created a scene from the Grapes of Wrath as the Joads outran a duststorm that literally almost obliterated the hotel. Perhaps it was the bathroom, urine smell that greeted you as you entered the lobby the 1970s carpets,... More"

Best Western Empire Towers,5,Great hotel near shopping area,"This hotel was good in all respects. The only complaint I can think of was the heating system in the room was a little too noisy. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. The breakfast was great, and the room was very comfortable. No complaints other than the one I first mentioned. You will like staying here."
Best Western Empire Towers,2,Hotel badly needs an upgrade,"Bad value for the price. Room was dirty, carpet stained and curtains torn. Breakfast was adequate, well-prepared. Had to report noisy tenants on the floor above, they finally went to sleep or passed out...not certain staff did anything about the problem. Exterior was littered and needed cleaning up."
Best Western Empire Towers,4,Nice place to stay but internet was not working,Our room was comfortable and clean. The only drawback that we found was that we could not access the internet and the attendant did not know how to remedy the problem. The breakfast was excellent with several options to choose from.
Best Western Empire Towers,4,Good place to stay.,excellant breakfast - great cookies in the afternoon-friendly staff and very clean Only compliant was that other guests were banging their doors very early in the morning and staff scraping sidewalk with shovel very early
Best Western Empire Towers,3,noisy pipes,The exterior and lobby were very unappealing. Very blah. The room was better--updated and clean. However at least 3 times water pipes clanged and thunked. One time was during the night and it woke of us. Not happy about that. The area around the hotel was only fair looking.
Hampton Inn Suites Oklahoma City Airport,5,Weekend in OKC!,"Check in was fantastic! The rooms were clean. They have a fantastic pool for kids, which was great since we have a two year old.

After a long day of scuba diving it was wonderful to go and relax in the hot tub. Breakfast wasn't very good though. Pool food quality and not very good selections.
Days Inn Princeton,2,Won't clean,Pubic hair laid on tub next to shampoo bottles all week. When staying all week room only gets cleaned twice a week. I have been on the road for 25 yrs never had my room cleaned only twice a week. Cob webs on ceiling. Didn't pay 40 a night either I would have expected this at that price.
Days Inn Princeton,1,Do Not Stay Here!,The place is a dump. Room was filthy and looks like it wasn't cleaned. I stood at the front desk for 5 minutes before she even acknowledged me. The room was musty and was almost afraid to lie down on the sheets because of bedbugs. Stay anywhere else but here. This place should be condemned.
Rodeway Inn Suites,2,Don't plan on going here again.,The carpet was dirty. Coffee in the morning was cold. Chain lock on the door was gone. Reserved it for three adults. Only two towels and no blankets or sheets for sofa bed.
Rodeway Inn Suites,1,Not good.,Not pleasant at all. Loud noises and voices after midnight. Parking lot and stairs in a very bad condition. People who checked me in and out seem to be too busy and in a bad mood.
Rodeway Inn Suites,1,Bulldoze it,"Worst place I've ever stayed. Toilet leaked, shower faucet was broken. So noisy, was like sleeping on the highway. Beds old and not comfortable. Weird people lurking around. I just can't even explain how terrible it was except to say I recommend t they just bulldoze the whole thing."
Rodeway Inn Suites,1,"Experience ""the lowest common denominator""!","The purpose of my trip was to attend the wedding and reception of a friend's daughter. I was only driving up for this, and was not concerned about luxury and amenities. From the pictures, etc., that I viewed on-line, it looked like a good place for a brief stay. However, the whole hotel is in great need of maintenance work. The metal walkway and steps outside the rooms were rusty. The bathtub was old, caulking needed, mildew stains on a plastic towel holder. There were water spots on the sink handle when we arrived. Towels and washcloths provided were threadbare. Cigarette butts littered the parking lot and the metal walkway and steps. The advertised continental breakfast was definitely bare bones--bread, bagels, and waffles to pop in a toaster, cold cereal and milk, muffins, coffee, tea, and orange juice available. No yogurt or fresh fruit. Had I not prepaid for the room, I would not have stayed. My friend and I decided to wait to shower or bathe until we'd done the four-hour drive home."
Rodeway Inn Suites,1,"Dirty, stink, no air conditioner!","I could not stay because the room that was given to my family and I was dirty and with a bad smell. The sheets had yellow dirty spots and to add to all this, the air conditioner did not work. The hotel did not want to give my money back, but when I called Hotel.com they took care of everything to me. I've got my refund."
Rodeway Inn Suites,4,Cleaner and stopper,"Shower wall had old scum on it. So I took a bath, but not tub plug to stop up the water. Help them room 122."

Quality Inn & Suites,5,Quality Inn Tarpon Springs Exceeds Expectations,"We traveled to Tarpon Springs for two reasons: three business meetings and a dear friend's 75th birthday celebration. The hotel staff members were very nice and helpful. The hotel was lovely and clean, and our room was comfortable and accomodating. The free hot breakfast was an unexpected bonus! Quality Inn Tarpon Springs is certainly a budget-friendly, conveniently-located hotel, and it totally exceeded our expectations! We will definitely consider staying there for future business and personal trips to Tarpon."

Quality Inn & Suites,4,Weekend in Tarpon,"I thought it a little pricey for the condition of the hotel, but overall not bad. Pool area was nice, bar area was nice."
Quality Inn & Suites,4,Comfortable and Affordable,"Overall I had a great stay at this hotel. I was traveling alone with three children four years old and younger and needed a place to overnight that was safe, affordable and comfortable. The room was a great size, the beds and pillows were very comfortable and the linens were good quality. We arrived after midnight and the hostess that greeted us was very friendly and helpful. The breakfast spread was nice and the pool area looked amazing though sadly we had no time to enjoy it. Only negative I had with this stay is that I requested a crib for the night and it was not set up when we got into the room. Unfortunately we checked in so late that although there was a crib available for the front desk to provide one, were no linens for it. Since I had a portable one in my car this wasn't a big deal for me (other than an extra trip out to the parking lot)."
Quality Inn & Suites,2,OK for one night,"Old run down furniture, room needed to be repainted, peeling paint, curtains ripped and dirty, carpet ok, but room was not as clean as it should be. Only good items in room was bed, tv, refrigerator, microwave, balcony room, shower head. Bathroom wasn't properly cleaned and definitely needs to be spruced up. Facility itself is nice with attractive lobby, pool, convenient."
Quality Inn & Suites,4,Family celebrations,Was visiting with family in the area. This hotel is convenient to restaurants and museums.
Birchwood Motel,5,Well kept,My wife and I were hoping for clean and found it to be extremely well kept. The gentleman that checked us in was very friendly as well. Located in a great location to visit the local bars and restaurants. We would stay again.
Birchwood Motel,2,Very poor accommodations,Very disappointed. Motel was clean but lacked amenities. I was charged 79 for a Friday night stay. They advertised 60 for double occupancy. Was told weekend rates were 10 higher Will not recommend this motel.

In fact, it is above average, even compared with its big city counterparts. Clean, well-maintained and comfortable. That's all we ask.

Rodeway Inn,1,BED BUGS,"Woke up to many red, itchy bites all over my body. I'm so disgusted. Front counter guy was very rude noisy children laughing talking in the middle of the night.

Comfort Inn Lucky Lane,3,heated pool???,The room was clean and quiet even with the freeway right across the street. Breakfast was OK but nothing to write home about. It has an indoor heated pool but it must of been heated by the moon because we didn't feel the heat only from the jacuzzi. Other than a cool pool we had a great trip.

Sleep Inn,4,Good stay,"Room was a bit small, well furnished, very clean. Very quiet. Would stay again. Right on the Interstate but is very quiet. Breakfast is minimal but the area is very clean.

Wyndham Garden San Jose Silicon Valley,3,Bad Hotel,"The hotel is OK, decent bed but very old decor and cheap, can not find place to put bath amenities, there is one small sink which has no space. The housekeeping does not change sheet everyday, she cut herself and left all her bloody on the sheet and comforter, so terrible. Overall the room looks cheap....Would not go back."
Wyndham Garden San Jose Silicon Valley,4,Business,Nice remodel.
Wyndham Garden San Jose Silicon Valley,4,Great affordable!!! Congested parking!,"Hotel looks great, staff was attentive, parking was congested and hard to find!!"
Wyndham Garden San Jose Silicon Valley,1,Not a very professional front desk staff!,"I have stayed at the Holiday Inn Twice! Both times we had problems with the rooms. The first time it was the room that was dirty (used condoms on the floor, found by my grandchildren) they did not come in to clean the room until 10:30pm.On July 3,2011 I also reserved 2 adjoining rooms. The outside of the Hotel was a mess. The plants and trees were all dead. The inside was being remolded and was okay. They workers kept it nice and clean. The girls at the front desk did not seem to know what they were doing! It took two of them to figure where we were supposed to stay and how to charge us. I ended up getting overcharged for the rooms and to make matters worse I was double charged. When I called them, I left a message for the someone to call me back. They said it would be in a half hour. Well one and a half hours later I had to call. They would not put me through to the manager. They even hung up on me. Mind you I was not that upset at that time. I just wwanted to get someone to take care of the problem without me having to tell 5 people. Give me the right one the first time. I finally got the desk manager and she wanted to call me back, I told her no I would not take that chance. She said she would look it up and call me back. Now I am waiting for her call. Wish me luck!Now mind you the hotel was being remodeled and that was fine. But the pool area was dirty! There were glasses on all of the tables and towels laying around. (actually we should pick up after ourselfs). the water was not clean and not clear. We did take our towels out of the rooms with us and took them back in. We asked the desk for clean ones and we got them right away brought to our room. It was 1:p.m. when we were in the pool. this Holiday Inn is the olny hotel close to my brothers house. But believe me next time will stay somewhere esle. I might have to drive further but maybe I will have a better stay!"
Wyndham Garden San Jose Silicon Valley,4,"Sat., Sept 17, 2016","Check in was easy. Room was clean except that it appeared that the toilet was not flushed. All free coffee, bottled water, and bath essentials were fully stocked with clean linens and sheets. WiFi worked great."
Wyndham Garden San Jose Silicon Valley,3,"Nice, clean affordable hotel.","I thought it would be nicer than best western or comfort inn, since it's by Sheraton but it's not. The room size is about the same, I got double beds. There's no free breakfast. There's not much establishment around the area. Better go to downtown San Jose. It's still a nice clean hotel with comfy bed and pillows. I'd still recommend it because it's affordable. Maybe I expected too much."
Wyndham Garden San Jose Silicon Valley,4,Happy customer,"I have to say that I was scare at first that my reservation was going to be denied, because there was many people with that problem before me. But when it was my turn, everything went well and actually because the hotel was full, they gave a better room for the same price. I was happy because it was comfortable and we had a great night of sleep after a very busy day."
Wyndham Garden San Jose Silicon Valley,5,San Jose Ole,Our trip was for business. We found the staff to be very helpful. We would stay there again.
Wyndham Garden San Jose Silicon Valley,4,Difficult to rate,"Ok, their computers were down when I checked in. The wait to check in was too long AND the person behind the desk allowed another guest to deliberately cut in front of me and when questioned I was given an explanation of 'I don't know'. Then when I checked in, I was given the wrong room because someone was already in it. When I went back to lobby, there was another long wait because apparently other guests were given the wrong room also. Also, the card I checked in with for incidentals was charged for the stay, even though, I've already paid through hotels.com. I am aware that circumstances arise that are sometimes out of their control and I believe the the situation was handled to the best of their ability. I was given free items from the lobby fridge for the rude guests that cut in front of me AND my room was upgraded for free because I was initially given the wrong room. Lastly, I was completely reimbursed for them charging twice on my card. The situations were handled efficiently and the staff was accommodating to my concerns, questions and needs."

Red Roof Inn - Richmond South,5,Everything was fine,good
Red Roof Inn - Richmond South,3,It was ok.,"Red Roof Inn is 100, smoke free, but that doesn't prevent people from smoking right outside their doors and therefore talking every hour in a half outside your door too and the smell of smoke that surrounds you every time you walk out or in. The room is what you pay for, location is right off the highway so convenient, it is 10 to 15 minutes away from everything."

Red Roof Inn - Richmond South,5,Good stay,Staff was courteous and room was very clean. Watch out for the 1.50 insurance charge for the room safe. Never seen that one before and did not like that I had to request at checkout that it be removed rather than at check in.

Radisson Hotel Freehold,2,A wedding hotel - avoid,"I have had to stay here quite a few times over the past few years. Staff nice, room clean, nice beds,etc,etc. BUT. Terrible acoustics mean you hear everything. And as they have wedding parties every weekend you have to suffer noise and disruption from wedding guests staying in the hotel. Up until 5am at times. No sleep for me. Smoking and drinking outside the front lobby, and no one to stop them until I phoned at 2am to complain. Where is the noise coming from , I was asked Right in front of you , I said. They need to MANAGE this. Not put non wedding guests on floors with guests, and they should put polite notices up about noise. During the week fine - but avoid the weekend unless you like being kept up all night."
Radisson Hotel Freehold,4,"Nice hotel, good location","The hotel itself was fine--accommodating and clean, and the room was spacious. I found the bed, however (a SleepNumber bed) very uncomfortable and couldn't manage to change the preset number. The restaurant was just so-so. The food wasn't very tasty. On the night we checked in I had a grilled chicken sandwich with roasted peppers and pesto that I thought would be really good--the sandwich was heavy on the roasted peppers but the pesto was almost non-existent. The following morning we had the buffet breakfast. It was a wonderful spread--fruits, cereal, eggs, potatoes, sausages, french toast sticks--but the pastries and french toast were stale and the eggs seemed very bland. On the plus side the waiter said that if we didn't want scrambled eggs we could have eggs made to order (we hadn't complained, he simply offered that). So I'm fine with the hotel in general (I admit the bed problem may be mine alone), but wish the restaurant was as good as the bed."
Radisson Hotel Freehold,4,Last minute stay,We are having work done in our home and needed somewhere comfortable to stay that wasn't too far for my husband to commute to work and so I could get my daughter to school on time. Glad we chose the Raddison. It was comfortable and convenient.

Milwaukee Airport Inn,3,Bites,"Kept getting bit by something in the bed,not sure if it was bed bugs or not."
Milwaukee Airport Inn,2,Dissappointed,The bathroom stunk. Carpet dirty. The front clerk was not very nice. Restaurant closed early. Snow plowing was poor and the person plowing was not paying attention very well.
Milwaukee Airport Inn,3,It serves its purpose,"My room or hallway didnt smell funny, the staff was friendly helpful, and there wasn't any loud noises or unruly guests. I had hotwater and the heater worked. As far as the room itself, you get what you pay for..No hangers, old furniture poor tv reception/wifi. The bed was comfortable enough. If you just need a place to crash or need to save this place works. Things that made me giggle: the phone in the room was from the Marriot in another state, the sheet that had the list of tv channels had a different hotel name on it, the advertisement for a pizza place that will deliver to your room has relocated and no longer does the keycard does not have the Inn's name on it but does have another pizza advertisement (different place) all over it again says they will deliver to your room, ya, no its out of the area."
Milwaukee Airport Inn,1,Will never stay there again,First off they way over charged me. Beds were terrible had cigarette burns in the comforter. Entry ways to rooms smelt terrible. Stains and trash on the floor. Safe was not functional. Toilet was stained. There was mold on the window drapes. Emergency exit would not shut or lock. Cigarette butts all over the ground out side of the room. Pool was not functional. Trash on room patios. There was a Bullet hole in a window.
Milwaukee Airport Inn,1,No lock on the door!,"It was so dark and deserted looking when we drove up we thought it was closed up. I booked online and they couldn't find my reservation.

Microtel Inn by Wyndham Henrietta/Rochester,3,Used to be Nice....,"I chose this Microtel because I had stayed here before about eight years ago and it was very nice. At the time it typified a Microtel - clean, efficient, comfortable, modern. This particular Microtel has gone downhill. The wall above the closet was damaged, the tub was worn, and the plumbing under the sink was disgustingly filthy. There are a number of lodging options within a block the next time I need to stay in this area I will use one of them."
Microtel Inn by Wyndham Henrietta/Rochester,1,Breathtakingly Incompetent Staff,"The hotel clerk checked someone else into our room and we were awoken in terror at 1 am by someone attemping to enter our room (their key opened the door but we had the slide lock closed). Never had a problem with Microtel in the past, but this was so far beyond unacceptable that we'll never stay at one again."
Microtel Inn by Wyndham Henrietta/Rochester,2,Previous Guests Garbage in My Closet- Really?,"Comfortable bed for the night. My first impression was quite good for the price. Then I opened the closet door and discovered the garbage from a previous guest (ancient pizza in box, used plates, used napkins) stacked inside. Looked like it had been there a long, long time. It's amazing how fast your impression of a place can change. Wish the person at the desk had been a little more concerned about it when I told her. I did not leave with a great impression of the place."
Microtel Inn by Wyndham Henrietta/Rochester,5,stay compatible!,"Rates are reasonable and service is good, I have been staying at Micro hotel in Henrietta and Victor N Y. At different times for few years and will continue to do so in the future."
Microtel Inn by Wyndham Henrietta/Rochester,4,Breakfast,"Great place. Bed was firm, room was clean and convenient for what we needed it. A bit small but... Can't believe what they offer is considered breakfast. Can you say sugar and carbs. mini muffins, sugary cereals, and juices. Not one thing good for you! Terrible! I guess that is what an American breakfast consists of now Scary!"

Microtel Inn & Suites Orlando (Universal Studios),2,You get what you pay for,"Our first impression was that the hotel was just run down. Our room had broken furniture, disintegrating drywall and wood, an air conditioner that left a growing shopping wet puddle and beds a pillows that no one would find comfortable. The continental breakfast consisted of slices of bread, waffles, bagels, fruit loops and apples. To bad for you if you are gluten intolerant or just want some protein for breakfast. The free shuttle only picked up twice a day and would leave on our before the scheduled time so you had better be there early. You still might not get on, because it's just a large van and they had to call a second shuttle for you to wait for. The hotel staff could be rude and curt or helpful and curt, it's a roulette. By the end of our stay the maids didn't seem to care. They just threw the covers on no matter what was under them and didn't bother to clean. Since it's just a place to lay down after the amusement parks I guess if serves is purpose."

Microtel Inn & Suites Orlando (Universal Studios),1,Hotel is awful!,"Second time in a row that we have had an awful experience with the hotel booked through your website. Your website gave the hotel 3.2 stare. I would agree if the scale was out of 100, not 5. One of the two queen beds had the mattress springs bulging through surface. The bathroom was dirty and I killed 3 roaches."
Microtel Inn & Suites Orlando (Universal Studios),5,Time to ourselves,The chilis down the road is a little wait but the food and service is amazing. Nightlife is a drive but it's nice to park your car at one and walk I drive. The beds are a little hard but still got a good nights sleep.
Microtel Inn & Suites Orlando (Universal Studios),5,pleasant and sweet stay,My stay was very pleasant and jackie and maggie make my stay better.Ty girls!!
Microtel Inn & Suites Orlando (Universal Studios),3,You get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for...while the rate was good (I stayed from Sunday July 10th to Sunday July 17th for 502), some of the people greeted you and some didn't greet you. The outlets in the room barely worked. The mirror behind the bed is a little weird unless your into that type of thing. The continental breakfast was extremely bare, so I ended up eating out, unless you like only bread and waffles then your golden..the pool is extremely small..the location is great because you can walk the strip and everything is around that area but you have to deal with the traffic. All in all for the price it was ok, I am not going to be praising the hotel's name anytime soon..I have stayed in Motel 6 and Red Roof Inn with better service than this hotel...save up for a better hotel"

La Quinta Inn Roanoke Salem,3,Great for pets not for humans,"The hotel caters to pets, and that's fine when you need it. The room was dirty (expected since there are so many animals involved).

La Quinta Inn Roanoke Salem,3,Hurry and get your breakfast!!,"We were pleased with our stay, for the most part. The carpeting in the hallway seemed kinda dirty, but our room was clean. I didn't like that breakfast was only until 9 am. And the breakfast hostess, who was very nice, started taking it all down at 8:50. She did tell someone if they wanted yogurt, she would go in the back and get it. But I felt like I had to rush through breakfast."
La Quinta Inn Roanoke Salem,4,clean and quiet and basic -,"stayed here for a dog show weekend. Really appreciate being able to keep my dog with me here. Grounds are well maintained, but I did step in another dog's feces outdoors...dog bags would be great and a handy trash can. Room was clean and quiet and close to dining and museaums and 81. Bedding was lacking however - thin and even an extra blanket did not help much. Shower rocked and loved having a bathtub. Refridgerator never did get cold and the food I brought spoiled. good breakfast."

Baymont Inn & Suites Pueblo,4,Travel Vacation,This was a nice hotel. They had a small pool but a decent size hot tube. Just a large shower no bathtubs which I prefer it the kids aren't with us. Rate was pretty good. 99 a night for king bed. It had the sink out side the bathroom which I like so the mirror isn't fogged up when you... More
Baymont Inn & Suites Pueblo,4,Comfortable Beds,"The breakfast was the only disappointment. Hard boiled eggs,sausage that the attendant had to warm in the microwave and add to the serving dish and then it was not hot. I was surprised to see her put the freshly warmed on top of the sausage already in the pan that was serving temperature. I was taught to remove old and place new in bottom and first cooked on top. The area is very small also. Train is close when it comes by in the night and may disturb others but we like trains."
Baymont Inn & Suites Pueblo,3,June 30 Stay,"The hotel was nice and the price was good also. You should know it's right beside the train tracks and the train comes by regularly, so keep that in mind especially if you're a light sleeper. They also close the laundry room at 10 pm which isn't posted, I found that very inconvenient. What if you use the pool late... More"

Americas Best Value Inn,4,Great service!,Went for a football weekend to watch ND. We are return customers who stay here every year at least once.

Americas Best Value Inn,5,Friendly Host,"The room was clean, the beds very comfortable, and the property well maintained, but it was the friendly, warm-hearted proprietor who made this place special.

Americas Best Value Inn,4,Nice place at the right price,"This is a place for those that desire a clean room, and a safe place to stay. This is about 10 minutes off Hwy 80.

Americas Best Value Inn - Executive Suite Airport,1,painful,"Room was huge, continental breakfast in the morning, good location close to airport, friendly staff - everything great, except the bed bugs. Unfortunately, that's a deal breaker - woke up with about 30 bites on hands, legs neck. Hopefully you won't get the same room. If the bugs were gone, my quality value ratings would be high!"

Americas Best Value Inn - Executive Suite Airport,1,comfortable rooms yet horrible!,"We stayed for one night after coming to and leaving from Alaska.

Americas Best Value Inn - Executive Suite Airport,2,A 2 star older hotel can still be clean,I note there have been some renovations to this hotel however no matter how much you renovate you still need to employ enough staff to keep a hotel clean and well maintained.

Culver Cove Resort,3,Convenience at a cost,"This is the second time I've stayed at The Cove for various reunions at the academy. Each unit is owned privately and rented out as needed. There is an indoor pool and beachfront access with piers. All units have balconies and I think most are 2 bedroom. During this most recent stay, it appeared the unit had been renovated, but... More"
Culver Cove Resort,2,Disappointment,"We had stayed at the Culver Cove years ago and were hoping things hadn't changed. We were disappointed to find the look of the inn has deteriorated.

Indian Lodge,4,Passing thru...,Love this out of the way place. Comfortable bed. Clean room. Clean bathroom. Neat old wood floors that creak when you walk. The only downfall for some may be no WIFI in the room. You can go to a common area and tap in. Lovely quiet place. Office folk very nice.
Holliday inn Folly Beach,4,It is what it is,"Quirky but clean and comfortable. No it's not a five star but resort but it doesn't pretend that it is, it's actually better because it has character and fits in perfectly with the Folly scene (which is quickly disappearing)."

Hollywood Inn Express South,1,This hotel is the WORST!!,"The man at check desk was rude and yelled at me. The door was poorly hung, therefore you could see light, the bathroom fan was so loud you could not shower with the light on, there was a very thin and hole filled blanket on the bed, there was no coffee pot or microwave as promised, the fridge froze the contents, the carpet was gross on bare feet, and there were no hand towels only a wash cloth and bath towels. Was robbed by this stay. WAY more money than it was worth!!!!!"

Motel 6 Norfolk,4,Vacation part 1,Its well worth what you pay. The pool is the hugest I have seen at a hotel! The staff is polite and friendly. Some kinda shortage of housekeepers and waited two hours on checking into a reserved room. Once there it was good we booked a double with a kitchenette. Spacious and convienient. Will be returning.

Poor security in the parking lot, minimal cameras.... More"

Hampton Inn & Suites Rochester/Victor,5,Great experiences or the family-excellent value!,"Extremely pleased with our hotel stay. We are a family of 5 and recently spent 2 nights at this hotel. I was pleasantly surprised at the size of our suite and the friendliness of the staff. There is a popcorn machine in the lobby, which my kids loved. We also caught the staff setting out warm chocolate chip cookies in the evenings-YUM! Such a nice homey touch! The free breakfast was outstanding. We traditionally don't expect much from a hotel spread, but this one was the exception. Lots of selections, and the hot options changed from one morning to the next. Breakfast attendant was friendly and helpful, and kept everything well stocked as the crowd ebbed and flowed. The only negatives were an extremely loud family in the room above us that kept us awake until almost midnight. The hotel staff did they best to help and even offered to move us, but we opted not to take them up on the offer. Nothing else the staff could have done to help that situation. I was also disappointed that the hot tub wasn't working, but the kids had a wonderful time in the pool regardless."
Hampton Inn & Suites Rochester/Victor,5,Great Friendly Staff :-),Great Experience considering the horrible weather we were having. The staff was exceptionally nice and friendly. Breakfast was very good and the location in all was very clean.
Hampton Inn & Suites Rochester/Victor,4,"Nice quiet hotel, but bathrooms need updating.","This Hampton was consistent with my other experiences at their properties, which is why I like staying there. The room was comfortable and well insulated from ambient noise, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the breakfast offered a decent variety of hot/cold items. The one exception was my disappointment with the condition of the bathroom, which had paint peeling on the ceiling, and a tub that was stained from age. It could use a refreshing, and detracted from an otherwise satisfying Hampton experience."
Best Western The Inn At Rochester Airport,2,My stay,The pictures of the hotel looked better on line. The staff was ok not great. No one looked like they wanted to be there. It was supposed to be a non smoking hotel but someone on my floor kept smoking which was a turn off. The room was clean but they didn't leave conditioner or moisturizer and left one teeny shampoo. When I went to the front desk to ask for products I was told they only had a few! Was. It pleased with our stay at all
Best Western The Inn At Rochester Airport,3,Close to airport.,Everything was good. I only spent a short night. I had an early flight the next morning.
Best Western The Inn At Rochester Airport,1,Poor hotel,"Following a fourteen hour drive, we arrived, very tired, to check in at 3 AM on April 17th. I booked a non-smoking room but there was only a smoking room available. We were given the keys to room 410. This is an outside room in the back of the hotel that abuts a truck stop.  I used the bathroom which had water all over the floor, and went back into the main room. The room had stained carpets, lights that didnt work and things just didnt seem particularly clean. However, the bed was nicely made and we were very tired. I pulled back the bed spread to find rumpled sheets covered in blood. I chose to contact Expedia, whose representative contacted the front desk and arranged for a refund of all three reservations booked with this hotel. At my request Expedia also arranged for us to stay at a different hotel in the area. I do not believe that it takes much intelligence to connect the dots and determine what happened here.When we were back in town on Friday we stopped back to the hotel in an attempt to speak with the manager. We were told that he was not in.  I left a message asking that he call me, to which there has been no response. Even though this is a two star hotel, these conditions are disgusting."
Best Western The Inn At Rochester Airport,3,Adequate hotel next to airport and close to U of R,"Nothing special to recommend this hotel, but it's adequate and serviceable."
Best Western The Inn At Rochester Airport,5,A very enjoyable place to stay for any occasion.,"The two days I spent at your Best Western Inn near the Rochester airport, was great before and after my sons graduation ceremony from RIT college.

Blue Haven Motor Court,4,Good night's sleep on short notice,"Very last minute reservation as we finished dinner and started searching for a bed near Kennebunkport. While I don't normally stay at motels, this was a nice surprise. The room smelled like a motel, but was very clean and a fantastic price for the full cabin with 4 beds and a full kitchen. The bed was even comfortable! (I often... More"
Best Western Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Port,2,Smelly room with prank calls,When first walking in the room had a very strong smell of cleaners! We were told that all the rooms had just been cleaned and would smell the same. We got woke up at 1:40am by prank calls. Maybe they need a makeover!
Best Western Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Port,3,Convenience,"Close to port and airport. Next door is a McDonalds. Rooms are clean. Not recommended for a vacation place. You can drive to the restaurants, beach and shops . They cater to the pre and post cruisers and flyers. We had to catch a plane at 7am. and it was great for that. Thats about it."

Best Western Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Port,3,Okay but nothing special,My family and I stayed here one night pre-cruise.

Best Western Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Port,4,very convenient,very happy with convenience of hotel and the shuttle provided to and from the airport. Slamming doors and yelling kids at 5 am was sleep disturbing but the only problem. Great German restaurant down the street
Best Western Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Port,3,Pre-cruise stay,"Nothing too remarkable about this location - it was good value, a good location (close to the cruise port) and had an adequate breakfast (although the breakfast room was overflowing with cruisers on the morning we were there...on Dec. 20, 2015...no surprise there!) We were even given a goody bag with chips and bottles of water when we arrived late... More"

Best Western Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Port,4,Graduation Trip,"I was satisfied for choosing Best Western. I try to always choose a Best Western because of there cost/ benefits of stay comparison. I feel that I get what I pay for and it is reasonable. I didn't expect a pool, so that was a surprise that I was grateful for, as well as my son."
Best Western Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Port,4,Airport hotel,"Hourly shuttle service to the airport. Very reasonable. Room was large, clean and comfortable. Return shuttle service took a little bit of a wait."
Best Western Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Port,3,Good Hotel,"Rooms are clean with basic amenities, but very dated. Beds are comfortable, rooms are fairly quiet, but can definitely hear through the walls. Breakfast is very basic, but fresh. While it is not very close to an amenities, it is good for pre or post cruise stay. Hotel charges 8 per person for ride to cruise ship terminal"
Best Western Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Port,3,Overnight before flight,Overnight stay to catch early flight to Barbados
Best Western Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Port,5,Surprising!,"I was very pleased with this hotel. it was clean and near the airport which is where me and my husband for a flight our of Ft. Lauderdale the next morning. The front desk was helpful. Parking was very easy. And it was not far from the main attraction, Ft Lauderdale Beach. We would definitely stay again :)"
Best Western Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Port,4,"Nice Hotel, But Port Transportation Partner Dishonest","Hotel was very clean, nice amenities, friendly staff. However, the transportation company they partner with are less than honest. They sell you a round trip transportation to cruise port for 60, and then the hotel tries to charge an additional 32 to go to the port."
Best Western Fort Lauderdale Airport/Cruise Port,5,Always wonderful!,"I have become a very loyal customer of Best Western in the last 2 years. This stay before and after my cruise the hotel just proved that I have not wasted my loyalty. Everything was clean, staff was friendly, pool was wonderful, etc... This is why I stay Best Western.

Red Roof Plus+ Wilmington - Newark,1,Never ever ever,"In a word - awful. Called early in the day to ask for a late check in lady was very sassy and snarky rather than just making a note on the reservation. Once actually checked in: room extremely tiny, AC unit very loud, bed uncomfortable. Housekeeping knocked at 8am to clean room - checkout wasn't until 10am..."
Red Roof Plus+ Wilmington - Newark,2,Never again,"I was very disappointed in this hotel. It was not what I expected since it was to be renovated. It took me about 20 minutes to find the entrance. I arrived late at time and a sign with a red background and red lettering was not a good thing. When you add in poor lighting, it definitely was not a good mix. When I checked in there were a few peopled in the lobby and outside. this raised safety concerns. I obtain my keys and receive directions to my room. Again, more people hanging outside. I enter the room and realized the mistake I made. The room was very small with no iron, ironing board or coffeemaker (most hotels provide these basic items). I read the booklet and I learned to enjoy these benefits, I would have to upgrade which I began to think it wouldn't be worth it. The next morning I left the room and there was woman sitting outside in a lawn chair. I returned 3 hours later and she was still there. If it couldn't get worse, when I returned later that night, two men were sitting outside a room, in lounge chairs, music playing and a small grill on the grass. At this point I was relieved that I was leaving in the morning and this would be a distant memory very quickly."
Red Roof Plus+ Wilmington - Newark,1,bed bugs or fleas? ciggarette smoke everywhere etc,worst hotel ever. do not stay here.
Red Roof Plus+ Wilmington - Newark,4,Its okay for the price,Slowest wifi and not a whole lot of TV channels
Red Roof Plus+ Wilmington - Newark,3,Not that bad.,"The comfortable on the bed was very thin, room had no refrigerator nor microwave. Wasn't informed at all that the Ice Machine wasn't working. Room was very clean."
Best Western Plus Eau Claire Conference Center,4,Good Amenities in Dated Decor,"Rooms spacious, including bathroom. Clean and functioning well. Attentive staff. Very dated decor throughout - distracting, but little impact on our experience there. Requested 2 queen as listed on Hotels.com, but hotel offers 2 DOUBLE beds, which is a significant drawback for our family. Free ear plugs because closing doors are LOUD. That might have been the only downside. Pool and hottub were great. Ample supply of towels with extended access hours as compared to some places we've stayed. Breakfast was good, but crowded. Layout is a challenge when busy as several key items are in corners or nooks. No place to line up but through the dining tables, pathway, etc. Would stay here again if the price were right. Otherwise, would be a more modern competitor with queen beds."
Best Western Plus Eau Claire Conference Center,5,Very happy,The only reason I rated the condition a little low is because there was a loose screw in the bathroom threshold that could hurt someones bare foot.
Best Western Plus Eau Claire Conference Center,4,Nice place to stay,I was there for business and it served my needs very well. The room was a good size and the bed was comfortable. The staff is especially friendly and accommodating.
Best Western Plus Eau Claire Conference Center,3,Just an average hotel,The hotel is average and borders on outdated. The internet is unreliable if you can get it to work at all. Housekeeping is questionable. The staff is friendly and appear to care. Good breakfast options.

Fairfield Inn Great Falls,4,Comfortable and convenient,"Room was clean and comfortable. Friendly staff. Convenient location. Good place for families, couples, or business travelers.

Fairfield Inn Great Falls,4,Clean with good customer service!,I want to give this place an accurate review. I stayed here for a week and will be back.

Wilderness Lodge,5,Warmth and relaxation,This family-run lodge exceeded any and all expectations we had from the moment we arrived.

It's hard to a imagine a more perfect place for a group retreat or a family getaway.
Wilderness Lodge,5,Fun Getaway for the Family,"We stayed in the Turkey Run two bottom cabins, perfect for the two families (4 adults and 3 children).

Grasshoppers and other bugs were EVERYWHERE. The best part was the chirping throughout the night, from inside the room. The bathroom was not cleaned thoroughly and I was glad to get out of... More"
Larkspur Landing Renton,4,Felt like home,"We had to stay here for a long period of time. When we first arrived we got there 4 hours before normal check in and they allowed us to get a room!

Larkspur Landing Renton,5,Great Service Comfortable Room,"The staff here was really great - courteous, helpful, well-informed. The room was comfortable and the kitchenette a real boon. Great value for money. If we're in the area we'd stay there again. Breakfast was nice enough, though a bit more variety would have been nice."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Muskegon Heights,1,very poor,dirty room
Red Roof Inn & Suites Muskegon Heights,2,To be honest...,"This is a pet friendly hotel. Having said that, it smells like a pet friendly hotel that does not get a thorough cleaning after a dog has been sick. We were booked into our first room which smelled like a mixture of beef jerky and vomit. Our second room was a little better, but we still had to go buy several candles to make the room habitable. The carpet was sticky, and the sheets were full of holes. The bathtub looked like someone took a blowtorch to a corner. The carpet in the halls is in a severe need of cleaning. Many spots and traffic patterns. The breakfast was good if you like lots of carbs. I came away feeling gross and dirty even after a shower."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Muskegon Heights,1,Stay Away DIRTY SMELLY,Had 3 rooms for our group. One door wouldn't hardly lock. Had strong animal smell. We stayed 5 nights and they did not clean our room once. Definately would not recommend this hotel. Worse hotel I have ever stayed in.
Red Roof Inn & Suites Muskegon Heights,1,Disappointing,If you decide to book this hotel you will be disappointed.

Red Roof Inn & Suites Muskegon Heights,5,Front Desk,"As a guest I was very impressed on how the front desk Clerk handled being in a situation dealing with a deaf guest! Even though it was hard to understand my husband, Stasia did a great job in making us feel welcomed and comfortable."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Muskegon Heights,4,Decent/ Affordable,I generally stay here when I go home for a visit. It is in my budget and well maintained. It is in a good location.
Red Roof Inn & Suites Muskegon Heights,1,Not going back anytime soon.....,"We checked in at 6 pm, 3 hours after check in time of 3pm. Our room wasn't ready and housekeeping staff could be seen standing outside smoking. Granted I was given a 15 discount however, I would have happily paid another 50 per night to not be in that neighborhood. Employees smoking at the door to the lobby, the smell of weed in the hallway, a fight in the parking lot, literally people walking in off the street for the continental breakfast and asking us to use our cell phones, our room was 54 degrees upon entering.... I could go on and on, but won't. Needless to say I would never stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone. Our friends chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. And they would hang out in our room because theirs reeked. Regardless of how much Lysol of ours they used, it smelled. On a scale of 1-10 it was a 1."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Muskegon Heights,1,terrible,it was terrible.it was dirty.the bathroom was not clean.
Red Roof Inn & Suites Muskegon Heights,4,Close to everything,Overbooked the hotel and didn't have our suite available but the staff worked with us and gave us 2 rooms for the price of a suite which worked fine and the rooms were comfortable no problems with anything

Best Western Canal Winchester Inn - Columbus South East,3,Hits all the marks - but not fancy by any means,"The rooms were clean, servers and front desk very courteous. A little expensive at 105++ a night but not bad. Rooms were older - carpets worn. Breakfast decent but not all that good. I would certainly come back (and recommend) as it had comfy beds, working AC and very nice staff."

Microtel Inn Suites by Wyndham Prairie du Chien,4,Clean quiet,"Staff was friendly. Breakfast was great, especially the coffee! It was very modern and up to date. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because we requested a non smoking room, and unfortunately the room smelled like cigarette smoke. They did spray the room, but it only improved it slightly."
Microtel Inn Suites by Wyndham Prairie du Chien,2,Good hotel except for the internet,"Hotel is clean and well kept. Rooms are usual Microtel fare. Water pressure on second floor left something to be desired. Beds are very firm. Biggest issue was internet begin almost unusable after 5 PM. Once more than a handful of people log on, you're plagued with frequent drops and buffering. Really holds back a good hotel."

Microtel Inn Suites by Wyndham Prairie du Chien,4,Very Clean,"Very clean hotel, good breakfast, good value for your money. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars... the single bed rooms are small. I did not get a chance to use the pool, but pool room looked extremely clean as well."

We were finally given a room with double bed. We would have gone elsewhere but ther were no vacanicies in the town. When arriving after driving for hours we were told there was no restroom to use and then trying to get into our room with no success, we ended up going to a restaurant next door. We will never go to the Super 8 in Crawfordsville again.

Super 8 Crawfordsville,2,You get what you pay for !,"The price of the room says it all. It is a cheap hotel room. Clean and OK to stay for a single night when you want a cheap hotel to come in late and stay overnight and get up early and leave. However, the only real big problem with the place is the smell of cigarette smoke that permeates the room!!! It is unbelievable. DO NOT turn on the fan in the bathroom and bring an air freshener. With the LOUD air conditioner on, the room becomes air becomes equalized enough to sleep there. You have been warned !"

Baymont Inn & Suites Celebration,5,Disney Fun,"It was a very lovely stay. The room was so beautiful! Beds so comfy!! Pool was so refreshing!! We will stay again! The thing that was troubling, was check-in with one person, part of information was not correct, when I mentioned this, she stated, well you are staying only one night, Let that go, she did mention it several times. Then was telling us, where the room was, kept pointing behind us and saying right back there, repeating it. We didn't look behind us, so she kept pointing, I said do you want us to look behind us to see where you are pointing Eye roll from her! Breakfast ends at 9 and don't take any food out of that area! Let it go. The best part was she informed us of check out, which was 10, not one minute after, repeated it and do we understand! My patience now about gone, about to ask for a manager and tell her a piece of my mind! My very calm my daughter, who is more patience then I just said thank you and took the keys from her. Walked away, went to our room, went to eat and a dip in the pool, let it that go! The night gentlemen, at your front desk was fabulous, the mini fridge started making noise, and sent someone up. We went to eat the pool, it was looked at it. To bad, that the noise had stop, so we both thought it was fixed. When I said something to the front desk (not same lady) that next morning, she said so very sorry and took the resort fee off. The stay was so very nice, had a beautiful garden area!!! Will stay again!!"

Baymont Inn & Suites Celebration,2,Never ever stay here,"Upon check in our room was not ready. It was a non-smoking room, yet guests prior to us had been smoking inside the room. There was a cigarette butt in the corner of the room that house keeping missed. There was an inch between the outside door and the wall allowing bugs inside of the room. There were not enough wash cloths inside of the room for guests. The next morning my daughter fell in the bathroom in the lobby and hit her chin and hurt her wrist. The day of check out my daughter had hit her toe on the concrete car stop, causing us to go into the ER. The hotel overall was loud and dirty. Upkeep was poor. Poor lighting. We could have paid the same price for a hotel room at a Disney property!"

Le Meridien Atlanta Perimeter,4,Very nice hotel.,"This place is very nice. However, for the room price, they still make you pay extra for wifi, which I found kinda silly. It's 12.95 for wifi per day.

Blue Harbor Resort,1,Breaker Bay: Not What it Used To Be,"I'm a local and have been coming since the resort was built, but on our visit last weekend things dove to a new low.

Blue Harbor Resort,3,Things need to improve,"This was out third Christmas at Blue Harbor, last year and this year we have noticed that things have gone down hill. This year our Condo was not cleaned very well. Dirty carpets, dirty oven, dirty refrigerator, no soap or shampoo in bathrooms. The water park is showing a lot of wear and needs updating and cleaning as well."
Blue Harbor Resort,4,"Fun, but not much To Do","When we arrived, we thought that the pool would suffice as our main form of entertainment, but since the pool was packed beyond belief, we were forced to find other forms of entertainment.

Super 8 Vandalia/dayton International Airport,1,"Super 8 Vandalia, OH.","Room was dirty, black hairs and grass on bathroom floor, tub liner was disgusting, old tube style TV and only had 1 washer and 1 dryer. I have a handicap and was put on the 2nd floor about 11-12 rooms away from the elevator. No luggage carts available which made it difficult for me to bring up my belongings. I would NOT recommend this Super 8 even though it was close to all we wanted to see in the Dayton area."

Baymont Inn & Suites Springfield,2,"Two fire alarms- the 1st @ 1am, 2nd @ 3 am","The response from the desk was basically too bad, not our fault. So much for customer service!!!!"
Baymont Inn & Suites Springfield,1,This hotel was our worst hotel experience ever.,"We arrived in town at 10am, and asked if we could check in early. We realized we were very early, but hoped we could check in before 3pm. We were told we could not check in early, even though the place was almost a ghost town (there were 3 cars in the parking lot (including ours), and I wondered if the other two belonged to the workers. When we came back at 4:30pm to check in, we were told we would need to get a second room as we had 2 teenagers (plus mom dad) and 3 toddlers. We asked if our toddlers could sleep in a pack n play or on the floor. They said no, so we asked for a refund, so we could make arrangements to stay somewhere that would be more accommodating. They refused to give us a refund, and called the cops. The cops arrived a few minutes later. After hearing both sides, the cops asked the hotel to give us a refund, but the hotel refused. After an hour and fifteen minutes, we agreed to stay there for that night and find another hotel for the next night, but still no refund was provided. To top it off, the hotel was terribly dirty and run down. The pool area needs to be painted as you can see the concrete all over. The room was dirty. This was our worst hotel experience ever."
Baymont Inn & Suites Springfield,4,Best Hotel for the value in the area,"Very clean, comfortable, friendly hotel. Nicely maintained pool and spa. Rooms are bright and cheerful. We've stayed in other value-priced hotels at that exit, and this is the nicest by far."
Baymont Inn & Suites Springfield,2,Worn and needs renovation,"Hole in shower, broken toilet seat. Facility is worn and needs to be updated."
Baymont Inn & Suites Springfield,4,Accommodations fine but no elevator,"If it would have just been an overnight stay no elevator would have been ok., However, when you have more than 1 bag and companion not able to walk very well it would have been convenient to have an elevator."

Best Western Plus Midwest Inn Suites,2,Disapointed!,"Stayed overnight after seeing Rascal Flatts concert. Clerk had personality of dry white toast. Not mean or disrespectful, just not particularly friendly. The elevator smelled like a sewer pipe, as if a sewer main had busted and was discharging into the elevator shaft. Room was decent size but bed horribly uncomfortable. Lumpy and right side sagged so bad my wife almost rolled out of bed a couple of times. She is a petite girl, so it wasn't weight or anything, just a worn out mattress! A couple of extra pillows would have been nice, but didn't ask for them so can't really fault the hotel there. The window to the room was literally the wrong size (too small for the opening) so a nice COLD wind blowing into the room all night that the heater struggled to keep up with. End result was room was too hot or too cold, and the heater dried out the air so badly trying to keep up with the cold blast from window, we both had bloody noses in the morning. Not impressed overall. Will pay the extra 20 bucks to stay at the Courtyard next time!"
Best Western Plus Midwest Inn Suites,5,"Quiet, comfortable, easy access","The staff was courteous, the hotel was right off the highway and close to good dining options, as well as a gas station, but quiet.

They were mindful of our online requests, though I made reservations far in... More"
Best Western Plus Midwest Inn Suites,5,zzzzzz!!! We look forward to returning.....,Our stay was excellent! I don't normally give high scores but the hotel and staff were top-notch. Our room was clean and cool. Any time we needed to ask a staff member a question the staff member smiled and was generous in giving information of where things were in the City of Salina and Abilene. I rate the hotel overall a five.
Best Western Plus Midwest Inn Suites,5,Repeat Visitor,"I have stayed at this particular location multiple times over the last several years and have always been happy with the courteous and professional staff. Breakfast is always fresh, tasty and a very good selection of items. The room, lobby, and breakfast areas have always been clean and presentable.

Comfort Suites Redmond Airport,4,Nice room and great staff,"The rooms were nice- the breakfast was good- the staff was very accommodating, helpful, and friendly. This hotel was located equal distance from places we spent time visiting. I have stayed here before and will stay here in the future."
Comfort Suites Redmond Airport,4,"Mixed Bag at Comfort Suites, Redmond","Overall, the stay was good. The staff, however, was a mixed bag. Lady at front desk was friendly enough, but gave us the wrong times for breakfast (telling us that breakfast was served to 10:00 on Fridays when it really stopped at 9:00 my teenage daughters almost missed breakfast). Also, the woman who drives the early morning shuttle to the airport as well as served breakfast on Wednesday morning was extremely RUDE. Made snarky comments to customers in the breakfast room and left a poor family with small children on their way to the airport, telling them that there was no more room in the shuttle when there was plenty of room. (My family were the only people on the shuttle and we pointed out that there was plenty of room and we were fine with waiting while they loaded on, but she would not wait for them.) On the other hand, the nice brunette, younger woman who worked the breakfast room on Thursday through Saturday morning was super friendly and accommodating and even made extra eggs for my daughters on the morning that they almost missed breakfast."
Comfort Suites Redmond Airport,5,great stay!,"very clean, well kept hotel. The staff was friendly and efficient. Nice bonus having a salt water swimming pool and hot tub indoors."
Comfort Suites Redmond Airport,5,LOVE this place!!!,Excellent customer service and the rooms are exceptionally clean. Would not think about staying anywhere else.

Indianhead Motel,5,Excellent Value and Immaculately Clean,"It may look a bit dated as seen from the road and most of the the rooms we have stayed in are on the small side, but the utilization of space and attention to detail is amazing. Breakfast is the basic typical fare, very relaxed in the bright cheerful lobby area."
Americas Best Value Inn,4,On highway 2,"Overall, the room and service were of a good quality. However, management recently changed the cash payment policy, thereby adding a 250 refundable cash deposit, which was not listed on the website for this particular location. Since we were returning to Canada, we needed to spend our American currency first and this created a slight check-in problem, which was handled quite efficiently by the clerk."
Americas Best Value Inn,3,Most uncomfortable beds ever,"Although the employees were very nice and friendly, and the hotel was clean, I cannot give it more stars because the rooms were tiny and the beds were the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on. Blankets were also thin. Continental breakfast was adequate."
Indianhead Motel,5,Great little Ma Pa motel,"This an older motel, but kept in great condition by the owners. Very clean and quiet. Park the motorcycle right outside your room. Reasonalble rates too.

Ocean Breeze Motel,3,Just OK,"I was excited to find this place for a road trip down the Oregon coast, since it had such great reviews from other travelers. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a disappointment. It's located right on the 101, so while very convenient, the road noise is pretty loud in the room (especially if you keep your window open - no...

Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,4,HOJO near Univ of DE,"This was a great value. We upgraded to a suite when we arrived to be near the pool. The room was huge and the staff was friendly although we could've done without the 7 a.m. wake up knock on our door from housekeeping. So don't forget to use your ""do not disturb"" sign. The free continental breakfast was generous and fresh. We would stay here again."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,1,Horrible experience,"The room was old, dirty, run down. The rig was filthy. The drapes were torn. I would never stay there again."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,5,Great,Great
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,5,Excellent!,Staff was very helpful and courteous.
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,1,Horrible,"Location not too bad. Close to lots of restaurant. There were blood on the sheets, I informed the front desk and they didn't even come to change it."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,5,College visit,Nice affordable close to campus. Big rooms. Clean. Great breakfast. Great value
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,4,Good value,"Stayed with many family members attending a family reunion in 6 different rooms. Most room numbers began with 1 so an incorrect assumption was that the rooms were on the first floor. The hotel seems to be on a slight rise and has different levels for the same floor. Our rooms on the same floor were either accessed via entrance 2, which required some stairs or entrance 3 which required no stairs. Note that there is no elevator. Some issues with a couple of rooms, but hotel staff was quick to rectify. My room included a refrigerator and a microwave. Breakfast in the conference room below had make your own waffles, hard-boiled eggs, toast and muffins, and oatmeal - coffee, tea, and juice."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,3,"Large room, reasonable price","Large room and reasonable price. However, old building, needed updating. Breakfast same everyday. No spa tub. Worked for us as we knew we would only be there to shower and sleep and was close to the University where we were visiting our son."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,4,"nice hotel, convenient location, close to amenitie","quiet room, quick check-in, easy parking,hotel staff cordial/ helpful, breakfast exceptional- lots to chose from"
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,1,Never again.,"We were staying for one night for the BOA Marching band competition. I reviewed all the pictures online and read the reviews. You will always have mixed reviews. Based on the information I decided to book the night. The hotel lobby's door was broken. The front staff upon checking in were not personable. They provided us the room and upon entering that part of the hotel, it was not too clean and this had me worried. I had read about a newly renovated part of the hotel and prayed we would have it. No such luck. The room smelled, there was a dirty toothbrush in the corner of the room. There was also a burn mark on the carpet from an iron. I was so embarrased for my family that I actually booked this. We stayed anyway because I did not want to lose my money. Upon waking up my back hurt so bad I couldn't breathe. I could not wait to go home."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,5,No ELEVATOR,"Be prepared for your stay here. We found a Safeway grocers nearby and that made the stay a lot better for our dietary needs. The hotel was well run, but NO ELEVATOR. They even had a waffle maker for breakfast, full choices of on the go breakfast items. The staff were really nice, helpful and knowledgeable. But remember - NO ELEVATOR."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,4,Newark DE Howard Johnson,The hotel is greatly unappreciated for the potential of the service and accomodations. The initial appearance is unfortunate because the facilities could be very nice if kept up. My room was very comfortable and was a bargain for the money.
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,4,"Nice, cheaply priced hotel","Stayed here twice. Nice location, quiet rooms, and good amenities. If you are a night owl, bring your own alcohol and snack, last call in Delaware is 12:45 and the only eateries that are open would be a convenient store or Dunkin Donuts"
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,4,good deal,"Stay in Howard Johnson Inn is a good deal I can find over the Internet around University of Delaware -- Newark area. However, (1) the breakfirst is too simple, not good. (2) One night there was no hot water. (3) Another night there was no Internet connection. (4) they charge early check-in for some $40, that is not friendly. I hope the boss of the hotel can improve their service further and provide kind service. But I thank Hotels.com rewards me a night stay for free."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,3,Howard Johnsons in Newark DE,"The only good feature about the room was the price. Although clean for the most part it was listed as non-smoking but it was clear the room had been smoked in. Maintenance was very poor. The toilet tank cover was missing and the seat would not stay up. The coffee service in the room had not bee replaced in ages. There was a small balcony outside the room but there were holes in the ceiling covering it. Also, the building was not secured at night. Anyone could walk in. The building is old and really needs to be renovated."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,2,"Clean, but not restful.","Not the most restful hotel in the world. The air-freshener made a bleeping noise every 82 seconds and the front desk didn't even try to fix it, preferring to let it bleep through the night. Then room-service banged on my door twice even though the do-not-disturb sign was on the door. Wi-Fi bandwidth -- was great, room was clean."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,3,HOJO,"Good for the price. The handle on sink popped off when we first arrived, but they fixed it promptly. Staff all had smiles and were very helpful."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,2,Cold and the mattress was awful.,Front counter friendly but the bed was very uncomfortable and the tub was dirty and drained slow.
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,1,Absolutly Dirty,The room was absolutely horrible. It stunk an was hidious slept on couch because bed look like sheets never been washed. Do not stay here for your own health.

Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,5,great stay,Quiet. Clean. Friendly. Reasonable. What more could i ask for
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,3,Convenient and clean,"Second time stayed here as an overnight stop towards our destination. Room was clean. Friendly's next door. Close to I-95. Typical continental breakfast.....bagels, waffle maker, yogurt, fruit, cereal, etc."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,1,DONT EVER STAY HERE!!!,"The stay was for business and the room booked through my office. It was prepaid through Expedia. The room was FILTHY!!! Stains, burn marks, bugs, and it smelled terribly of smoke (booked a non-smoking room). The bathroom was extremely dirty and there was no way I could shower in it. One light in the room worked, all others did not. I video taped it because I had never experienced anything like this. I immediately went back to the manager and expressed my concern. He would not give me a refund so I told him I would take it up with my office and their credit card company. There was no way I was going to stay there. I drove home 2 hours and had to drive back the next day for my business event. It was that bad and I refused to stay there."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,5,Great place to stay,"I have worked at Disney for the last 8 years, so I am very hard to please. We did not have a lot of money to spend on this trip. I was very reluctant to stay in a cheap hotel. To my surprise this hotel was clean, comfortable, the breakfast was great. I will stay at this hotel again. I was pleasantly surprised."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,4,Visiting relation,I don't stay in hotels much. I was just looking for a cheap place to stay to visit relation in the area..
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,3,not so great this time,i will stay here again can't beat the price but was not impressed this time. This is the 3rd time I have stayed here in 2 weeks. I was in line at the front desk to check in (1 person ahead of me and literally 3 families totaling 15 people behind me and the guy at the desk spent five minutes on the phone while everyone waited talking apparently to his manager about who was coming to relieve him because he though someone quit. I stayed in the 3rd building this time and it was a huge difference from building 1 which was nice. Building 3 is not in as good a shape the halls were dirty and it was like going into the motel 6. def should stay in building 1
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,2,would not recommend,the rooms ac was leaking causing the floor to be wet around the window and ac. the hair dryer and phone didnt work. the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night. the sheets had crumbs and sparkles on them. Maintenance fixed the problems but its ridiculous they dont inspect their products.
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,5,Very convenient.,Great location. Front desk staff very accommodating. Will go back.
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,1,disgusting room would not recommend at all,"I didn't stay. I checked in for about an hour and was totally disgusted from what I saw and smelled..Room was dirty, the sliding glass door was broken and it had no screen to cover the door if u opened it. Furniture was broken, the refrigerator was dirty, the curtains had cigarette burns and dirt marks all over them. I would not recommend this hotel at all."
Red Roof Inn & Suites Newark-university,4,Howard Johnson's Newark,"I was very satisfied with this hotel for the price. It offers a breakfast, free internet and an exercise room all included with a decent room that has all of the things to make your stay easier. The exercise room is small and the breakfast has limited options, but for the price is better than several more expensive places that offer neither."
Holiday Inn Express & Suites Houston Space Ctr - Clear Lake,5,Excellent stay,This hotel is new and extremely clean (trust me...I checked every corner -) ) and the nice girl at the counter (I think her name was Tari or something similar) was very helpful and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend this hotel. It is right behind a big shopping center and just 30 minutes from Galveston
Buccaneer Beach Motel,4,Nice views,Currently here with my husband. It's a clean hotel with a great view. Room 303 looks right out over the water. TV didn't come with a remote but that was rectified quickly. Good place to chill out away from it all. I'll come back.

Hampton Inn Horse Cave,4,Hampton Inn consistency,The staff was friendly and helpful. I love Hampton Inns. Every Hampton inn is the same. It is consistent. Unlike other chain hotels which may be franchised. You always know a Hampton will be comfortable and clean.

Red Roof Inn Durham-duke University Medical Center,4,Pretty Cool Place,My stay here was pretty cool for the 1st time. This was my 1st time getting a hotel by myself and the experience was cool and relaxing. At 1st I was hesitant about getting a hotel here because of the rating but good thing I decided to check it out for myself. The only few thing was that the bathroom fan is loud and the actual unit only blew out cold air. But other than that it was very relaxing.

We came down for the Nascar races and we were happy with each visit. My boys and I recommend Marriott for a great place to stay in Vegas"
Residence Inn By Marriott Las Vegas South,5,nice & convenient,nice clean. conveniently located to strip. shuttles to mandalay bay new york new york every half hour
Residence Inn By Marriott Las Vegas South,4,Sleepness Night,"The room itself was as expected. I had no disappointments with the accommodations. The bus service to the strip was an added bonus. Unfortunately, we had a room closest to the IH-15 and facing towards the Las Vegas Strip and Las Vegas Airport. I didn't sleep very well due to the departing airplanes and the shrieks from the patrons riding the roller coaster at the New York, New York hotel. I suggest asking for a room facing away from the strip."
Residence Inn By Marriott Las Vegas South,5,Always a Great Place,"I stay here at least once a year for the last 3. I hate the strip hotels/traffic, this is a great alternative to the strip but within minutes if you are going to the strip or any where else in Vegas and minutes from the airport and only a minute from the freeway. Quiet, clean, comfortable and nice staff."
Residence Inn By Marriott Las Vegas South,5,off strip,Will definitely return as this suite had everything I needed and more!
The Sea Lion Motel,4,Very nice,"Nice and close to everything. The staff are very nice, helpful and friendly. We had a room that looked out to the ocean at a distance. Nice heated pool.

Days Inn Maui Oceanfront,4,Adequate and very convenient.,"I was looking for a (relatively) inexpensive place to stay for a week long course. The hotel was conveniently located for me. It has excellent beach access. Rooms are small with some inconveniences, but adequate. Parking spaces are way too narrow. You can park entirely within the marked lines and still have trouble getting into and out of your car. Overall it met my needs, and I would certainly consider staying there again."
Days Inn Maui Oceanfront,4,Maui on a Budget,We have stayed in many condos and resorts across Maui. We wanted to add a few nights on a budget and this place was perfect. The rooms are really small but they have them very organized. The staff was very friendly and it never seemed as if we were bothering them.
Days Inn Maui Oceanfront,3,Cramped quarters on beach,"Great location on the beach, but rooms are really tiny, especially the bathroom. The free wireless internet is useless, as in our three day stay, the signal was too week to access, not even once - despite our room's nearness to the management office. No excuse for that."
Days Inn Maui Oceanfront,5,Ocean Views,"A great location for beautiful sunsets, great food close by, and whale watching! We really enjoyed our stay."

The Roosevelt Hotel,5,Great Seattle Location,The Roosevelt staff is very friendly and ready with suggestions for tours and restaurants. The room was spacious and clean. Being centrally located it is an ideal spot for reaching all of downtown Seattle. Additionally it is easy to reach via LINK light rail public transportation from the airport.

Mamaroneck Motel,3,No AC controls in room!,"AC is central but controlled in office in blocks of 10 rooms.

Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,5,Excellent accomodations,Comfortable and clean room and bathroom. Delicious breakfast.

Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,5,Brilliant,Good location. Excellent staff. Brilliant stay. Accommodation was clean and room spacious enough considering it is located in heart of the city. Magnificent mile on doorstep almost. Although hotel was full with nfl draft visitors the hotel maintains high standard. No hesitation to recommend
Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,2,Overcharged,They double-charged us for valet parking. For 2 nights we paid over 260 and they have yet to reimburse us. Expect to wait over 45 minutes to have your car fetched from the valet and pre-arrange for them to retrieve it before check-out.
Hampton Inn Chicago Downtown/N Loop/Michigan Ave,4,Great Location for walking around,"Good location to get around on foot and see Chicago. We walked to Navy Pier, Millennium Park, restaurants, etc. The lobby is beautiful. The staff was friendly. Other reviews have complained about city noise (sirens and such) but it was not a problem in my opinion. You hear them, obviously, because you are in the city, but it's not constant."
Budget Host Inn,5,Nice Hotel,"Nice Hotel Very friendly staff, Nice Breakfast Enjoyed the stay very much. Nice large bathroom"
Budget Host Inn,4,Good Value,"Very good value for the price. This motel is well run, clean, and the staff are very pleasant."
Budget Host Inn,3,Nice stay.,"Room was very clean, staff was friendly, continental breakfast included. Did not have any extra outlets for charging electronic devices. This may be resolved as the staff took our advice to install an outlet extender that was screwed in so it could not be taken from the room. Overall a nice stay for the price."
Budget Host Inn,3,Low cost for old hotel,"If you don't mind staying in an old hotel for one night for a low rate, then you won't mind staying here. However, this hotel is something from the 1960s and needs alot of updates. Was clean though."

Lake Allatoona Inn,2,Advertised: Home on the lake. Not on the lake!,"We stayed at the Allatoona Inn's lake home.

Wyndham Garden Elk Grove Village/o'hare,1,Awful Customer Service - Worst Airport Shuttle Service,"I try to be fair and objective in my TripAdvisor reviews, because I take others' reviews seriously when booking a hotel.

Hampton Inn & Suites Seattle/federal Way,5,Family visit,Great service and food. No complaints they were very hospitable. When I travel I try to stay at the Hampton inn if there's one near by.

Fairfield Inn and Suites Asheboro,5,Very good,Very nice place to stay when in Asheboro. Staff is super friendly. Rooms are what you would expect for a Fairfield and clean. Free breakfast is actually quite nice with plenty of options. I would certainly recommend this hotel to business travelers.
Courtyard Richland Columbia Point,1,Don't Stay Here,"While the property is new and has great potential, they also have the rudest staff Management I have ever experienced. I'm a platnium Marriott member and have never before been to a hotel that tried so hard to make me uncomfortable. I shortened a 7 nite stay to 1 nite and found another hotel in the area that was happy to have my business and make me feel comfortable."
Courtyard Richland Columbia Point,4,nice find,"We stayed here during a business trip to the tri-cities area. The hotel is well located and very new feeling.

Courtyard Richland Columbia Point,5,Always an enjoyable stay.,"We visit every year for wine tasting. The Richland Courtyard by Marriot is always a excellent experience. The rooms on the ground floor are especially nice with high ceilings. The riverside views are nice, but I prefer the other side as there is some traffic noise from the highway bridge, even though it's quite a distance away."

Courtyard Boston Marlborough,4,Nice and up-to-date hotel - sometimes AC or heating can be noisy,The hotel is clean and pretty much up-to-date. Staff is very friendly and helpful. The annoying thing sometimes can be that the heating or a/c can be really noisy. The trick is to heat/cool up your room enough during the day time so that you can shut it completely down during the night.
"Country Inn & Suites By Carlson, Prairie du Chien",4,Graduation stay,It was a nice hotel with a good water park for the kids. The continental breakfast was good and they had a good selection of food. The bunk beds for the kids were cheap though and a little wobbly. TV's are old tube televisions which I haven't seen in years.
Courtyard Santa Fe,4,Quiet room in good location for reasonable rate.,"For a long weekend away, the Courtyard on Cerrillos Road was a very good choice.

Circle D Motel,5,Felt like our own place,Loved having a space that we felt could be our own instead of a motel room. Very clean and everything we needed for cooking.

Circle D Motel,5,Clean and functional,"This motel was a good surprise. Our room was very clean, and still smelled of bleach. The floor is hardwood, not carpet.

Best Western Continental Inn,3,Go here to see the elephant!,"All in all, an OK experience. They have a little continental breakfast every morning, so that is nice. There is a Denny's across the street, so I did that a few mornings because I am a fan of a big breakfast variety. There is a gas station right next to the hotel that has a good selection of drinks and snacks, so that was a bonus because I didn't have to walk or drive far to get these items. A shout out to whoever makes the towel elephants. I couldn't bring myself to take it apart, it was so cool looking!"
Best Western Continental Inn,1,Never ever,"Never ever again. The rate for this rooms are to high. Dirty old room,smells like an ex smoking room. Keep the doors closed ,Highway behind the Window and Moskitos. Personal is not friendly. Badest Best Western i ever had."

Best Western Continental Inn,4,Stayed One Night,"Booked the hotel during July 4th weekend because it was relatively close to Sea World. Paid double the normal rate because of the holiday weekend as usual. Just needed a place to stay the night and was cheaper than surrounding hotels. Room was clean, staff was friendly at check in. No complaints and would stay again in the future."
Best Western Continental Inn,1,Broken shower,Room had a bad smell and shower did not work. Room was not clean. It had a drity bathroom. Spoke to front desk and they did nothing. Call customer service did help by giving a free night stay. Rooms do not look like the pictures.
Best Western Continental Inn,4,A very comfortable stay,The bed was very comfy and the breakfast was good plus the location was good close to stores and resturaunts. Loved the Jacuzzi tub very relaxing.

Royal Suite Lodge,1,Polde,"Filthy, outdated, noisy neighbours, but this was not the worst. We were nearly eaten by the bed bugs, more agressive than Denali bears. I would not reccomend this hole even to my worst enemy. Next day we needed medical help."
