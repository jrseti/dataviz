# Conditional List Comprehensions

## Instructions

Use conditional list comprehensions to create the following lists:

* Make a list of numbers up to 100 that are divisible by three
* Using the given list of pets, create a list of all the names that belong to dogs
* Make a list of numbers up to 100 that are divisible by three OR divisible by five

**Hint:** Remember the modulo operator (%) !

x % y gives the remainder if x is divided by y. So, for instance x % 2 will be 0 when x is even, and 1 when x is odd

**Bonus:** Make a list comprehension that implements FizzBuzz on the last list created (multiples of 3 and 5)
FizzBuzz replaces multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz" and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz"
**Hint:** use a conditional in the expression at the beginning of the list comprehension
